Easy Multiplicity Control in Equivalence Testing Using Two One-Sided Tests,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2009.0029,MAY 2009,27,19,"The use of equivalence testin g in scientific research is increasing beyond its traditional role in the drug approval process. Largely due to its ease Of use and recommendations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidance, the most common statistical method for testing equivalence is the two one-sided tests (TOST) procedure. Like classical point-null hypothesis testing, TOST is subject to multiplicity concerns as more comparisons are made. Here we give a condition that bounds the familywise error rate (FWER) Using TOST and leads to a simple solution for controlling the FWER. Specifically, we demonstrate that if all pairwise comparisons of k independent groups are being evaluated for equivalence, then simply scaling the nominal type I error rate down by (k - 1) is Sufficient to maintain the FWER at the desired value or less. The resulting rule is much less conservative than the equally simple Bonferroni correction. An example of equivalence testing in a non-drug development setting is given.","Bioequivalence,Familywise error rate,Multiple comparisons,t-test,Two one-sided tests,Type I error rate","OPTIMAL CONFIDENCE SETS,COMPARATIVE BIOAVAILABILITY,BIOEQUIVALENCE TRIALS,BAYESIAN-APPROACH,INTERVALS,POWER,RESPECT","Lauzon, Carolyn@Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biophys, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA::Caffo, Brian@Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biostat, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Lauzon, Carolyn@Johns Hopkins University::Caffo, Brian@Johns Hopkins University",not exist,"A NEW PROCEDURE FOR TESTING EQUIVALENCE IN COMPARATIVE BIOAVAILABILITY AND OTHER CLINICAL-TRIALS+ANDERSON, S; HAUCK, WW+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1983::Assessing equivalence: An alternative to the use of difference tests for measuring disparities in vaccination coverage+Barker, LE; Luman, ET; McCauley, MM; et al.+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+DEC 1 2002::Radiopaque alginate microcapsules for X-ray visualization and immunoprotection of cellular therapeutics+Barnett, B.

On the Assessment of Monte Carlo Error in Simulation-Based Statistical Analyses,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2009.0030,MAY 2009,22,61,"Statistical experiments, more commonly referred to as Monte Carlo Or Simulation studies, are used to study the behavior of statistical methods and measures under controlled situations. Whereas recent computing and methodological advances have permitted increased efficiency in the simulation process, known as variance reduction, such experiments remain limited by their finite nature and hence are Subject to uncertainty; when a simulation is run more than once, different results are obtained. However, virtually no emphasis has been placed on reporting the uncertainty, referred to here as Monte Carlo error, associated with simulation results in the published literature, or on justifying the number of replications used. These deserve broader consideration. Here we present a series of simple and practical methods for estimating Monte Carlo error as well as determining the number of replications required to achieve a desired level of accuracy. The issues and methods are demonstrated with two simple examples, one evaluating operating characteristics of the maximum likelihood estimator for the parameters in logistic regression and the other in the context of using the bootstrap to obtain 95% confidence intervals. The results suggest that in many settings, Monte Carlo error may be more substantial than traditionally thought.","Bootstrap,Jackknife,Replication","APPROXIMATION,MODELS,EM","Koehler, Elizabeth@Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Biostat, Nashville, TN 37232 USA::Brown, Elizabeth@Univ Washington, Dept Biostat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA::Haneuse, Sebastien J. -P.

Over the years, statisticians have pointed out roadblocks to recruiting, offered Suggestions for improving recruiting, and commented in general about the attractiveness of statistics to ""outsiders."" Here we review the statistical literature to identify obstacles to and strategies for recruiting students of statistics. Furthermore, from a more general body of literature, we identify recruiting strategies that may be suitable for statistics. We organize the obstacles and detours around them into a recruiting map and suggest the types of statistician suited for traveling the roads. In addition, we provide tips for generating and evaluating recruiting strategies.","Career choice,Recruiting,Statistical education,Undergraduates","STATISTICS PROFESSION,FUTURE,RECRUITMENT,DISCIPLINE,PROGRAMS","Landes, Reid D.@Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Dept Biostat, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA","Landes, Reid D.@University of Arkansas Medical Sciences@University of Arkansas System",not exist,"no title+*AM STAT ASS+CARR STAT+2008::no title+*AM STAT ASS+CURR GUID UND PROGR+2008::no title+BENTLEY DL+P STAT ED SECT AM ST+1991::no title+BERMAN N+YOU CONSULT STAT WHA+2003::no title+BOCK ME+AMSTAT NEWS+2007::STEMming the tide: Using career week activities to recruit future chemists+Bopegedera, AMRP+JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION+OCT 2005::THE FUTURE OF STATISTICS AS A DISCIPLINE+BRADLEY, RA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1982::Developing Tomorrow's Statisticians+Bryce, G.R.+Journal of Statistics Education+2005::no title+CARRIQUIRY A+AMSTAT NEWS+2007::no title+COLBY MM+AM STAT+1970::OFFICIAL AGENCIES AND PROBLEMS OF RECRUITMENT TO THE STATISTICAL FIELD+DENSEN, PM; SARDY, H+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+1964::no title+EBY LM+STAT ED CAN ATTRACT+2006::Statisticians' significance+Ellenberg, JH+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2000::Geography undergraduate program essentials: Recruitment+Estaville, LE; Brown, BJ; Caldwell, S+JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY+JAN-FEB 2006::no title+GRAY MW+AMSTAT NEWS+2005::no title+GRAY MW+P JOINT STAT M+2004::no title+Hayes, R; Grossman, D.+A Scientist's Guide to Talking with the Media: Practical Advice from the Union of Concerned Scientists+2006::Let's use CQI in our statistics programs+Hogg, RV+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+FEB 1999::STATISTICAL EDUCATION - IMPROVEMENTS ARE BADLY NEEDED+HOGG, RV+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+NOV 1991::no title+HOLMES S+IMS B+2007::NEW PARADIGMS FOR THE STATISTICS PROFESSION+IMAN, RL+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1995::no title+JOYCE H+PLUS+2002::no title+LEE T+CAREERJOURNAL COM+2002::Does the statistics profession have an identity crisis?+Mason, RL+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2004::no title+MENNINGER H+COMMUNICATING SCI PR+2008::THE VISIBILITY OF STATISTICS AS A DISCIPLINE+MINTON, PD+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+1983::OPERATIONS-RESEARCH AND SYSTEMS-ANALYSIS+MISER, HJ+SCIENCE+1980::Statistics and mathematics: Tension and cooperation+Moore, DS; Cobb, GW+AMERICAN MATHEMATICAL MONTHLY+AUG-SEP 2000::Undergraduate programs and the future of academic statistics+Moore, DS+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+FEB 2001::no title+MOORE TL+ASA BOARD STRAT IN W+2004::no title+no author+Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) Completions Survey, 1995-2005+2007::no title+SEVIER RA+J COLL ADMISSION+2000::THE BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL-SCIENCES+SIMON, HA+SCIENCE+1980::The teaching of statistics in UK universities+Smith, T.

It consists of a rectangular tiling, with each tile shaded on a color scale to represent the value of the corresponding element of the data matrix. The rows (columns) of the tiling are ordered such that similar rows (columns) are near each other. On the vertical and horizontal margins of the tiling are hierarchical cluster trees. This cluster heat map is a synthesis of several different graphic displays developed by statisticians over more than a century. We locate the earliest sources of this display in late 19th century publications, and trace a diverse 20th century statistical literature that provided a foundation for this most widely used of all bioinformatics displays.","Cluster analysis,Heatmap,Microarray,Visualization","PROXIMITY MEASURES,DECOMPOSITION,SERIATION,PATTERNS","Wilkinson, Leland@SYSTAT Inc, Chicago, IL 60622 USA::Friendly, Michael@York Univ, Dept Psychol, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada","Wilkinson, Leland@Unknow::Friendly, Michael@York University - Canada",not exist,"no title+Andrade, M.+Heatmap+2008::A rating formulation for ordered response categories+Andrich, D.+Psychometrika+1978::no title+BARJOSEPH Z+BIOINFORMATICS+2003::no title+BERTIN J+SEMIOLOGIE GRAPHIQUE+1967::no title+BRINTON WC+GRAPHIC METHODS PRES+1914::Generalized association plots: Information visualization via iteratively generated correlation matrices+Chen, CH+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 2002::Rearrangement clustering: Pitfalls, remedies, and applications+Climer, Sharlee; Zhang, Weixiong+JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH+JUN 2006::Zur differential Diagnose der Neandertalgruppe+Czekanowski, J.+Korrespondenz- Blatt Der Deutschen Gesellschaft Fur Anthropologie+1909::Cluster analysis and display of genome-wide expression patterns+Eisen, MB; Spellman, PT; Brown, PO; et al.+PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA+DEC 8 1998::no title+FFIENDLY M+AM STAT+2002::Effect ordering for data displays+Friendly, M; Kwan, E+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+AUG 28 2003::UNCLASSED MATRIX SHADING AND OPTIMAL ORDERING IN HIERARCHICAL CLUSTER-ANALYSIS+GALE, N; HALPERIN, WC; COSTANZO, CM+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+1984::NEW MODEL FOR SCALING RESPONSE PATTERNS - APPLICATION OF QUASI-INDEPENDENCE CONCEPT+GOODMAN, LA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1975::no title+GOWER JC+INTERPRETING MULTIVA+1981::2 ADDITIONS TO HIERARCHICAL CLUSTER ANALYSIS+GRUVAEUS, G; WAINER, H+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1972::The basis for scalogram analysis+Guttman, L.+&lt;IT&gt;Measurement and Prediction&lt;/IT&gt;, Vol. IV, &lt;IT&gt;The American Soldier&lt;/IT&gt;+1950::CLOSE-PROXIMITY ANALYSIS - ANOTHER VARIATION ON THE MINIMUM-SPANNING-TREE PROBLEM+HAGE, P; HARARY, F+CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY+AUG-OCT 1995::no title+HARTIGAN J+BMDP BIOMEDICAL COMP+1974::no title+Hartigan, J A.+Clustering Algorithms+1975::SERIATION USING ASYMMETRIC PROXIMITY MEASURES+HUBERT, L+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1976::SOME APPLICATIONS OF GRAPH THEORY AND RELATED NONMETRIC TECHNIQUES TO PROBLEMS OF APPROXIMATE SERIATION - CASE OF SYMMETRIC PROXIMITY MEASURES+HUBERT, L+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1974::A STATISTICAL APPROACH TO FLINDERS PETRIES SEQUENCE-DATING+KENDALL, DG+BULLETIN OF THE INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL INSTITUTE+1963::The practice of cluster analysis+Kettenring, JR+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+2006::Clustering a data array and the traveling-salesman problem+Lenstra, J.K.+Operations Research+March-April 1974::no title+LIIV I+THESIS TALLINN U TEC+2008::COMPUTER GENERATED AID FOR CLUSTER ANALYSIS+LING, RF+COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM+1973::Robust singular value decomposition analysis of microarray data+Liu, L; Hawkins, DM; Ghosh, S; et al.+PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA+NOV 11 2003::no title+Loua, T.+Atlas statistique de la population de Paris+1873::PROBLEM DECOMPOSITION AND DATA REORGANIZATION BY A CLUSTERING TECHNIQUE+MCCORMICK, WT; SCHWEITZER, PJ; WHITE, TW+OPERATIONS RESEARCH+1972::Dendrogram seriation using simulated annealing+Morris, S.A.; Asnake, B.; Yen, G.G.+Information Visualization+June 2003::no title+Nie, N.

Splitting a Predictor at the Upper Quarter or Third and the Lower Quarter or Third,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2009.0001,FEB 2009,22,26,"A linear regression of y on x can be approximated by a simple difference: the average values of y corresponding to the highest quarter or third of x, minus the average values of y corresponding to the lowest quarter or third of x. A simple theoretical analysis, similar to analyses that have been done in psychometrics, shows this comparison to perform reasonably well, with 80%-90% efficiency compared to the regression if the predictor is uniformly or normally distributed. By discretizing x into three categories, we claw back about half the efficiency lost by the commonly used strategy of dichotomizing the predictor.

We illustrate with the example that motivated our research: an analysis of income and voting which we had originally performed for a scholarly journal but then wanted to communicate to a general audience.","Discretizing,Linear regression,Statistical communication,Trichotomizing","EXTREME GROUPS,SELECTION,RULE","Gelman, Andrew@Columbia Univ, Dept Stat, New York, NY 10027 USA@Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA::Park, David K.@George Washington Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA","Gelman, Andrew@Columbia University::Park, David K.@George Washington University",not exist,"Income, economic voting, and long-term political change in the US, 1952-1996+Brooks, C; Brady, D+SOCIAL FORCES+JUN 1999::NOTE ON GROUPING+COX, DR+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1957::THE UPPER AND LOWER 27 PER-CENT RULE+CURETON, EE+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1957::27 PERCENT RULE REVISITED+DAGOSTINO, RB; CURETON, EE+EDUCATIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+1975::THE USE OF EXTREME GROUPS TO TEST FOR THE PRESENCE OF A RELATIONSHIP+FELDT, LS+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1961::USING THE EXTREME GROUPS STRATEGY WHEN MEASURES ARE NOT NORMALLY DISTRIBUTED+FOWLER, RL+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+SEP 1992::no title+Gelman,, A.; Park,, D.; Shor,, B.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Bafumi,, J.

Sample Surveys With Sensitive Questions: A Nonrandomized Response Approach,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2009.0002,FEB 2009,40,21,"Since the Warner's randomized response.(RR) model to solicit sensitive information was proposed in 1965, it has been used and extended in a broad ran e of surveys involving sensitive questions. However, it is limited, for example, by a lack of reproducibility and trust from the interviewees as well as higher cost due to the use of randomizing devices. Recent developments of the alternative non-randomized response (NRR) approach have shown the promise to alleviate or eliminate such limitations. However, the efficiency and feasibility of the NRR models have not been adequately studied. This article introduces briefly the NRR approach, proposes several new NRR models, compares the efficiency of the NRR and RR models and studies the feasibility of the NRR models. In addition, we propose the concept of the degree of privacy protection between the NRR model and the Warner model to reflect the extent the privacy is protected. These Studies show that not only the NRR approach is free of the limitations of the randomized approach but also the NRR model actually increases the relative efficiency and the degree of privacy protection. Thus, the non-randomized response approach offers an attractive alternative to the randomized response approach.","Nonrandomized response models,Randomized response technique,Randomizing device,Sensitive questions,Warner model","RANDOMIZED-RESPONSE,MODEL,EFFICIENCY,DEVICE","Tan, Ming T.@Univ Maryland, Greenebaum Canc Ctr, Div Biostat, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA@Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Dept Epidemiol & Prevent Med, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA::Tian, Guo-Liang@Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China::Tang, Man-Lai@Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Math, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Tan, Ming T.@University System of Maryland@University of Maryland Baltimore::Tian, Guo-Liang@University of Hong Kong::Tang, Man-Lai@Hong Kong Baptist University","Tang, Man@B-4326-2009::HKBU, Mathematics@B-5086-2009::Tang, Man Lai@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6460-8136","A multi-proportions randomized response model+Abul-Ela, A.

A Simple Explanation of Benford's Law,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2009.0005,FEB 2009,9,33,"Benford's Law, also known as the first-digit law, has long been seen as a tantalizing and mysterious law of nature. Attempts to explain it range from the Supernatural to the measure-theoretical. and applications range from fraud detection to computer disk space allocation. Publications on the topic have escalated in recent years, largely covering investigation of the law in different data sources, applications in fraud and computer science, and new probability theorems. The underlying reason why Benford's Law occurs is, however, elusive. Many researchers have verified for themselves that the law is widely obeyed, but have also noted that the popular explanations are not completely satisfying. In this article we do nothing rigorous, but provide a simple, intuitive explanation of why and when the law applies. It is intended that the explanation should be accessible to school students and anyone with a basic knowledge of probability density curves and logarithms.","First-digit phenomenon,Law of anomalous numbers",,"Fewster, R.

This gives rise to several mistakes. Thus, ill a first course in statistics, it is necessary to introduce them to a more general concept of mean. In this work we present the notion of mean suggested by Oscar Chisini in 1929, which has a double advantage. It focuses students' minds on the substance of the problem for which a mean is required, thus discouraging any automatic procedure, and it does not require a preliminary list of the different mean formulas.

Latent Gold (R) is a product of Statistical Innovations whereas MCLUST and poLCA are packages written in R and are available through the web site http:// wwwr.r-project.org. We use a single dataset and apply each software package to develop a latent class cluster analysis for the data. This allows us to compare the features and the resulting clusters from each software package. Each software package has its strengths and weaknesses and we compare the software from the perspectives of usability, cost, data characteristics, and performance. Whereas each software package Utilizes the same methodology, we show that each results in a different cluster solution and suggest some rationales for deciding which package to Use.","Latent class models,Latent Gold (R),MCLUST,Mixture models,poLCA",,"Haughton, Dominique@Bentley Univ, DART, Waltham, MA 02452 USA::Legrand, Pascal@Bentley Univ, DART, Waltham, MA 02452 USA@CRCGM, ESC Clermont, DART Grp, Clermont Ferrand, France::Woolford, Sam@Bentley Univ, DART, Waltham, MA 02452 USA","Haughton, Dominique@Unknow::Legrand, Pascal@Unknow::Woolford, Sam@Unknow",not exist,"Recommendation systems with purchase data+Bodapati, Anand V.+JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH+FEB 2008::no title+CHINN MD+1305 IZA FORSCH ZUK+2004::The determinants of the global digital divide: a cross-country analysis of computer and internet penetration+Chinn, Menzie D.; Fairlie, Robert W.+OXFORD ECONOMIC PAPERS-NEW SERIES+JAN 2007::A longitudinal analysis of customer satisfaction and share of wallet: Investigating the moderating effect of customer characteristics+Cooil, Bruce; Keiningham, Timothy L.; Aksoy, Lerzan; et al.+JOURNAL OF MARKETING+JAN 2007::Exploring break-points and interaction effects among predictors of the international digital divide+Deichmann, J.

"Regression to the Mean, Murder Rates, and Shall-Issue Laws",AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313008X362446,NOV 2008,17,4,"The relationship between state Murder rates and the liberalization of conditions under which a citizen can obtain a permit to carry a concealed weapon (shall-issue laws) is controversial and important for policy. Many analyses have been done during the last decade, but regression to the mean has been ignored with the exception of two papers which concluded that it did not matter. We consider state Murder rates for 1976-2001 and compare relative Murder rate slopes (relative to the U.S. Murder rate) for the five years following state adoption of shall-issue laws to the five years preceding for the 25 states becoming shall-issue in 1981-1996. We find strong evidence for regression to the mean. Using both a random and a fixed effects model, we compare analyses ignoring the regression effect via a paired t-test to those controlling for it by conditioning oil the pre shall-issue slopes. We find that controlling for regression to the mean changes the sign of the estimated intervention effect oil murder rate slopes from negative to positive, has strong impact on statistical significance, and gives no support to the hypothesis that shall-issue laws have beneficial effects in reducing murder rates.","Concealed carry,Homicide,Poisson regression,Regression effect,Statistical regression","CARRY CONCEALED HANDGUNS,CRIME,HOMICIDE,GUNS","Grambsch, Patricia@Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Grambsch, Patricia@University of Minnesota Twin Cities@University of Minnesota System",not exist,"Shooting down the ""more guns, less crime"" hypothesis+Ayres, I; Donohue, JJ+STANFORD LAW REVIEW+APR 2003::no title+BARTLEY WA+EC ENQUIRY+1998::no title+BISHOP YMM+DISCRETE MULTIVARIAT+1976::Do right-to-carry laws deter violent crime?+Black, DA; Nagin, DS+JOURNAL OF LEGAL STUDIES+JAN 1998::More guns, more crime+Duggan, M+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+OCT 2001::Using Placebo Laws to test ''more guns, less crime.''+Helland, Eric; Tabarrok, Alexander.+Advances in Economic Analysis and Policy+2004::The effect of nondiscretionary concealed weapon carrying laws on homicide+Hepburn, L; Miller, M; Azrael, D; et al.+JOURNAL OF TRAUMA-INJURY INFECTION AND CRITICAL CARE+MAR 2004::no title+Lott, John R.+More Guns, Less Crime: Understanding Crime and Gun Control-Laws+2000::Crime, deterrence, and right-to-carry concealed handguns+Lott, JR; Mustard, DB+JOURNAL OF LEGAL STUDIES+JAN 1997::no title+MANNING W+EVALUATING GUN POLIC+2003::REGRESSION TOWARD THE MEAN AND THE PAIRED SAMPLE T-TEST+MEE, RW; CHUA, TC+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+FEB 1991::Testing for the effects of concealed weapons laws: Specification errors and robustness+Moody, CE+JOURNAL OF LAW &amp; ECONOMICS+OCT 2001::Does the right to carry concealed handguns deter countable crimes?

Parametric Nonparametric Statistics: An Introduction to Mixtures of Finite Polya Trees,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313008X366983,NOV 2008,47,10,"We present an introduction to an exciting approach to Bayesian nonparametrics, mixtures of Polya trees (MPTs). MPTs can be viewed as a simple generalization of standard parametric statistical distributions. MPTs use a partition of the support of the original distribution's density. The more general density retains the shape of the original distribution on each partition set but adds new parameters that are conditional probabilities. This provides a highly flexible family of distributions, one that is appropriate for nonparametric fitting. MPTs allow for data-driven features to emerge that are sometimes surprising, such as multimodality and skewness, and can vastly improve model fit relative to the original parametric family. Polya tree models are broadly applicable and easily programmed given existing MCMC schemes for fitting the original parametric model.

Our examples include Paraguayan monkey hunting and toenail fungus treatment. In the first of these examples, we find that a normal theory model works quite well, but that there is little price to be paid for the extra generality of fitting a Mixture of Polya trees.","Bayesian,Generalized linear mixed model,GLMM","GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,RANDOM DISTRIBUTIONS,ASYMPTOTIC-BEHAVIOR,DIRICHLET PROCESSES,BAYES,INFERENCE,REGRESSION,DENSITY","Christensen, Ronald@Univ New Mexico, Dept Math & Stat, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA::Hanson, Timothy@Univ Minnesota, Div Biostat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA::Jara, Alejandro@Univ Concepcion, Dept Stat, Concepcion, Chile","Christensen, Ronald@University of New Mexico::Hanson, Timothy@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities::Jara, Alejandro@Universidad de Concepcion","Hanson, Timothy@A-9127-2016","The consistency of posterior distributions in nonparametric problems+Barron, A; Schervish, MJ; Wasserman, L+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 1999::A new perspective on priors for generalized linear models+Bedrick, EJ; Christensen, R; Johnson, W+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1996::Bayesian and conditional frequentist testing of a parametric model versus nonparametric alternatives+Berger, JO; Guglielmi, A+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2001::EMPIRICAL BAYES ESTIMATION OF A BINOMIAL PARAMETER VIA MIXTURES OF DIRICHLET PROCESSES+BERRY, DA; CHRISTENSEN, R+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1979::FERGUSON DISTRIBUTIONS VIA POLYA URN SCHEMES+BLACKWELL, D; MACQUEEN, JB+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1973::Bayesian nonparametric meta-analysis using Polya tree mixture models+Branscum, Adam J.+BIOMETRICS+SEP 2008::Bayesian semiparametric ROC curve estimation and disease diagnosis+Branscum, Adam J.; Johnson, Wesley O.; Hanson, Timothy E.; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUN 15 2008::APPROXIMATE INFERENCE IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS+BRESLOW, NE; CLAYTON, DG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::EXPLAINING THE GIBBS SAMPLER+CASELLA, G; GEORGE, EI+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 1992::Testing Fisher, Neyman, Pearson, and Bayes+Christensen, R+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 2005::no title+Christensen, R.+Log-Linear Models and Logistic Regression+1997::A 12-week treatment for dermatophyte toe onychomycosis: Terbinafine 250 mg/day vs, itraconazole 200 mg/day - A double-blind comparative trial+DeBacker, M; DeKeyser, P; DeVroey, C; et al.+BRITISH JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY+JUN 1996::no title+DEY DK+PRACTICAL NONPARAMET+1998::Random distribution functions+Dubins, L.; Freedman, D.+Contributions to Probability Theory, Part 1+1967::Bayesian density regression+Dunson, David B.; Pillai, Natesh; Park, Ju-Hyun+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2007::ESTIMATING NORMAL MEANS WITH A DIRICHLET PROCESS PRIOR+ESCOBAR, MD+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1994::ASYMPTOTIC-BEHAVIOR OF BAYES ESTIMATES+FABIUS, J+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1964::PRIOR DISTRIBUTIONS ON SPACES OF PROBABILITY MEASURES+FERGUSON, TS+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1974::ON ASYMPTOTIC-BEHAVIOR OF BAYES ESTIMATES IN DISCRETE CASE+FREEDMAN, DA+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1963::PREDICTIVE APPROACH TO MODEL SELECTION+GEISSER, S; EDDY, WF+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1979::no title+Gelman, A.

Another advance concerns the drawing (at the outset) of the households themselves and involves random-digit dialing with atypical use of list-assisted sampling. A common element throughout is that one capitalizes on flexibility (not broadly available in usual survey settings) in choosing the frame, which specifies the population of persons from which both cases and controls come.","Bias,List-assisted sampling,Population-based case-control studies,Random-digit dialing,Respondent selection within households","EXACT LOGISTIC-REGRESSION,EXAMPLES","Potthoff, Richard F.@Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Canc Stat Ctr, Durham, NC 27705 USA::Halabi, Susan@Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Biostat & Bioinformat, Durham, NC 27705 USA::Schildkraut, Joellen M.@Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Community & Family Med, Durham, NC 27705 USA@Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Duke Comprehens Canc Ctr, Durham, NC 27705 USA::Newman, Beth@Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Publ Hlth, Inst Hlth & Biomed Innovat, Kelvin Grove, Qld 4059, Australia","Potthoff, Richard F.@Duke University::Halabi, Susan@Duke University::Schildkraut, Joellen M.@Duke University::Newman, Beth@Queensland University of Technology (QUT)",not exist,"A survey of exact inference for Contingency Tables+Agresti, A.+Statistical Science+1992::no title+Armitage, PBG; Matthews, JNS.+STAT METHODS MED RES+2002::Statistics in epidemiology: The case-control study+Breslow, NE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1996::BIAS IN LIST-ASSISTED TELEPHONE SAMPLES+BRICK, JM; WAKSBERG, J; KULP, D; et al.+PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY+SUM 1995::Comparison of telephone sampling and area sampling: Response rates and within-household coverage+Brogan, DJ; Denniston, MM; Liff, JM; et al.+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+JUN 1 2001::Commentary: Trade-offs in the development of a sample design for case-control studies+DiGaetano, R; Waksberg, J+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+APR 15 2002::no title+Dodge, Y.+The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms+2003::EFFECTS OF CLUSTER SAMPLING ON EPIDEMIOLOGIC ANALYSIS IN POPULATION-BASED CASE CONTROL STUDIES+GRAUBARD, BI; FEARS, TR; GAIL, MH+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1989::RANDOM DIGIT DIALING FOR CONTROL SELECTION - A REVIEW AND A CAUTION ON ITS USE IN STUDIES OF CHILDHOOD-CANCER+GREENBERG, ER+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+JAN 1990::RANDOM DIGIT DIALING IN SELECTING A POPULATION-BASED CONTROL-GROUP+HARTGE, P; BRINTON, LA; ROSENTHAL, JF; et al.+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+1984::no title+Hosmer, D; Lemeshow, S.+Applied logistic regression+2000::no title+Kelsey, Jennifer.+METHODS OBSERVATIONA+1996::A preliminary investigation of maximum likelihood logistic regression versus exact logistic regression+King, EN; Ryan, TP+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 2002::no title+Korn, E.

"Decision Analysis for the Evaluation of Diagnostic Tests, Prediction Models, and Molecular Markers",AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313008X370302,NOV 2008,11,58,"The traditional statistical approach to the evaluation of diagnostic tests, prediction models, and molecular markers is to assess their accuracy, using metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and the receiver-operating-characteristic curve. However, there is no obvious association between accuracy and clinical value: it is unclear, for example, just how accurate a test needs to be in order for it to be considered ""accurate enough"" to warrant its use in patient care. Decision analysis aims to assess the clinical value of a test by assigning weights to each possible consequence. These methods have been historically considered unattractive to the practicing. biostatistician because additional data from the literature, or subjective assessments from individual patients or clinicians, are needed in order to assign weights appropriately. Decision analytic methods are available that can reduce these additional requirements. These methods can provide insight into the consequences of using a test, model, or marker in clinical practice.","Decision support techniques,Outcome assessment,Prognosis",PROSTATE-CANCER,"Vickers, Andrew J.@Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, New York, NY 10065 USA","Vickers, Andrew J.@Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center","Vickers, Andrew@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1525-6503","no title+BAKER SG+AM STAT+2007::Assessing the benefits of testing for breast cancer susceptibility genes: a decision analysis.+Berry, D A; Parmigiani, G+Breast disease+1998-Apr::no title+Hunink, MGM; Glasziou, PP; lJE, Siege<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Weeks, JC; Pliskin, JS; Elstein, AS</span>.+Decision making in health and medicine: integrating evidence and values+2001::Systematic review: Gene expression profiling assays in early-stage breast cancer+Marchionni, Luigi; Wilson, Renee F.; Wolff, Antonio C.; et al.+ANNALS OF INTERNAL MEDICINE+MAR 4 2008::THE THRESHOLD APPROACH TO CLINICAL DECISION-MAKING+PAUKER, SG; KASSIRER, JP+NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE+1980::Use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) isoforms for the detection of prostate cancer in men with a PSA level of 2-10 ng/ml: Systematic review and meta-analysis+Roddam, AW; Duffy, MJ; Hamdy, FC; et al.+EUROPEAN UROLOGY+SEP 2005::The story of the European Randomized study of screening for prostate cancer+Schroder, FH; Denis, LJ; Roobol, M+BJU INTERNATIONAL+DEC 2003::TOWARD AN OPTIMAL ALGORITHM FOR OVARIAN-CANCER SCREENING WITH LONGITUDINAL TUMOR-MARKERS+SKATES, SJ; XU, FJ; YU, YH; et al.+CANCER+NOV 15 1995::Validity of prognostic models: when is a model clinically useful?+Vergouwe, Yvonne; Steyerberg, Ewout W; Eijkemans, Marinus J C; et al.+Seminars in urologic oncology+2002-May::Systematic review of statistical methods used in molecular marker studies in cancer+Vickers, Andrew J.; Jang, Kwang; Sargent, Daniel; et al.+CANCER+APR 15 2008::Decision curve analysis: A novel method for evaluating prediction models+Vickers, Andrew J.; Elkin, Elena B.+MEDICAL DECISION MAKING+NOV-DEC 2006"

Displaying Uncertainty With Shading,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313008X370843,NOV 2008,29,28,"A new technique is presented for illustrating several probability distributions on the same axes. The density strip is a shaded monochrome strip whose darkness at a point is proportional to the probability density of the quantity at that point. These are ideal for comparing distributions arising from parameter estimation, such as posterior distributions from Bayesian multiple regression or meta-analysis. Such distributions are more commonly illustrated as a point and line representing point and interval estimates. This may give the false perception that all points within the line are equally likely, and that points outside the line are impossible. The density strip represents the entire distribution in one dimension, giving a fuller description of the uncertainty surrounding the quantity. The strips fade gradually to white in the tails of a typical distribution, in contrast with line plots and strips whose thickness is proportional to the density, which terminate at a clear limit. This discourages casual significance testing based on comparing an arbitrary point in the tail of the distribution to a threshold. Shaded strips can also be generalized to shaded regions, which illustrate the uncertainty surrounding a continuously varying unknown quantity, such as a survival curve or a forecast from a time series.","Color,Distribution,Forecasting,Density,Meta-analysis,Multiple regression",PLOTS,"Jackson, Christopher H.@Inst Publ Hlth, MRC Biostat Unit, Cambridge, England","Jackson, Christopher H.@MRC Biostatistics Unit@University of Cambridge",not exist,"no title+*BANK ENGL+INFL RE NOV+2007::Raindrop plots: A new way to display collections of likelihoods and distributions+Barrowman, NJ; Myers, RA+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+NOV 2003::Color use guidelines for mapping+Brewer, CA.+Visualization in modern cartography+1994::no title+Cleveland, W.+The elements of graphing data+1985::no title+Cleveland, W.

Agreement with kurtosis orderings based on the CDFs, and a strong correlation between the total peak and tails area with quantile kurtosis, were found for the distributions examined.

We use ANOVA because it is arguably one of the most widely used statistical models in practice and because its Bayesian treatment has interesting ties to the classical ANOVA, creating a smooth transition for students in a frequentist-based course to be introduced to Bayesian ideas. We discuss the limitations of this seminar in the context of our assumptions of what the students can or cannot do.

These students often have weak backgrounds in mathematical statistics and a predisposition against likelihood-based methods stemming from prior exposure to econometrics.

The evolution of the course followed shifts in Bayesian statistics in the broader community, as software became available that made it easier to implement Bayesian methods. In addition to the shift from theory to hands-on computation, there was a shift from using noninformative priors as we learned how to elicit realistic priors from subject-matter experts.

The problem is recast in terms of a hierarchical model. This offers an alternative explanation of the paradox but also reveals a disturbing dependence of inference on prior specification. The example may also be used to deepen students' understanding of the implications of using conjugate nonhierarchical priors in Bayesian analysis. To illustrate, some simulations are presented.","Bayesian inference,hierarchical models,prior distributions,selection paradox","STATISTICAL-THEORY,PERSPECTIVE,VAGUENESS,PRECISE,WINBUGS","Senn, Stephen@Univ Glasgow, Dept Stat, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland","Senn, Stephen@University of Glasgow","Senn, Stephen@A-8101-2008::Senn, Stephen@B-2903-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7558-8473","Bayesian statistics in medicine: A 25 year review+Ashby, Deborah+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+NOV 15 2006::A Comment on D.

An example is shown where E(Y-n vertical bar X) = E(Y-n) and E(X-n vertical bar Y)') = E(X-n) for n = 1, 2.... and yet X and Y are not stochastically independent. The bivariate distribution is constructed using a well-known example in which the distribution of a random variable is not uniquely determined by its sequence of moments. Other similar families of distributions with identical moments can be used to display such a pair of random variables. It is interesting to note in class that even such a degree of dissociation between the moments of X and Y does not imply stochastic independence.","independence,indeterminate distributions,moments",COMOVEMENT,"de Paula, Aureo@Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","de Paula, Aureo@University of Pennsylvania",not exist,"no title+ARNOLD BC+CONDITIONALLY SPECIF+1992::Comovement+Barberis, N; Shleifer, A; Wurgler, J+JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS+FEB 2005::THE CUBE OF A NORMAL-DISTRIBUTION IS INDETERMINATE+BERG, C+ANNALS OF PROBABILITY+APR 1988::no title+Billingsley, P.+Probability and measure+1995::no title+Casella, G; Berger, R.+Statistical Inference+2001::INVESTMENT AND THE VALUATION OF FIRMS WHEN THERE IS AN OPTION TO SHUT DOWN+MCDONALD, RL; SIEGEL, DR+INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC REVIEW+1985::THE COMOVEMENT OF STOCK-PRICES+PINDYCK, RS; ROTEMBERG, JJ+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+NOV 1993::Recherches sur les fractions continues+Stieltjes, T.+OEuvres completes de Thomas Jan Stieltjes+1918::Recherches sur les fractions continues+Stieltjes, T.

Recently, the spotlight has focused on one method, propensity score matching (PSM), as the suggested approach for evaluating employment and education programs. We present a case study of our experience using PSM, under seemingly ideal circumstances, for the evaluation of the State Partnership Initiative employment promotion program. Despite ideal conditions and the passing of statistical tests suggesting that the matching procedure had worked, we find that PSM produced incorrect impact estimates when compared with a randomized design.

Smoothed histograms for frequency data on irregular intervals,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313008X335581,AUG 2008,17,5,"Frequency tables are often constructed on intervals of irregular width. When plotted as bar charts, the underlying true density information may be quite distorted. The majority of introductory statistics texts recommend tabulating data into intervals of equal width, but seldom caution the consequences of failing to do so. An occasional introductory text correctly emphasizes that area rather than frequency should be plotted. Nevertheless, the correctly scaled density figure is often visually less informative than one might expect, with wide bins at constant height. In many cases, the rightmost bin interval has no well-defined end-point, making its depiction somewhat arbitrary.

Delta plots and coherent distribution ordering,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313008X333493,AUG 2008,8,20,"Social scientists often compare subclasses of populations or manipulatons. For example, in comparing task-completion times across two levels of a manipulations, if one group has faster overall mean response, it is natural to ask if the fastest 10% of the first group has a faster mean than the fastest 10% of the second group, and so on. Delta plots, a type of quantile-quantile residual plot used by psychologists, shed light on these comparisons and motivate new notions of stochastic ordering. If all percentile classes have faster mean in one group than in the other, we say that there is coherent mean ordering and that one group stochastically dominates the other in mean. A related notion of coherent variance ordering can be defined similarly. Violations of coherent orderings of means or variances are diagnostic signatures of complex effects and suggest further avenues of study. In this note, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for stochastic dominance in mean and variance. We show that stochastic mean dominance is exactly equivalent to the usual stochastic dominance and stochastic variance dominance is equivalent to ordering of the first derivative of the quantile functions.","delta plot,Q-Q plot,stochastic dominance",,"Speckman, Paul L.@Univ Missouri, Dept Stat, Columbia, MO 65211 USA::Rouder, Jeffrey N.@Unknow::Morey, Richard D.@Univ Groningen, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands::Pratte, Michael S.@Unknow","Speckman, Paul L.@University of Missouri Columbia@University of Missouri System::Rouder, Jeffrey N.@Unknow::Morey, Richard D.@University of Groningen::Pratte, Michael S.@Unknow","Morey, Richard@B-1945-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9220-3179::Rouder, Jeffrey@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2023-3891","Bootstrap tests for distributional treatment effects in instrumental variable models+Abadie, A+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2002::Optimal rules for ordering uncertain prospects+Bawa, V.

Much of this new research falls into one of two broad categories: kernel methods and ensemble methods. In this expository article, I discuss the main ideas behind these two types of methods, namely how to transform linear algorithms into nonlinear ones by using kernel functions, and how to make predictions with an ensemble or a collection of models rather than a single model. I also share my personal perspectives on how these ideas have influenced and shaped my own research. In particular, I present two recent algorithms that I have invented with my collaborators: LAGO, a fast kernel algorithm for unbalanced classification and rare target detection; and Darwinian evolution in parallel universes, an ensemble method for variable selection.","AdaBoost,kernel PCA,LAGO,parallel evolution,random forest,SVM",,"Zhu, M.@Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada","Zhu, M.@University of Waterloo",not exist,"Information theory as an extension of the maximum likelihood principle+Akaike, H.+2 INT S INF THEOR+1973::Random forests+Breiman, L+MACHINE LEARNING+OCT 2001::Bagging predictors+Breiman, L+MACHINE LEARNING+AUG 1996::no title+Cristianini, N.; Shawe- Taylor, J.+An introduction to support vector machines: and other kernel- based learning methods+2000::Experiments with a new boosting algorithm+Freund, Y.; Schapire, R.E.+Machine Learning.

Survival analysis: A primer,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313008X298439,MAY 2008,49,9,"In this article, I will discuss life tables and Kaplan-Meier estimators, which are similar to life tables. Then I turn to proportional-hazards models, aka ""Cox models."" Along the way, I will look at the efficacy of screening for lung cancer, the impact of negative religious feelings on survival, and the efficacy of hormone replacement therapy.

What conclusions should be drawn about statistical practice? Proportional-hazards models are frequently used to analyze data from randomized controlled trials. This is a mistake. Randomization does not justify the models, which are rarely informative. Simpler analytic methods should be used first.

With observational studies, the models would help us disentangle causal relations if the assumptions behind the models could be justified. Justifying those assumptions, however, is fraught with difficulty.","Cox model,event history analysis,Kaplan-Meier estimator,life tables,proportional hazards","HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY,LUNG-CANCER,POSTMENOPAUSAL ESTROGEN,MODEL,PREVENTION,REGRESSION,PROGESTIN,MORTALITY,DISEASE","Freedman, David A.@Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Freedman, David A.@University of California Berkeley@University of California System",not exist,"NONPARAMETRIC INFERENCE FOR A FAMILY OF COUNTING PROCESSES+AALEN, O+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1978::The revised CONSORT statement for reporting randomized trials: Explanation and elaboration+Altman, DG; Schulz, KF; Moher, D; et al.+ANNALS OF INTERNAL MEDICINE+APR 17 2001::no title+Andersen, P.

Using calibration to improve rounding in imputation,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313008X300912,MAY 2008,17,28,"Since the 1990s, imputation methods have become increasingly accessible in standard software that typically assume a multivariate normal (MVN) distribution for incompletely observed variables. When these variables are not normally distributed but rather categorical (binary or ordinal), practitioners are often advised to round the MVN imputations to the nearest integer, but this simple procedure can lead to biased estimates. We propose practical rounding rules to be used with the existing imputation methods (e.g., under MVN) to obtain usable imputations with small biases for estimation of means and correlations. The rounding rules are calibrated in the sense that values reimputed for observed data have distributions similar to those of the observed data. Calibration in this sense is a form of posterior predictive check that can be used to evaluate any imputation procedure. It is readily implemented by duplicating the data and comparing the distributions of observed and imputed data. We calculate asymptotic biases of marginal means and slope coefficients under plausible models to assess the performance of our method.","categorical data imputation,missing data,missing data software,multiple imputation,multivariate normal,posterior predictive check,rounding","MULTIPLE IMPUTATION,MISSING-DATA","Yucel, Recai M.@SUNY Albany, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Rensselaer, NY 12144 USA::He, Yulei@Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Hlth Care Policy, Boston, MA 02115 USA::Zaslavsky, Alan M.@Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Hlth Care Policy, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Yucel, Recai M.@State University of New York (SUNY) Albany@State University of New York (SUNY) System::He, Yulei@Harvard University::Zaslavsky, Alan M.@Harvard University",not exist,"no title+BERNAARDS CA+STAT MED+2006::no title+Gelman, A; Carlin, JB; Sterns, HS<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Rubin, DB</span>.+Bayesian Data Analysis+2004::Multiple imputation for model checking: Completed-data plots with missing and latent data+Gelman, A; Van Mechelen, I; Verbeke, G; et al.+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2005::Posterior predictive assessment of model fitness via realized discrepancies+Gelman, A; Meng, XL; Stern, H+STATISTICA SINICA+OCT 1996::Tukey's gh distribution for multiple imputation+He, Yulei; Raghunathan, Trivellore E.+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 2006::A potential for bias when rounding in multiple imputation+Horton, NJ; Lipsitz, SR; Parzen, M+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+NOV 2003::Multiple imputation for incomplete data with semicontinuous variables+Javaras, KN; Van Dyk, DA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2003::no title+Little, R.

Is the overtime period in an NHL game long enough?

We consider the effects of extending the overtime period in a regular season game beyond its current length of five minutes. The rationale for this change is that more games would be decided on the basis of four-on-four play rather than on a shootout. In order to make this assessment, we must estimate the parameter of the exponential distribution, We used data from the 281 NHL games that went to over-time during the 2005-2006 season. Of these, more than half went to a shootout and hence these potential observations of the time to a goal are censored and must be taken into account in the estimation. For more advanced students, we offer the mechanics of a likelihood ratio test to confirm that four-on-four play in overtime is a much different game than five-on-five in regulation play.","likelihood estimates,statistics in sports","GOALIE,MORRISON,HOCKEY","Brimberg, Jack@Royal Mil Coll Canada, Kingston, ON K7K 5L0, Canada::Hurley, W.

This article proposes a didactic method that stimulates students to self-explain the study material. This stimulus to self-explanation is directed, because the instructor decides which particular links and relationships between concepts the student should explore. The method is composed of two major steps: having the students identify the propositions that underlie the statistical theory, and then having them manipulate these propositions by constructing arguments showing a given statement to be either true or false. A practical way of implementing the method in a large-scale introductory statistics course is briefly described.","propositional knowledge,propositional manipulation,stimulating self-explanation",,"Broers, Nick J.@Maastricht Univ, Dept Methodol & Stat, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands","Broers, Nick J.@Maastricht University",not exist,"An effective metacognitive strategy: learning by doing and explaining with a computer-based Cognitive Tutor+Aleven, VAWMM; Koedinger, KR+COGNITIVE SCIENCE+MAR-APR 2002::Learning from examples via self-explanations+Bassok, M.; Chi, M.

Predicting presidential and other multistage election outcomes using state-level pre-election polls,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313008X267820,FEB 2008,12,4,"Although much of the media attention during presidential election years focuses on polls tracking popular support for the major candidates, the complicated role played by the Electoral College in this multistage election process must be accounted for in order to address the issue of winning the presidency. State-level pre-election polls are used in a manner that allows the structure of multistage election processes to be addressed directly. We consider frequentist and Bayesian approaches for predicting election outcomes and discuss ways to incorporate such analyses in a course project suitable for undergraduates or graduate students studying statistics. Using state-level pre-election polling data, we consider the U.S. presidential election of 2004 and we also apply this approach to predict the control of the U.S. Senate in 2006. This class exercise has proved to be a useful ""capstone project"" which requires students to address a complicated problem by synthesizing multiple sources of available data and applying a combination of statistical methods. Using simulation-based approaches for addressing the multistage nature of presidential elections and control-of-Congress processes can be valuable and instructive for students of statistics and political science, and can be beneficial to the media in providing consumers with political news.","capstone project,electoral college,news media,politics,simulation,US president","POINT NULL HYPOTHESIS,P-VALUES,IRRECONCILABILITY,VOTE","Christensen, William F.@Brigham Young Univ, Dept Stat, Provo, UT 84602 USA::Florence, Lindsay W.@Brigham Young Univ, Dept Stat, Provo, UT 84602 USA","Christensen, William F.@Brigham Young University::Florence, Lindsay W.@Brigham Young University","Christensen, William@F-7216-2013","TESTING A POINT NULL HYPOTHESIS - THE IRRECONCILABILITY OF P-VALUES AND EVIDENCE+BERGER, JO; SELLKE, T+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1987::Forecasting presidential elections using history and polls+Brown, LB; Chappell, HW+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+APR 1999::FORECASTING THE PRESIDENTIAL VOTE IN THE STATES+CAMPBELL, JE+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE+MAY 1992::Polls and votes - The trial-heat presidential election forecasting model, certainty, and political campaigns+Campbell, JE+AMERICAN POLITICS QUARTERLY+OCT 1996::TRIAL-HEAT FORECASTS OF THE PRESIDENTIAL VOTE+CAMPBELL, JE; WINK, KA+AMERICAN POLITICS QUARTERLY+JUL 1990::RECONCILING BAYESIAN AND FREQUENTIST EVIDENCE IN THE ONE-SIDED TESTING PROBLEM+CASELLA, G; BERGER, RL+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1987::State-level public opinion polls as predictors of presidential election results - The 1996 race+Cohen, JE+AMERICAN POLITICS QUARTERLY+APR 1998::no title+CURL J+WASHINGTON TIME 1028+2004::Using state polls to forecast presidential election outcomes in the American states+Holbrook, TM; DeSart, JA+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+APR 1999::TESTING A POINT NULL HYPOTHESIS - THE IRRECONCILABILITY OF P-VALUES AND EVIDENCE - COMMENT+MORRIS, CN+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1987::Bayesian multilevel estimation with poststratification: State-level estimates from national polls+Park, DK; Gelman, A; Bafumi, J+POLITICAL ANALYSIS+FAL 2004::no title+SRICAC P+WASHINGTON POST 0822+2004"

Percentage-based audits can also be ineffective, since close contests may require auditing a large fraction of the total to provide confidence in the outcome. We present a plausible statistical framework that we have used in advising state and local election officials and legislators.

The role of likelihood in interval estimation,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313008X271465,FEB 2008,25,10,"It is common practice to treat coverage probability as the only requirement for interval estimation. This allows the use of one-sided confidence intervals. These achieve their coverage probabilities by including parameter values with relative likelihood approaching 0. This violates the law of likelihood, a post-data concept of statistical evidence introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1921. Coverage probability and the law of likelihood are both necessary for interval estimation, but neither is sufficient. When combined, they minimize the possibility of users with the same data, model, and confidence level getting different answers.","coverage probability,confidence,one-sided inference,statistical evidence",,"Boyles, Russell A.@Westview Analyt, Lake Oswego, OR 97034 USA","Boyles, Russell A.@Unknow",not exist,"no title+Azzalini, A.+Statistical Inference: Based on the Likelihood+1996::no title+BARNARD GA+J AM STAT ASSOC+1947::STATISTICAL INFERENCE+BARNARD, GA+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1949::no title+BARNARD GA+P 5 BERK S+1965::no title+Barndorff-Nielson, OE; Cox, DR.+Asymptotic Techniques for Use in Statistics+1989::no title+BARNDORFFNIELSO.OE+INFERENCE ASYMPTOTIC+1994::no title+Berger, JO; Wolpert, RL.+The likelihood principle+1984::ON FOUNDATIONS OF STATISTICAL-INFERENCE+BIRNBAUM, A+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1962::no title+Brazzale, A.

Sample size determination for binomial proportion intervals: An alternative perspective motivated by a confidence legal case,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313008X271474,FEB 2008,7,2,"This article revisits the problem of determining sample size for interval estimation of a binomial proportion. It is motivated by the author's experience as an expert witness in a legal case. The legal case involves a class action suit against a large service provider for alleged over-collection of special service fees. We discuss how: (1) focusing on relative error of the binomial outcome instead of absolute error of the Bernoulli probability p can have a dramatic effect on sample size recommendations, and (2) a year-by-year analysis may differ from a single-year analysis. We also discuss the challenges in presenting such statistical results to nonstatisticians, and propose simplifications to enhance communicability.","estimator,margin of error,probability sample,sampling,simple random sample",,"Afshartous, David@Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, Div Clin Pharmacol, Miami, FL 33136 USA","Afshartous, David@University of Miami",not exist,"Approximate is better than ""exact"" for interval estimation of binomial proportions+Agresti, A; Coull, BA+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1998::Sampling assumptions in introductory statistics classes+Alf, Cherie; Lohr, Sharon+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+FEB 2007::BINOMIAL CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS+BLYTH, CR; STILL, HA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1983::Interval estimation for a binomial proportion - Comment - Rejoinder+Brown, LD; Cai, TT; DasGupta, A; et al.+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 2001::no title+Cochran, W.

Confidence intervals for a discrete population median,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313008X269738,FEB 2008,19,2,"In this article, we consider the problem of constructing confidence intervals for a population median when the underlying population is discrete. We describe seven methods of assigning confidence levels to order statistic based confidence intervals, all of which are easy to implement. A simulation study shows that, with discrete populations, it is possible to obtain consistently more accurate confidence levels and shorter intervals compared to the ones reported by the classical method which is implemented in commercial software. More precisely, the best results are obtained by inverting a two-tailed sign test that properly takes into account tied observations. Some real data examples illustrate the use of these confidence intervals.","confidence level,discrete distribution,maximum likelihood,multinomial distribution,sign test,tied observations","SIGN TEST,ORDER-STATISTICS,TIES,QUANTILES","Larocque, Denis@HEC Montreal, Dept Management Sci, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada::Randles, Ronald H.@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Larocque, Denis@University of Montreal@HEC Montreal::Randles, Ronald H.@State University System of Florida@University of Florida",not exist,"Approximate is better than ""exact"" for interval estimation of binomial proportions+Agresti, A; Coull, BA+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1998::Versions of the sign test in the presence of ties+Coakley, CW; Heise, MA+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1996::no title+Daniels, WW.+Applied Nonparametric Statistics+1990::no title+DOORNIK, J.A.+Object-Oriented Matrix Programming Using Ox (Version 3.1)+2002::ANOTHER LOOK AT THE SIGN TEST WHEN TIES ARE PRESENT - PROBLEM OF CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS+EMERSON, JD; SIMON, GA+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+1979::The quality of information on monitoring for haematological adverse drug reactions+Ferner, RE; Coleman, J; Pirmohamed, M; et al.+BRITISH JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY+OCT 2005::The negative binomial distribution+Fisher, RA+ANNALS OF EUGENICS+1941::Use of the sign test for the median in the presence of ties+Fong, DYT; Kwan, CW; Lam, KF; et al.+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+NOV 2003::no title+Hand, D.

"A comparison of Bayes-Laplace, Jeffreys, and other priors: The case of zero events",AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313008X267839,FEB 2008,28,18,"Beta distributions with both parameters equal to 0, 1/2 or 1 are the usual choices for ""noninformative"" priors for Bayesian estimation of the binomial parameter. However, as illustrated by two examples from the Bayesian literature, care needs to be taken with parameter values below 1, both for noninformative and informative priors, as such priors concentrate their mass close to 0 and/or 1 and can suppress the importance of the observed data. These examples concern the case of no successes (or failures) and illustrate the informativeness of the Jeffreys prior usually recommended as the ""consensus prior."" In particular, the second example suggests that when the binomial param- eter is known to be very small, an informative prior from the beta(1, b) family (b > 1) seems appropriate, while a beta(a, b) with a < 1 can be too informative. It is thus argued that sensitivity analysis of an informative prior should be based on a consensus posterior corresponding to the Bayes-Laplace prior rather than the Jeffreys prior.","Bayesian inference,binomial distribution,noninformative priors,prior families","BINOMIAL PARAMETER,CONFIDENCE,INFERENCE,DISTRIBUTIONS,INTERVAL,LIMITS","Tuyl, Frank@Hunter New England Populat Hlth, Newcastle, NSW, Australia::Gerlach, Richard@Univ Sydney, Fac Econ & Business, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia::Mengersen, Kerrie@Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Math Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia","Tuyl, Frank@Unknow::Gerlach, Richard@University of Sydney::Mengersen, Kerrie@Queensland University of Technology (QUT)",not exist,"An essay towards solving a problem in the doctrine of chances+Bayes, T.+Phil Trans+1763::no title+Berger, J.+Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis+1985::The Case for Objective Bayesian Analysis+Berger, James+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2006::Integrated likelihood methods for eliminating nuisance parameters+Berger, JO; Liseo, B; Wolpert, RL+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+FEB 1999::no title+BERNARDO JM+BAYESIAN THINKING MO+2005::REFERENCE POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTIONS FOR BAYESIAN-INFERENCE+BERNARDO, JM+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1979::An introduction to Bayesian reference analysis: inference on the ratio of multinomial parameters+Bernardo, JM; Ramon, JM+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES D-THE STATISTICIAN+1998::no title+Berry, D.A.+Statistics: A Bayesian Perspective+1996::APPROXIMATE BINOMIAL CONFIDENCE-LIMITS+BLYTH, CR+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1986::no title+BOX, G.

We remind readers of these aspects, and rework his calculations using 21st century computing power.

"Understanding and Addressing the Unbounded ""Likelihood"" Problem",AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2014.1003968,2015,34,0,"The joint probability density function, evaluated at the observed data, is commonly used as the likelihood function to compute maximum likelihood estimates. For some models, however, there exist paths in the parameter space along which this density-approximation likelihood goes to infinity and maximum likelihood estimation breaks down. In all applications, however, observed data are really discrete due to the round-off or grouping error of measurements. The ""correct likelihood"" based on interval censoring can eliminate the problem of an unbounded likelihood. This article categorizes the models leading to unbounded likelihoods into three groups and illustrates the density-approximation breakdown with specific examples. Although it is usually possible to infer how given data were rounded, when this is not possible, one must choose the width for interval censoring, so we study the effect of the round-off on estimation. We also give sufficient conditions for the joint density to provide the same maximum likelihood estimate as the correct likelihood, as the round-off error goes to zero.","Density approximation,Interval censoring,Maximum likelihood,Round-off error,Unbounded likelihood","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,SWITCHING REGRESSIONS,TRANSFORMATIONS,DISTRIBUTIONS,PARAMETERS,MIXTURE","Liu, Shiyao@Genentech Inc, Genentech Med Affairs, Dept Biostat, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA::Wu, Huaiqing@Iowa State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Stat, Ames, IA 50011 USA::Meeker, William Q.@Iowa State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Stat, Ames, IA 50011 USA","Liu, Shiyao@Genentech@Roche Holding::Wu, Huaiqing@Iowa State University::Meeker, William Q.@Iowa State University",not exist,"no title+Atkinson, A.+Plots, Transformations, and Regression: An Introduction to Graphical Methods of Diagnostic Regression Analysis+1985::GROUPED LIKELIHOOD FOR THE SHIFTED POWER TRANSFORMATION+ATKINSON, AC; PERICCHI, LR; SMITH, RL+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1991::The Use of the Likelihood Function in Statistical Practice+Barnard, G.

A Statistical Framework for Hypothesis Testing in Real Data Comparison Studies,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2015.1005128,2015,38,11,"In computational sciences, including computational statistics, machine learning, and bioinformatics, it is often claimed in articles presenting new supervised learning methods that the new method performs better than existing methods on real data, for instance in terms of error rate. However, these claims are often not based on proper statistical tests and, even if such tests are performed, the tested hypothesis is not clearly defined and poor attention is devoted to the Type I and Type II errors. In the present article, we aim to fill this gap by providing a proper statistical framework for hypothesis tests that compare the performances of supervised learning methods based on several real datasets with unknown underlying distributions. After giving a statistical interpretation of ad hoc tests commonly performed by computational researchers, we devote special attention to power issues and outline a simple method of determining the number of datasets to be included in a comparison study to reach an adequate power. These methods are illustrated through three comparison studies from the literature and an exemplary benchmarking study using gene expression microarray data.

What Your Future Doctor Should Know About Statistics: Must-Include Topics for Introductory Undergraduate Biostatistics,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2015.1048903,2015,51,1,"The increased emphasis on evidence-based medicine creates a greater need for educating future physicians in the general domain of quantitative reasoning, probability, and statistics. Reflecting this trend, more medical schools now require applicants to have taken an undergraduate course in introductory statistics. Given the breadth of statistical applications, we should cover in that course certain essential topics that may not be covered in the more general introductory statistics course. In selecting and presenting such topics, we should bear in mind that doctors also need to communicate probabilistic concepts of risks and benefits to patients who are increasingly expected to be active participants in their own health care choices despite having no training in medicine or statistics. It is also important that interesting and relevant examples accompany the presentation, because the examples (rather than the details) are what students tend to retain years later. Here, we present a list of topics we cover in the introductory biostatistics course that may not be covered in the general introductory course. We also provide some of our favorite examples for discussing these topics.","Biostatistics education,Premedical students,Statistical literacy,Statistics education","EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICINE,CONTROLLED TRIALS,DIAGNOSTIC-TESTS,HORMONE-THERAPY,WOMENS HEALTH,UNITED-STATES,BENEFITS,DISEASE,MAMMOGRAPHY,RISKS","Baldi, Brigitte@Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Stat, Irvine, CA 92697 USA::Utts, Jessica@Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Stat, Irvine, CA 92697 USA","Baldi, Brigitte@University of California Irvine@University of California System::Utts, Jessica@University of California Irvine@University of California System",not exist,"no title+no author+Medical School Admissions Requirements+2015::no title+no author+Scientific Foundations for Future Physicians+2009::no title+no author+A Patient-Doctor Decision: Should You Get a PSA Test?+2003::Retraction--Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children.+[Anonymous]+Lancet (London, England)+2010-Feb-06::Combating Domestic Violence: One Size Doesn't Fit All+[Anonymous].+NPR+Oct. 21,  2013::Bangladesh top court acquits Khaleda in graft case+[Anonymous].+Reuters+30 July 2009::Trends in Androgen Prescribing in the United States, 2001 to 2011+Baillargeon, Jacques; Urban, Randall J.; Ottenbacher, Kenneth J.; et al.+JAMA INTERNAL MEDICINE+AUG 12 2013::Testosterone Therapy in Men with Androgen Deficiency Syndromes: An Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline+Bhasin, Shalender; Cunningham, Glenn R.; Hayes, Frances J.; et al.+JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY &amp; METABOLISM+JUN 2010::Low testosterone could kill you+Bunyavanich, S.+ABC News+June 6 2007::Screening for Breast Cancer: US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement+Calonge, Ned; Petitti, Diana B.; DeWitt, Thomas G.; et al.+ANNALS OF INTERNAL MEDICINE+NOV 17 2009::Early Detection of Prostate Cancer: AUA Guideline+Carter, H.

Are Nonprofit Antipoverty Organizations Located Where They Are Needed? A Spatial Analysis of the Greater Hartford Region,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2014.955211,OCT 2 2014,49,2,"The geographic distribution of nonprofit antipoverty organizations has important implications for economic development, social services, public health, and policy efforts. With counts of antipoverty nonprofits at the census tract level in Greater Hartford, Connecticut, we examine whether these organizations are located in areas with high levels of poverty with a spatial zero-inflated-Poisson model. Covariates that measure need, resources, urban structure, and demographic characteristics are incorporated into both the zero-inflation component and the Poisson component of the model. Variation not explained by the covariates is captured by the combination of a spatial random effect and an unstructured random effect. Statistical inferences are done within the Bayesian framework. Model comparison with the conditional predictive ordinate suggests that the random effects and the zero-inflation are both important components in fitting the data. All three need measures-proportion of people below the poverty line, unemployment rate, and rental occupancy-are found to have significantly positive effect on the mean of the count, providing evidence that antipoverty nonprofits tend to locate where they are needed. The dataset and R/OpenBUGS code are available in supplementary materials online.","Zero-inflated Poisson,Intrinsic conditional autoregressive,Spatial random effect","PRIOR DISTRIBUTIONS,MODELS,REGRESSION,GEOGRAPHY,ERRORS,NGOS","Yan, Jun@Univ Connecticut, Dept Stat, Ctr Hlth, Publ Hlth Res Inst, Storrs, CT 06269 USA@Univ Connecticut, Ctr Environm Sci & Engn, Storrs, CT 06269 USA::Guo, Chao@Univ Penn, Sch Social Policy& Practice, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA::Paarlberg, Laurie E.@Texas A&M Univ, Bush Sch Govt & Publ Serv, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Yan, Jun@University of Connecticut::Guo, Chao@University of Pennsylvania::Paarlberg, Laurie E.@Texas A&M University System@Texas A&M University College Station","Paarlberg, Laurie@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2804-2459","Zero-inflated models with application to spatial count data+Agarwal, DK; Gelfand, AE; Citron-Pousty, S+ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL STATISTICS+DEC 2002::no title+Allard, S.

Reference Class Forecasting: Resolving Its Challenge to Statistical Modeling,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2014.937544,OCT 2 2014,22,0,"Statisticians generally consider statistical modeling superior (or at least a useful supplement) to experience-based intuition for estimating the outputs of a complex system. But recent psychological research has led to an enhancement of experience-based intuition known as reference class forecasting. The reference class forecasting approach has been championed as a superior alternative to statistical modeling and is already well-regarded in the planning community. This presents a challenge to statistical modeling. To address this challenge, this article uses a Bayesian approach for combining the reference class forecast and the model-based forecast. The Bayesian prior is informed by the reference class information. A likelihood function was constructed to reflect the model's information. This approach was used to estimate healthcare costs under a voluntary employee benefit association (VEBA). The resulting Bayesian posterior forecast had lower variance (and lower forecast error) than either the model-based forecast or the reference-class forecast.","Applications and case studies,Computer experiments,Bayesian methods,Probability,Inference,Healthcare",EMPIRICAL SIMILARITY,"Bordley, Robert F.@Booz Allen Hamilton, Inst Operat Res & Management Sci, Troy, MI 48094 USA@Univ Michigan, Amer Stat Assoc, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Bordley, Robert F.@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan",not exist,"Expected shortfall: A natural coherent alternative to value-at-risk+Acerbi, C.; Tasche, D.+Economic Notes, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena+2002::Applying Bayesian ideas in simulation+Andradottir, S; Bier, VM+SIMULATION PRACTICE AND THEORY+SEP 15 2000::From Nobel Prize to Project Management: Getting Risks Right+[Anonymous].+Project Management Journal+2006::Probabilities as similarity-weighted frequencies+Billot, A; Gilboa, I; Samet, D; et al.+ECONOMETRICA+JUL 2005::no title+de Rocquigny, E.+Modelling Under Risk and Uncertainty: An Introduction to Statistical, Phenomenological and Computational Methods+2012::Empirical similarity+Gilboa, Itzhak; Lieberman, Offer; Schmeidler, David+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+AUG 2006::Humanizing Policy Analysis: Confronting the Paradox in Energy Modeling+Greenberger, M.+Validation and Assessment of Energy Models+1981::Maps of Bounded Rationality: A Perspective on Intuitive Judgment and Choice+Kahneman, D.+MAPS BOUNDED RATIONA+2002::The use of Plackett-Burman designs to construct split-plot designs+Kulahci, M; Bisgaard, S+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 2005::ASYMPTOTIC THEORY FOR EMPIRICAL SIMILARITY MODELS+Lieberman, Offer+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+AUG 2010::Eliminating Bias Through Reference-Class Forecasting and Corporate Governance+Lovallo, D.+Concept Papers+2007::no title+Lovallo, D.; Kahneman, D.+Delusions of Success: How Optimism Bias Undermines Executive Decisions+2003::no title+Lutz, R.+Car Guys vs. Bean Counters: The Battle for the Soul of American Business+2011::no title+Morgan, G.; Henrion, M.+Uncertainty: A Guide to Dealing with Uncertainty in Quantitative Risk and Policy Analysis+1990::An illustration of the sample space definition of simulation and variance reduction+Nelson, B.L.+Transactions of the Society for Computer Simulation+Sept. 1985::DECOMPOSITION OF SOME WELL-KNOWN VARIANCE REDUCTION TECHNIQUES+NELSON, BL; SCHMEISER, BW+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+1986::no title+O'Connor, B.+Most Call VEBA a Good Deal, Detroit News.+September 27 2007::no title+Press, J.+Subjective and Objective Bayesian Statistics+1992::Simulation Experiments+Schmeiser, B.+HDB OPERATIONS RES M+1990::no title+Stiglitz, J.+Information and the Change in the Paradigm of Economics+2001::Managing structural uncertainty in health economic decision models: a discrepancy approach+Strong, Mark; Oakley, Jeremy E.; Chilcott, Jim+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2012::no title+Wand, P.; Jones, C.+Kernel smoothing+1995"
An Introduction to Practical Sequential Inferences via Single-Arm Binary Response Studies Using the binseqtest R Package,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2014.951126,OCT 2 2014,22,2,"We review sequential designs, including group sequential and two-stage designs, for testing or estimating a single binary parameter. We use this simple case to introduce ideas common to many sequential designs, which in this case can be explained without explicitly using stochastic processes. We focus on methods provided by our newly developed R package, binseqtest, which exactly bound the Type I error rate of tests and exactly maintain proper coverage of confidence intervals. Within this framework, we review some allowable practical adaptations of the sequential design. We explore issues such as the following: How should the design be modified if no assessment was made at one of the planned sequential stopping times? How should the parameter be estimated if the study needs to be stopped early? What reasons for stopping early are allowed?

Dissonant Conclusions When Testing the Validity of an Instrumental Variable,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2014.962764,OCT 2 2014,28,8,"An instrument or instrumental variable is often used in an effort to avoid selection bias in inference about the effects of treatments when treatment choice is based on thoughtful deliberation. Instruments are increasingly used in health outcomes research. An instrument is a haphazard push to accept one treatment or another, where the push can affect outcomes only to the extent that it alters the treatment received. There are two key assumptions here: (R) the push is haphazard or essentially random once adjustments have been made for observed covariates, (E) the push affects outcomes only by altering the treatment, the so-called ""exclusion restriction."" These assumptions are often said to be untestable; however, that is untrue if testable means checking the compatibility of assumptions with other things we think we know. A test of this sort may result in a collection of claims that are individually plausible but mutually inconsistent, without clear indication as to which claim is culpable for the inconsistency. We discuss this subject in the context of our on-going study of the effects of delivery by cesarean section on the survival of extremely premature infants of 23-24 weeks gestational age.

The Promise of Prediction Contests,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2014.937545,OCT 2 2014,16,2,"This article examines the prediction contest as a vehicle for aggregating the opinions of a crowd of experts. After proposing a general definition distinguishing prediction contests from other mechanisms for harnessing the wisdom of crowds, we focus on point-forecasting contests-contests in which forecasters submit point forecasts with a prize going to the entry closest to the quantity of interest. We first illustrate the incentive for forecasters to submit reports that exaggerate in the direction of their private information. Whereas this exaggeration raises a forecaster's mean squared error, it increases his or her chances of winning the contest. And in contrast to conventional wisdom, this nontruthful reporting usually improves the accuracy of the resulting crowd forecast. The source of this improvement is that exaggeration shifts weight away from public information (information known to all forecasters) and by so doing helps alleviate public knowledge bias. In the context of a simple theoretical model of overlapping information and forecaster behaviors, we present closed-form expressions for the mean squared error of the crowd forecasts which will help identify the situations in which point forecasting contests will be most useful.","Wisdom of crowds,Public knowledge bias,Forecasting contests,Forecast aggregation",OPTIMAL STRATEGIES,"Pfeifer, Phillip E.@Univ Virginia, Darden Sch Business, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA::Grushka-Cockayne, Yael@Univ Virginia, Darden Sch Business, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA::Lichtendahl, Kenneth C., Jr.@Univ Virginia, Darden Sch Business, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA","Pfeifer, Phillip E.@University of Virginia::Grushka-Cockayne, Yael@University of Virginia::Lichtendahl, Kenneth C., Jr.@University of Virginia",not exist,"Who herds?+Bernhardt, D; Campello, M; Kutsoati, E+JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS+JUN 2006::Eliminating public knowledge biases in information-aggregation mechanisms+Chen, KY; Fine, LR; Huberman, BA+MANAGEMENT SCIENCE+JUL 2004::Optimal strategies for sports betting pools+Clair, Bryan; Letscher, David+OPERATIONS RESEARCH+NOV-DEC 2007::Using Prediction Markets to Track Information Flows: Evidence from Google+Cowgill, Bo; Wolfers, Justin; Zitzewitz, Eric+AUCTIONS, MARKET MECHANISMS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS+2009::Toetjes Na+Ferguson, T.

A Coverage Probability Approach to Finding an Optimal Binomial Confidence Procedure,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2014.899274,AUG 2014,14,5,"The problem of finding confidence intervals for the success parameter of a binomial experiment has a long history, and a myriad of procedures have been developed. Most exploit the duality between hypothesis testing and confidence regions and are typically based on large sample approximations. We instead employ a direct approach that attempts to determine the optimal coverage probability function a binomial confidence procedure can have from the exact underlying binomial distributions, which in turn defines the associated procedure. We show that a graphical perspective provides much insight into the problem. Both procedures whose coverage never falls below the declared confidence level and those that achieve that level only approximately are analyzed. We introduce the Length/Coverage Optimal method, a variant of Sterne's procedure that minimizes average length while maximizing coverage among all length minimizing procedures, and show that it is superior in important ways to existing procedures.","Binomial confidence intervals,Exact confidence interval,Length minimizing","INTERVAL ESTIMATION,PROPORTION","Schilling, Mark F.@Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Math, Northridge, CA 91330 USA::Doi, Jimmy A.@Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Dept Stat, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA","Schilling, Mark F.@California State University System@California State University Northridge::Doi, Jimmy A.@California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo@California State University System",not exist,"Approximate is better than ""exact"" for interval estimation of binomial proportions+Agresti, A; Coull, BA+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1998::Confidence curves and improved exact confidence intervals for discrete distributions+Blaker, H+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+DEC 2000::BINOMIAL CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS+BLYTH, CR; STILL, HA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1983::Confidence intervals for a binomial proportion and asymptotic expansions+Brown, LD; Cai, TT; DasGupta, A+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 2002::Interval estimation for a binomial proportion - Comment - Rejoinder+Brown, LD; Cai, TT; DasGupta, A; et al.+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 2001::REFINING BINOMIAL CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS+CASELLA, G+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+JUN 1986::The use of confidence or fiducial limits illustrated in the case of the binomial.+Clopper, CJ; Pearson, ES+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1934::CONFIDENCE INTERVALS FOR A PROPORTION+CROW, EL+BIOMETRIKA+1956::no title+Hirji, K.F.+Exact analysis of discrete data+2006::Confidence intervals for the binomial parameter: some new considerations+Reiczigel, J+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+FEB 28 2003::SOME REMARKS ON CONFIDENCE OR FIDUCIAL LIMITS+STERNE, TE+BIOMETRIKA+1954::Problems with binomial two-sided tests and the associated confidence intervals+Vos, Paul W.; Hudson, Suzanne+AUSTRALIAN &amp; NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+MAR 2008::Evaluation criteria for discrete confidence intervals: Beyond coverage and length+Vos, PW; Hudson, S+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 2005::Probable inference, the law of succession, and statistical inference+Wilson, EB+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1927"
New Statistical Tests for Detecting Disparate Impact Arising From Two-Stage Selection Processes,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2014.917054,AUG 2014,28,0,"Statistical evidence of a significant difference between the performance of a protected group and the majority on a preemployment exam is often critical when a court decides whether the exam has a disparate impact, that is, whether the exam has a disproportionate adverse impact on minority candidates. In many cases, the hiring or promotion process consists of two steps. Since disparate impact can occur at each step, parties submitting evidence may use statistical tests at each stage without accounting for a potential multiple comparisons problem. Because different courts have focused on data concerning either one or the other step or a composite of both, they have reached opposite conclusions when faced with similar data. After illustrating the issues, two two-step tests are recommended to alleviate the problem. The large sample properties of these tests are obtained. A simulation study shows that in most situations, the new tests have higher power than the ones in current use.","Brunner-Munzel-modified Wilcoxon test,Discrimination,Disparate impact,Equal employment,Statistical evidence,Two-step test","EEOCC 4/5 RULE,ADVERSE IMPACT,VARIANCES","Miao, Weiwen@Haverford Coll, Dept Math & Stat, Haverford, PA 19041 USA::Gastwirth, Joseph L.@George Washington Univ, Dept Stat, Washington, DC 20052 USA","Miao, Weiwen@Haverford College::Gastwirth, Joseph L.@George Washington University",not exist,"ANOTHER ANALYSIS OF THE EEOCC 4/5 RULE+BOARDMAN, AE+MANAGEMENT SCIENCE+1979::The nonparametric Behrens-Fisher problem: Asymptotic theory and a small-sample approximation+Brunner, E; Munzel, U+BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL+2000::Testing for adverse impact when sample size is small+Collins, Michael W.; Morris, Scott B.+JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY+MAR 2008::no title+Cramer, H.+Mathematical methods of statistics+1946::The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test under scrutiny+Fagerland, Morten W.; Sandvik, Leiv+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+MAY 1 2009::A NOTE ON LIMIT-THEOREMS FOR JOINT DISTRIBUTIONS WITH APPLICATIONS TO LINEAR SIGNED RANK STATISTICS+FLIGNER, MA+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1981::USE OF CONDITIONAL ASYMPTOTIC NORMALITY+FLIGNER, MA; HETTMANSPERGER, TP+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1979::Some Important Statistical Issues Courts Should Consider in Their Assessment of Statistical Analyses Submitted in Class Certification Motions: Implications for Dukes v.

A Simple Density-Based Empirical Likelihood Ratio Test for Independence,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2014.901922,AUG 2014,42,4,"We develop a novel nonparametric likelihood ratio test for independence between two random variables using a technique that is free of the common constraints of defining a given set of specific dependence structures. Our methodology revolves around an exact density-based empirical likelihood ratio test statistic that approximates in a distribution-free fashion the corresponding most powerful parametric likelihood ratio test. We demonstrate that the proposed test is very powerful in detecting general structures of dependence between two random variables, including nonlinear and/or random-effect dependence structures. An extensive Monte Carlo study confirms that the proposed test is superior to the classical nonparametric procedures across a variety of settings. The real-world applicability of the proposed test is illustrated using data from a study of biomarkers associated with myocardial infarction.

Given failure data for individual components of a coherent system, the bootstrap empirical system lifetime distribution derived here will be free of resampling error. We further derive distribution-free expressions for the bias associated with the bootstrap method for estimating the mean system lifetimes of parallel and series systems with statistically identical components. We show that bootstrapping underestimates the mean system lifetime for parallel systems and overestimates the mean system lifetime for series systems, although both bootstrap estimates are asymptotically unbiased.

Uniform Correlation Mixture of Bivariate Normal Distributions and Hypercubically Contoured Densities That Are Marginally Normal,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2014.909741,AUG 2014,10,1,"The bivariate normal density with unit variance and correlation rho is well known. We show that by integrating out rho, the result is a function of the maximum norm. The Bayesian interpretation of this result is that if we put a uniform prior over rho, then the marginal bivariate density depends only on the maximal magnitude of the variables. The square-shaped isodensity contour of this resulting marginal bivariate density can also be regarded as the equally weighted mixture of bivariate normal distributions over all possible correlation coefficients. This density links to the Khintchine mixture method of generating random variables. We use this method to construct the higher dimensional generalizations of this distribution. We further show that for each dimension, there is a unique multivariate density that is a differentiable function of the maximum norm and is marginally normal, and the bivariate density from the integral over rho is its special case in two dimensions.","Bivariate normal mixture,Khintchine mixture,Uniform prior over correlation",,"Zhang, Kai@Univ N Carolina, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA::Brown, Lawrence D.@Univ Penn, Dept Stat, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA::George, Edward@Univ Penn, Dept Stat, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA::Zhao, Linda@Univ Penn, Dept Stat, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Zhang, Kai@University of North Carolina Chapel Hill@University of North Carolina::Brown, Lawrence D.@University of Pennsylvania::George, Edward@University of Pennsylvania::Zhao, Linda@University of Pennsylvania","Zhang, Kai@N-5895-2016","Continuous Gaussian mixture modeling+Aylward, S; Pizer, S+INFORMATION PROCESSING IN MEDICAL IMAGING+1997::Modeling covariance matrices in terms of standard deviations and correlations, with application to shrinkage+Barnard, J; McCulloch, R; Meng, XL+STATISTICA SINICA+OCT 2000::CONSTRUCTING AND SIMULATING MULTIVARIATE DISTRIBUTIONS USING KHINTCHINE THEOREM+BRYSON, MC; JOHNSON, ME+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+1982::no title+ERDELYI A+TABLES INTEGRAL TRAN+1954::no title+Erdelyi, A.; Magnus, W.; Oberhettinger, F.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Tricomi, F.

All five use different methods and criteria that deliver different results, even for simple textbook examples. The article shows that some of the methods used are clearly incorrect and deliver incorrect results. Finally, it raises the question of the impact that this may have in hindering the use of design of experiments (DOE) by nonexpert practitioners, and it provides suggestions for making this analysis more effective and easier to understand.

"The Need for More Emphasis on Prediction: A ""Nondenominational"" Model-Based Approach",AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2013.836987,MAY 2014,40,5,"Prediction problems are ubiquitous. In a model-based approach to predictive inference, the values of random variables that are presently observable are used to make inferences about the values of random variables that will become observable in the future, and the joint distribution of the random variables or various of its characteristics are assumed to be known up to the value of a vector of unknown parameters. Such an approach has proved to be highly effective in many important applications.

This article argues that the performance of a prediction procedure in repeated application is important and should play a significant role in its evaluation. A ""nondenominational"" model-based approach to predictive inference is described and discussed; what in a Bayesian approach would be regarded as a prior distribution is simply regarded as part of a model that is hierarchical in nature. Some specifics are given for mixed-effects linear models, and an application to the prediction of the outcomes of basketball or football games (and to the ranking and rating of basketball or football teams) is included for purposes of illustration.","Basketball or football rankings and ratings,Bayesian inference,Empirical Bayes inference,Mixed-effects linear models,Selection bias,Shrinkage","MEAN SQUARED ERROR,GENERAL LINEAR-MODEL,FOOTBALL TEAMS,BAYES,METHODOLOGY,VARIANCES,SCORES","Harville, David A.@IBM Thomas J Watson Res Ctr, Business Analyt & Math Sci Dept, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA","Harville, David A.@International Business Machines (IBM)",not exist,"Predictive likelihood: A review+Bjornstad, JF.+Stat Sci+1990::Statistical modeling: The two cultures+Breiman, L+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+AUG 2001::Why do statisticians answer silly questions that no one ever asks?+Briggs, M.+Significance+2012::BAYESIAN POINT ESTIMATION USING THE PREDICTIVE DISTRIBUTION+CHRISTENSEN, R; HUFFMAN, MD+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+1985::no title+Cressie, N.

A Decorated Parallel Coordinate Plot for Categorical Longitudinal Data,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2014.887591,MAY 2014,13,4,"This article proposes a decorated parallel coordinate plot for longitudinal categorical data, featuring a jitter mechanism revealing the diversity of observed longitudinal patterns and allowing the tracking of each individual pattern, variable point and line widths reflecting weighted pattern frequencies, the rendering of simultaneous events, and different filter options for highlighting typical patterns. The proposed visual display has been developed for describing and exploring the order of event occurrences, but it can be equally applied to other types of longitudinal categorical data. Alongside the description of the principle of the plot, we demonstrate the scope of the plot with a real dataset.

He proposed using a causal calculus to determine which set of contradictory findings in an instance of the paradox should be acceptedthe aggregated data or the data disaggregated by conditioning on the third variable. Pearl used the example of a hypothetical quasi-experiment to argue that when third variables are not causal, one should not condition on them, andassuming no other sources of confoundingthe aggregated data should be accepted. Pearl was precipitate in his argument that it would be inappropriate to condition on the noncausal third variables in the example. Whether causal or not, third variables can convey critical information about a first-order relationship, study design, and previously unobserved variables. Any conditioning on a nontrivial third variable that produces Simpson's Paradox should be carefully examined before either the aggregated or the disaggregated findings are accepted, regardless of whether the third variable is thought to be causal. In some cases, neither set of data is trustworthy; in others, both convey information of value. Pearl's hypothetical example is used to illustrate this argument.","Causality,Confounding,Inference,Intermediate variable,Reversal effect,Spurious correlation","BIAS,ADJUSTMENT","Armistead, Timothy W.@Armistead Res & Invest Serv, Pinole, CA 94564 USA","Armistead, Timothy W.@Unknow",not exist,"Fallacies, Statistical+Agresti, A.+Encyclopedia of Statistical Science+1983::Correlations genuine and spurious in Pearson and Yule+Aldrich, J+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+NOV 1995::Simpson's paradox+Alin, Aylin+WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS+MAR-APR 2010::Does a Dose-Response Relationship Reduce Sensitivity to Hidden Bias?+[Anonymous].+Biostatistics+2003::no title+[Anonymous].+How the Laws of Physics Lie+1983::Beware the Lurking Variable: Understanding Confounding From Lurking Variables Using Graphs+[Anonymous].+STATS Magazine+2006::What is Wrong With Bayes Nets?+[Anonymous].+The Monist+2001::SEX BIAS IN GRADUATE ADMISSIONS - DATA FROM BERKELEY+BICKEL, PJ; HAMMEL, EA; OCONNELL, JW+SCIENCE+1975::no title+Bishop, YMM; Fienberg, SF; Holland, PW.+Discrete Multivariate Analysis+1975::SIMPSONS PARADOX AND SURE-THING PRINCIPLE+BLYTH, CR+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1972::Mathematical contributions to the theory of evolution.

Comment: A Fruitful Resolution to Simpson's Paradox via Multiresolution Inference,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2014.876842,FEB 1 2014,9,3,"Simpson's Paradox is really a Simple Paradox if one at all. Peeling away the paradox is as easy (or hard) as avoiding a comparison of apples and oranges, a concept requiring no mention of causality. We show how the commonly adopted notation has committed the gross-ery mistake of tagging unlike fruit with alike labels. Hence, the fruitful question to ask is not Do we condition on the third variable? but rather Are two fruits, which appear similar, actually similar at their core?. We introduce the concept of intrinsic similarity to escape this bind. The notion of core depends on how deep one looksthe multi resolution inference framework provides a natural way to define intrinsic similarity at the resolution appropriate for the treatment. To harvest the fruits of this insight, we will need to estimate intrinsic similarity, which often results in an indirect conditioning on the third variable. A ripening estimation theory shows that the standard treatment comparisons, unconditional or conditional on the third variable, are low hanging fruit but often rotten. We pose assumptions to pluck away higher-resolution (more conditional) comparisonsthe multiresolution framework allows us to rigorously assess the price of these assumptions against the resulting yield. One such assessment gives us Simpson's Warning: less conditioning is most likely to lead to serious bias when Simpson's Paradox appears.","Bias-variance tradeoff,Principal stratification","CAUSAL INFERENCE,PRINCIPAL STRATIFICATION","Liu, Keli@Harvard Univ, Dept Stat, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA::Meng, Xiao-Li@Harvard Univ, Dept Stat, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Liu, Keli@Harvard University::Meng, Xiao-Li@Harvard University",not exist,"Identification of causal effects using instrumental variables+Angrist, JD; Imbens, GW; Rubin, DB+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1996::Principal Stratification a Goal or a Tool?+[Anonymous].+The International Journal of Biostatistics+2011::Principal stratification in causal inference+Frangakis, CE; Rubin, DB+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2002::Principal stratification for causal inference with extended partial compliance+Jin, Hui; Rubin, Donald B.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2008::THE ROLE OF EXCHANGEABILITY IN INFERENCE+LINDLEY, DV; NOVICK, MR+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1981::A Trio of Inference Problems That Could Win You a Nobel Prize in Statistics (If You Help Fund It)+Meng, X.-L.+The Past, Present and Future of Statistical Science+2014::no title+Pearl, Judea.+Causality: Models, Reasoning, and Inference+2000::Causal inference using potential outcomes: Design, modeling, decisions+Rubin, DB+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2005::no title+Wasserman, L.+Simpson's Paradox Explained+June 20 2013"

Two Useful Reformulations of the Hazard Ratio,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2013.868827,FEB 1 2014,14,0,The hazard ratio is a standard summary for comparing survival curves yet hazard ratios are often difficult for scientists and clinicians to interpret. Insight into the interpretation of hazard ratios is obtained by relating hazard ratios to the maximum difference and an average difference between survival probabilities. These reformulations of the hazard ratio are useful in classroom discussions of survival analysis and when discussing analyses with scientists and clinicians. Large-sample distribution theory is provided for these reformulations of the hazard ratio.

"Prior Elicitation: Interactive Spreadsheet Graphics With Sliders Can Be Fun, and Informative",AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2013.868828,FEB 1 2014,20,6,"There are several approaches to setting priors in Bayesian data analysis. Some attempt to minimize the impact of the prior on the posterior, allowing the data to speak for themselves, or to provide Bayesian inferences that have good frequentist properties. In contrast, this note focuses on priors where scientific knowledge is used, possibly partially informative. There are many articles on the use of such subjective information. We focus on using standard software for eliciting priors from subject-matter specialists, in the form of models such as the binomial, Poisson, and normal. Our approach uses a common spreadsheet package with the facility to display dynamic pictures of prior distributions as the user toggles scroll bars or sliders that manipulate parameters of particular distributions. This allows interactive exploration of the shape of a probability distribution. We have found this a useful tool when eliciting priors for Bayesian data analysis. We present examples to illustrate the scope and flexibility of the method.

Simultaneous Confidence Intervals for Several Quantiles of an Unknown Distribution,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2013.869259,FEB 1 2014,19,2,"Given a sample of independent observations from an unknown continuous distribution, it is standard practice to construct a confidence interval for a specified quantile of the distribution using the binomial distribution. Furthermore, confidence bands for the unknown cumulative distribution function, such as Kolmogorov's, provide simultaneous confidence intervals for all quantiles of the distribution, which are necessarily wider than the individual confidence intervals at the same confidence level. The purpose of this article is to show how simultaneous confidence intervals for several specified quantiles of the unknown distribution can be calculated using probabilities from a multinomial distribution. An efficient recursive algorithm is described for these calculations. An experimenter may typically be interested in several quantiles of the distribution, such as the median, quartiles, and upper and lower tail quantiles, and this methodology provides a bridge between the confidence intervals with individual confidence levels and those that can be obtained from confidence bands. Some examples of the implementation of this nonparametric methodology are provided, and some comparisons are made with some parametric approaches to the problem.","Binomial distribution,Confidence bands,Discrete data,Multinomial distribution,Nonparametric inference,Recursive computations","VARIANCE,BANDS","Hayter, A.

Applications of Multiple Systems Estimation in Human Rights Research,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2013.821093,NOV 2013,53,13,"Multiple systems estimation (MSE) is becoming an increasingly common approach for exploratory study of underreported events in the field of quantitative human rights. In this context, it is used to estimate the number of people who died as a result of political unrest when it is believed that many of those who died or disappeared were never reported. MSE relies upon several assumptions, each of which may be slightly or significantly violated in particular applications. This article outlines the evolution of the application of MSE to human rights research through the use of three case studies: Guatemala, Peru, and Colombia. Each of these cases presents distinct challenges to the MSE method. Motivated by these applications, we describe new methodology for assessing the impact of violated assumptions in MSE. Our approach uses simulations to explore the cumulative magnitude of errors introduced by violation of the model assumptions at each stage in the analysis.","Capture-recapture,Log-linear models,Mortality estimates,Record linkage","CAPTURE-RECAPTURE METHODS,POPULATION-SIZE,RECORD LINKAGE,MODELS,HETEROGENEITY,CENSUS,PROBABILITIES,CATCHABILITY,MORTALITY,SELECTION","Lum, Kristian@Virginia Tech, Network Dynam & Simulat Sci Lab, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Price, Megan Emily@Benetech, Palo Alto, CA 94306 USA::Banks, David@Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Lum, Kristian@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Price, Megan Emily@Unknow::Banks, David@Duke University",not exist,"no title+no author+Leave Us in Peace!

A Tale of Two Matrix Factorizations,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2013.845607,NOV 2013,21,2,"In statistical practice, rectangular tables of numeric data are commonplace, and are often analyzed using dimension-reduction methods like the singular value decomposition and its close cousin, principal component analysis (PCA). This analysis produces score and loading matrices representing the rows and the columns of the original table and these matrices may be used for both prediction purposes and to gain structural understanding of the data. In some tables, the data entries are necessarily nonnegative (apart, perhaps, from some small random noise), and so the matrix factors meant to represent them should arguably also contain only nonnegative elements. This thinking, and the desire for parsimony, underlies such techniques as rotating factors in a search for ""simple structure."" These attempts to transform score or loading matrices of mixed sign into nonnegative, parsimonious forms are, however, indirect and at best imperfect. The recent development of nonnegative matrix factorization, or NMF, is an attractive alternative. Rather than attempt to transform a loading or score matrix of mixed signs into one with only nonnegative elements, it directly seeks matrix factors containing only nonnegative elements. The resulting factorization often leads to substantial improvements in interpretability of the factors. We illustrate this potential by synthetic examples and a real dataset. The question of exactly when NMF is effective is not fully resolved, but some indicators of its domain of success are given. It is pointed out that the NMF factors can be used in much the same way as those coming from PCA for such tasks as ordination, clustering, and prediction.

Cohen described an adaptation with less explicit competition suitable for undergraduate students at a liberal arts college. This article details an adaptation of this modified Moore method to teach mathematical statistics, and describes ways that such an approach helps engage students and foster the teaching of statistics. Groups of students worked a set of three difficult problems (some theoretical, some applied) every two weeks. Class time was devoted to coaching sessions with the instructor, group meeting time, and class presentations. R was used to estimate solutions empirically, where analytic results were intractable, as well as to provide an environment to undertake simulation studies with the aim of deepening understanding and complementing analytic solutions. Each group presented comprehensive solutions to complement oral presentations. Development of parallel techniques for empirical and analytic problem solving was an explicit goal of the course, which also attempted to communicate ways that statistics can be used to tackle interesting problems. The group problemsolving component and use of technology allowed students to attemptmuch more challenging questions than they could otherwise solve.

Data Acquisition and Preprocessing in Studies on Humans: What is Not Taught in Statistics Classes?,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2013.842498,NOV 2013,13,13,"The aim of this article is to address issues in research that may be missing from statistics classes and important for (bio-) statistics students. In the context of a case study, we discuss data acquisition and preprocessing steps that fill the gap between research questions posed by subject matter scientists and statistical methodology for formal inference. Issues include participant recruitment, data collection training and standardization, variable coding, data review and verification, data cleaning and editing, and documentation. Despite the critical importance of these details in research, most of these issues are rarely discussed in an applied statistics program. One reason for the lack of more formal training is the difficulty in addressing the many challenges that can possibly arise in the course of a study in a systematic way. This article can help to bridge the gap between research questions and formal statistical inference by using an illustrative case study for a discussion. We hope that reading and discussing this article and practicing data preprocessing exercises will sensitize statistics students to these important issues and achieve optimal conduct, quality control, analysis, and interpretation of a study.","Applied statistics courses,Data cleaning,Data code book,Data collection,Data dictionary,Quality control,Statistical education","DOUBLE DATA-ENTRY,BIRTH-WEIGHT,RISK-FACTORS","Zhu, Yeyi@Univ Texas Austin, Dept Nutr Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA::Hernandez, Ladia M.@Univ Texas Austin, Dept Nutr Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA::Mueller, Peter@Univ Texas Austin, Dept Math, Austin, TX 78712 USA::Dong, Yongquan@Univ Texas Austin, Dept Nutr Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA::Forman, Michele R.@Univ Texas Austin, Dept Nutr Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Zhu, Yeyi@University of Texas Austin@University of Texas System::Hernandez, Ladia M.@University of Texas Austin@University of Texas System::Mueller, Peter@University of Texas Austin@University of Texas System::Dong, Yongquan@University of Texas Austin@University of Texas System::Forman, Michele R.@University of Texas Austin@University of Texas System",not exist,"no title+no author+ETHICALGUIDELINES FOR STATISTICAL PRACTICE+1999::VERIFYING KEYED MEDICAL-RESEARCH DATA+BLUMENSTEIN, BA+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+SEP 15 1993::no title+no author+CDC growth charts: United States+May 30, 2000::Double data entry: What value, what price?+Day, S; Fayers, P; Harvey, D+CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS+FEB 1998::Trends in Birth Weight and Gestational Length Among Singleton Term Births in the United States 1990-2005+Donahue, Sara M.

Should the Interquartile Range Divided by the Standard Deviation be Used to Assess Normality?,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2013.847385,NOV 2013,7,3,"We discourage the use of a diagnostic for normality: the in- terquartile range divided by the standard deviation. This statistic has been suggested in several introductory statistics books as a method to assess normality. Through simulation, we explore the rate at which this statistic converges to its asymptotic normal distribution, and the actual size of tests based on the asymptotic distribution at several sample sizes. We show that there are nonnormal distributions from which this method cannot detect a difference. Additionally, we show the power of this test for normality is quite poor when compared with the Shapiro-Wilk test.","Hypothesis testing,Power,Shapiro-Wilk test",,"Warr, Richard L.@Air Force Inst Technol, Dept Math & Stat, Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433 USA::Erich, Roger A.@Air Force Inst Technol, Dept Math & Stat, Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433 USA","Warr, Richard L.@Unknow::Erich, Roger A.@Unknow",not exist,"Asymptotic values and expansions for the correlation between different measures of spread+DasGupta, A; Haff, LR+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+JUL 1 2006::Sample quantiles in statistical packages+Hyndman, RJ; Fan, YN+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+NOV 1996::no title+Kokoska, S.+Introductory Statistics (Preliminary Edition): A Problem-Solving Approach+2008::no title+McClave, J.

Among the popular tests for normality, only the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test has a graphical representation. Alternative tests, such as the Shapiro-Wilk test, offer little insight as to how the observed data deviate from normality. In this article, we discuss a simple new graphical procedure which provides simultaneous confidence bands for a normal quantile-quantile plot. These bands define a test of normality and are narrower in the tails than those related to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Correspondingly, the new procedure has greater power to detect deviations from normality in the tails.

Closed Likelihood Ratio Testing Procedures to Assess Similarity of Covariance Matrices,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2013.791643,AUG 2013,33,9,"In this article, we introduce a multiple testing procedure to assess a common covariance structure between k groups. The new test allows for a choice among eight different patterns arising from the three-term eigen decomposition of the group covariances. It is based on the closed testing principle and adopts local likelihood ratio (LR) tests. The approach reveals richer information about the underlying data structure than classical methods, the most common one being only based on homo/heteroscedasticity. At the same time, it provides a more parsimonious parameterization, whenever the constrained model is suitable to describe the real data. The new inferential methodology is then applied to some well-known datasets chosen from the multivariate literature. Finally, simulation results are presented to investigate its performance in different situations representing gradual departures from homoscedasticity and to evaluate the reliability of using the asymptotic chi(2) to approximate the actual distribution of the local LR test statistics.","Closed testing procedures,Common principal components,Eigen decomposition,Homoscedasticity,Likelihood ratio tests,Proportional covariance matrices",MODEL SELECTION,"Greselin, Francesca@Univ Milano Bicocca, Dipartimento Metodi Quantitat Sci Econ & Aziendal, Milan, Italy::Punzo, Antonio@Univ Catania, Dipartimento Econ & Impresa, Catania, Italy","Greselin, Francesca@University of Milano-Bicocca::Punzo, Antonio@University of Catania","Greselin, Francesca@A-8770-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2929-1748::Punzo, Antonio@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7742-1821","Information theory as an extension of the maximum likelihood principle+Akaike, H.+2 INT S INF THEOR+1973::no title+Anderson,, T.

On the Effect and Remedies of Shrinkage on Classification Probability Estimation,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2013.817356,AUG 2013,26,4,"Shrinkage methods have been shown to be effective for classification problems. As a form of regularization, shrinkage through penalization helps to avoid overfitting and produces accurate classifiers for prediction, especially when the dimension is relatively high. Despite the benefit of shrinkage on classification accuracy of resulting classifiers, in this article, we demonstrate that shrinkage creates biases on classification probability estimation. In many cases, this bias can be large and consequently yield poor class probability estimation when the sample size is small or moderate. We offer some theoretical insights into the effect of shrinkage and provide remedies for better class probability estimation.

Are Independent Parameter Draws Necessary for Multiple Imputation?,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2013.821953,AUG 2013,22,0,"In typical implementations of multiple imputation for missing data, analysts create m completed datasets based on approximately independent draws of imputation model parameters. We use theoretical arguments and simulations to show that, provided m is large, the use of independent draws is not necessary. In fact, appropriate use of dependent draws can improve precision relative to the use of independent draws. It also eliminates the sometimes difficult task of obtaining independent draws; for example, in fully Bayesian imputation models based on MCMC, analysts can avoid the search for a subsampling interval that ensures approximately independent draws for all parameters. We illustrate the use of dependent draws in multiple imputation with a study of the effect of breast feeding on children's later cognitive abilities.","Bayesian,Missing,Nonresponse,Survey",MISSING DATA,"Hu, Jingchen@Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA::Mitra, Robin@Univ Southampton, Dept Math, Southampton S017 1B, Hants, England::Reiter, Jerome@Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Hu, Jingchen@Duke University::Mitra, Robin@University of Southampton::Reiter, Jerome@Duke University",not exist,"Small-sample degrees of freedom with multiple imputation+Barnard, J; Rubin, DB+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1999::Applications of multiple imputation in medical studies: from AIDS as NHANES+Barnard, J; Meng, XL+STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH+MAR 1999::Practical Markov chain Monte Carlo+Geyer, CJ.+Stat Sci+1992::How many imputations are really needed? - Some practical clarifications of multiple imputation theory+Graham, John W.; Olchowski, Allison E.; Gilreath, Tamika D.+PREVENTION SCIENCE+SEP 2007::Multiple imputation: Review of theory, implementation and software+Harel, Ofer; Zhou, Xiao-Hua+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUL 20 2007::Energy Analysis of Neighbor Discovery in Bluetooth Low Energy Networks+Liu, J.; Cheng, C.+Technical Report+2012::SUBSAMPLING THE GIBBS SAMPLER+MACEACHERN, SN; BERLINER, LM+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 1994::Estimating propensity scores with missing covariate data using general location mixture models+Mitra, Robin; Reiter, Jerome P.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+MAR 15 2011::The importance of modeling the survey design in multiple imputation for missing data+Reiter, J.

Model selection and model averaging are based on the posterior probabilities for the model set. Reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) extends ordinary MCMC methods to this meta-model. We describe a version of RJMCMC that intuitively represents the process as Gibbs sampling with alternating updates of a categorical variable M (for Model) and a ""palette"" of parameters psi, from which any of the model-specific parameters can be calculated. Our representation makes plain how model-specific Monte Carlo outputs (analytical or numerical) can be post-processed to compute model weights or Bayes factors.

Better Articulating Normal Curve Theory for Introductory Mathematical Statistics Students: Power Transformations and Their Back-Transformations,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2013.801782,AUG 2013,31,3,"This article addresses a gap in many, if not all, introductory mathematical statistics textbooks, namely, transforming a random variable so that it better mimics a normal distribution. Virtually all such textbooks treat the subject of variable transformations, which furnishes a nice opportunity to introduce and study this transformation-to-normality topic, a topic students frequently encounter in subsequent applied statistics courses. Accordingly, this article reviews variable power transformations of the Box-Cox type within the context of normal curve theory, as well as addresses their corresponding back-transformations. It presents four theorems and a conjecture that furnish the basics needed to derive equivalent results for all nonnegative values of the Box-Cox power transformation exponent. Results are illustrated with the exponential random variable.

Logistic Regression With Multiple Random Effects: A Simulation Study of Estimation Methods and Statistical Packages,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2013.817357,AUG 2013,35,20,"Several statistical packages are capable of estimating generalized linear mixed models and these packages provide one or more of three estimation methods: penalized quasi-likelihood, Laplace, and Gauss-Hermite. Many studies have investigated these methods' performance for the mixed-effects logistic regression model. However, the authors focused on models with one or two random effects and assumed a simple covariance structure between them, which may not be realistic. When there are multiple correlated random effects in a model, the computation becomes intensive, and often an algorithm fails to converge. Moreover, in our analysis of smoking status and exposure to antitobacco advertisements, we have observed that when a model included multiple random effects, parameter estimates varied considerably from one statistical package to another even when using the same estimation method. This article presents a comprehensive review of the advantages and disadvantages of each estimation method. In addition, we compare the performances of the three methods across statistical packages via simulation, which involves two- and three-level logistic regression models with at least three correlated random effects. We apply our findings to a real dataset. Our results suggest that two packages-SAS GLIMMIX Laplace and Super Mix Gaussian quadrature-perform well in terms of accuracy, precision, convergence rates, and computing speed. We also discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the two packages in regard to sample sizes.","Adaptive Gauss-Hermite integration,Antismoking advertising,Laplace approximation,Mixed-effects logistic regression,Penalized quasi-likelihood","LINEAR MIXED MODELS,MULTILEVEL MODELS,LAPLACE APPROXIMATION,BINARY RESPONSES,UNITED-STATES,QUADRATURE,SMOKING","Kim, Yoonsang@Univ Illinois, Inst Hlth Res & Policy, Chicago, IL 60608 USA::Choi, Young-Ku@Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL 60608 USA::Emery, Sherry@Univ Illinois, Inst Hlth Res & Policy, Chicago, IL 60608 USA","Kim, Yoonsang@University of Illinois Chicago Hospital@University of Illinois Chicago@University of Illinois System::Choi, Young-Ku@University of Illinois Chicago Hospital@University of Illinois Chicago@University of Illinois System::Emery, Sherry@University of Illinois Chicago Hospital@University of Illinois Chicago@University of Illinois System",not exist,"lme4: linear mixed- eff ects models using S4 classes+Bates, D; Maechler, M.+LME4 LINEAR MIXED EF+2010::Parameter Estimation in the Context of Non-Linear Longitudinal Growth Models+Bock, R.D.; Du Toit, S.

Using the Exterior Match to Compare Two Entwined Matched Control Groups,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2013.769914,MAY 2013,25,7,"When comparing outcomes, such as survival, in two groups-say a focal group and a comparison group-a common question is whether an adjustment for certain baseline differences that separate these two groups actually matters for the difference in outcomes. Did the adjustment matter? If it did matter, to what quantitative extent did it matter? This question is quite distinct from whether the baseline variables predict the outcome: baseline variables may predict the outcome, yet explain no part of the difference in outcomes in two groups. The question is also distinct from whether a difference between the groups remains after adjustment: an adjustment may matter quite a bit, yet fail to explain a substantial part of the difference in outcomes, and, indeed, adjustment may increase the difference. Whether an adjustment for (x(1), x(2)) matters over and above an adjustment for x(1) alone can be addressed by comparing outcomes in two control groups formed from the comparison group, one matched to the focal group for xi alone, the other matched to focal group for (x(1), x(2)). How do outcomes differ in these two matched control groups? If two control groups are each pair-matched to the same focal group, then the result is a set of matched triples, so controls in the two groups are implicitly matched to each other by virtue of being matched to the same person in the focal group. When the comparison group is vastly larger than the focal group and their distributions exhibit extensive overlap on (x(1), x(2)), it may be possible to construct nonintersecting matched control groups, but quite often the comparison group is large enough to yield closely matched groups one at a time, but is not large enough to produce several nonintersecting matched control groups. How can one compare two matched control groups that are entwined, with some of the same controls in both groups? Two entwined control groups have a nonempty intersection: some of the same controls appear in both groups as duplicates. These duplicates may appear in the same matched triple, but more commonly they appear in different matched triples. This structure yields a new nonintersecting match that we call the exterior match. Properties of the exterior match are discussed.

Estimating Omissions From Searches,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2013.783881,MAY 2013,27,4,"The mark-recapture method was devised by Petersen in 1896 to estimate the number of fish migrating into the Limfjord, and independently by Lincoln in 1930 to estimate waterfowl abundance. The technique can be applied to any search for a finite number of items by two or more people or agents, allowing the number of searched-for items to be estimated. This ubiquitous problem appears in fields from ecology and epidemiology, through to mathematics, social sciences, and computing. Here, we exactly calculate the moments of the hypergeometric distribution associated with this longstanding problem, confirming that widely used estimates conjectured in 1951 are often too small. Our Bayesian approach highlights how different search strategies will modify the estimates. The estimates are applied to several examples. For some published applications, substantial errors are found to result from using the Chapman or Lincoln-Petersen estimates.

Majority Voting by Independent Classifiers Can Increase Error Rates,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2013.778788,MAY 2013,8,4,"The technique of ""majority voting"" of classifiers is used in machine learning with the aim of constructing a new combined classification rule that has better characteristics than any of a given set of rules. The ""Condorcet Jury Theorem"" is often cited, incorrectly, as support for a claim that this practice leads to an improved classifier (i.e., one with smaller error probabilities) when the given classifiers are sufficiently good and are uncorrelated. We specifically address the case of two-category classification, and argue that a correct claim can be made for independent (not just uncorrelated) classification errors (not the classifiers themselves), and offer an example demonstrating that the common claim is false.

Visualizing Longitudinal Data With Dropouts,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2013.785980,MAY 2013,11,0,"This article proposes a triangle plot to display longitudinal data with dropouts. The triangle plot is a tool of data visualization that can also serve as a graphical check for informativeness of the dropout process. There are similarities between the lasagna plot and the triangle plot, but the explicit use of dropout time as an axis is an advantage of the triangle plot over the more commonly used graphical strategies for longitudinal data. It is possible to interpret the triangle plot as a trellis plot, which gives rise to several extensions such as the triangle histogram and the triangle boxplot. R code is available to streamline the use of the triangle plot in practice.

Optimal Nonbipartite Matching and Its Statistical Applications,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2011.08294,FEB 2011,38,52,"Matching is a powerful statistical tool in design and analysis. Conventional two-group, or bipartite, matching has been widely used in practice. However, its utility is limited to simpler designs. In contrast, nonbipartite matching is not limited to the two-group case, handling multiparty matching situations. It can be used to find the set of matches that minimize the sum of distances based on a given distance matrix. It brings greater flexibility to the matching design, such as multigroup comparisons. Thanks to improvements in computing power and freely available algorithms to solve nonbipartite problems, the cost in terms of computation time and complexity is low. This article reviews the optimal nonbipartite matching algorithm and its statistical applications, including observational studies with complex designs and an exact distribution-free test comparing two multivariate distributions. We also introduce an R package that performs optimal nonbipartite matching. We present an easily accessible web application to make nonbipartite matching freely available to general researchers.","Bipartite matching,CRAN,Observational studies,Propensity score,R package","PROPENSITY-SCORE,CAUSAL INFERENCE,PREGNANCY,PROGRAMS,BALANCE,TIME,BIAS,CARE","Lu, Bo@Ohio State Univ, Div Biostat, Coll Publ Hlth, Columbus, OH 43210 USA::Greevy, Robert@Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Biostat, Nashville, TN 37232 USA::Xu, Xinyi@Ohio State Univ, Dept Stat, Coll Math & Phys Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA::Beck, Cole@Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Biostat, Nashville, TN 37232 USA","Lu, Bo@Ohio State University::Greevy, Robert@Vanderbilt University::Xu, Xinyi@Ohio State University::Beck, Cole@Vanderbilt University",not exist,"no title+ARMSTRONG CS+4 STANF U ROCK CTR C+2009::The influence of in-pregnancy smoking cessation programmes on partner quitting and women's social support mobilization: a randomized controlled trial [ISRCTN89131885]+Aveyard, P; Lawrence, T; Evans, O; et al.+BMC PUBLIC HEALTH+JUL 29 2005::Building a Stronger Instrument in an Observational Study of Perinatal Care for Premature Infants+Baiocchi, Mike; Small, Dylan S.; Lorch, Scott; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2010::Software for optimal matching in observational studies+Bergstralh, EJ; Kosanke, JL; Jacobsen, SJ+EPIDEMIOLOGY+MAY 1996::THE PLANNING OF OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES OF HUMAN-POPULATIONS+COCHRAN, WG+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-GENERAL+1965::Causal effects in, nonexperimental studies: Reevaluating the evaluation of training programs+Dehejia, RH; Wahba, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1999::Solving nonbipartite matching problems via shortest path techniques+Derigs, U.+Annals of Operations Research+1988::Estimating the Effects of Length of Exposure to a Training Program: The Case of Job Corps+Flores-Lagunes, A.; Gonzalez, A.; Neumann, T.+IZA Discussion Paper No. 2846+2007::Implementation of algorithms for maximum matching on non-bipartite graphs+Gabow, H.N.+THESIS STANFORD U+1973::Optimal multivariate matching before randomization+Greevy, R; Lu, B; Silber, JH; et al.+BIOSTATISTICS+APR 2004::Comparison of Multivariate Matching Methods: Structures, Distances, and Algorithms+Gu, Xing S.; Rosenbaum, Paul R.+Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics+1993::The essential role of balance tests in propensity-matched observational studies: Comments on 'A critical appraisal of propensity-score matching in the medical literature between 1996 and 2003' by Peter Austin, Statistics in Medicine+Hansen, B.

Concerns About Maximum Likelihood Estimation for the Three-Parameter Weibull Distribution: Case Study of Statistical Software,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2011.09103,FEB 2011,52,4,"Maximum likelihood estimation of the two-parameter Weibull distribution is straightforward; however, there are multiple methods for maximum likelihood estimation of the three-parameter Weibull. The third parameter for the three-parameter Weibull distribution shifts the origin from 0 to some generally positive value sometimes called the location, threshold, or minimum life. This article initially evaluates twelve statistical packages for four real-world datasets including oil spill data from the Gulf of Mexico. The different methods used by the packages result in fairly major differences in the estimated parameters between the statistical packages. Some statistical packages do not offer three-parameter Weibull estimation. Other software attempts the estimation in only certain cases. This may have major implications for those needing to estimate or apply the results of a three-parameter Weibull distribution that is used frequently in practice. A subset of the twelve packages is subsequently analyzed in detail based on an experimental design using pseudo-random Weibull datasets. This article also discusses the most common estimation method employed, which is maximizing a profile log-likelihood function.","Generalized extreme value,Pipeline spills,Platform spills,Profile log-likelihood,Reliability","RELIABILITY,MODELS,PARAMETERS,PACKAGES,LOCATION","Harper, William V.@Otterbein Univ, Westerville, OH 43081 USA::Eschenbach, Ted G.@Univ Alaska, Anchorage, AK 99504 USA@TGE Consulting, Anchorage, AK 99504 USA::James, Thomas R.@Otterbein Univ, Westerville, OH 43081 USA","Harper, William V.@Otterbein College::Eschenbach, Ted G.@University of Alaska Anchorage@University of Alaska System::James, Thomas R.@Otterbein College",not exist,"no title+Abernethy, R.

Previously Unrecognized Links Between Statistical Dependence and Some Common Modes of Convergence,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2011.09217,FEB 2011,5,0,"Most introductory courses in probability include the definitions of, and relationships between, convergence in distribution, probability, and mean square. Surprisingly, there are also links between the apparently unrelated notion of statistical dependence and two of these modes of convergence. These links are virtually absent from both the research literature and probability texts. Our goal here is to fill this gap, and by so doing provide some insight into the three modes of convergence. In particular, we establish ultimate dependence between members of a sequence of convergent random variables and its nondegenerate limit when convergence is in probability and in mean square. Through simple examples and graphical displays, we convey the heuristics that underlie the main results.","Convergence in distribution,Convergence in probability,Correlation,Dependence",,"Du, Yeting@McGill Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada::Hundt, Christopher@Google Inc, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA::Wolfson, David B.@McGill Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada","Du, Yeting@McGill University::Hundt, Christopher@Google Incorporated::Wolfson, David B.@McGill University",not exist,"no title+Billingsley, P.+Probability and Measure+1986::no title+Dudley, R.M.+Real Analysis and Probability+2002::no title+Mittelhammer, R.

Nano-Project Qualifying Exam Process: An Intensified Dialogue Between Students and Faculty,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2010.10027,NOV 2010,5,2,"An effectively designed examination process goes far beyond revealing students' knowledge or skills. It also serves as a great teaching and learning tool, incentivizing the students to think more deeply and to connect the dots at a higher level. This extends throughout the entire process: pre-exam preparation, the exam itself, and the post-exam period (the aftermath or, more appropriately, afterstat of the exam). As in the publication process, the first submission is essential but still just one piece in the dialogue.

Viewing the entire exam process as an extended dialogue between students and faculty, we discuss ideas for making this dialogue induce more inspiration than perspiration, and thereby making it a memorable deep-learning triumph rather than a wish-to-forget test-taking trauma. We illustrate such a dialogue through a recently introduced course in the Harvard Statistics Department, Stat 399: Problem Solving in Statistics, and two recent Ph.D. qualifying examination problems (with annotated solutions). The problems are examples of ""nano-projects"": big-picture questions split into bite-sized pieces, fueling contemplation and conversation throughout the entire dialogue.","Bias-variance trade-off,Confidence intervals with restricted parameter space,Mean squared error,Ph.D. Qualifying Examination,Preparation of and for exams,Statistical education",,"Blitzstein, Joseph@Harvard Univ, Dept Stat, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA::Meng, Xiao-Li@Harvard Univ, Dept Stat, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Blitzstein, Joseph@Harvard University::Meng, Xiao-Li@Harvard University",not exist,"no title+Ferguson, T.+A Course in Large Sample Theory+1996::Desired and Feared-What Do We Do Now and Over the Next 50 Years?+Meng, Xiao-Li+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 2009::no title+MENG XL+FRONTIERS STAT DECIS+2010::Exploiting gene-environment independence for analysis of case-control studies: An empirical bayes-type shrinkage estimator to trade-off between bias and efficiency+Mukherjee, Bhramar; Chatterjee, Nilanjan+BIOMETRICS+SEP 2008::no title+SMULLYAN R+5000 BC OTHER PHILOS+1983"
Construction of Confidence Intervals and Regions for Ordered Binomial Probabilities,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2010.09096,NOV 2010,15,3,"In biomedical studies and other areas, there are often situations where parameters are known to be ordered. in these situations, incorporating the order restriction can produce much more efficient estimates than ignoring it. There is much research on point estimation and tests with order restrictions, but little on the construction of confidence intervals. Our particular interest is in the case where two probabilities for binomial random variables can be equal or very close to each other, where difficulty arises and the standard methods for inference no longer apply. We investigate methods for constructing confidence intervals for the ordered probabilities based on appropriate asymptotic distributions and several versions of the bootstrap. Via simulation studies we find that the usual percentile bootstrap and a parametric bootstrap with parameter shrunk to the boundary both have good finite sample properties. We further consider the construction of confidence regions for two ordered probabilities. We propose a small sample test for the probabilities and a method for constructing confidence regions by inverting this test, which yields confidence regions with good coverage rates even in very small samples. Supplemental materials for the technical results and proofs are available online.","Binomial random variable,Bootstrap,Order restrictions,Small sample","INEQUALITY CONSTRAINTS,CONTINGENCY-TABLES,ALTERNATIVES,INFERENCE,BOOTSTRAP","Li, Zhiguo@Univ Michigan, Inst Social Res, Quantitat Methodol Program, Ann Arbor, MI 48106 USA::Taylor, Jeremy M.

Using the Cross-Match Test to Appraise Covariate Balance in Matched Pairs,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2010.09210,NOV 2010,30,15,"Having created a tentative matched design for an observational study, diagnostic checks are performed to see whether observed covariates exhibit reasonable balance, or alternatively whether further effort is required to improve the match. We illustrate the use of the cross-match test as an aid to appraising balance on high-dimensional covariates, and we discuss its close logical connections to the techniques used to construct matched samples. In particular, in addition to a significance level, the cross-match test provides an interpretable measure of high-dimensional covariate balance, specifically a measure defined in terms of the propensity score. An example from the economics of education is used to illustrate. In the example, imbalances in an initial match guide the construction of a better match. The better match uses a recently proposed technique, optimal tapered matching, that leaves certain possibly innocuous covariates imbalanced in one match but not in another, and yields a test of whether the imbalances are actually innocuous.","Multivariate matching,Observational study,Propensity score,Seemingly innocuous confounding,Tapered matching","PROPENSITY SCORE,DISTRIBUTIONS,ALGORITHM,BIAS","Heller, Ruth@Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Ind Engn & Management, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel::Rosenbaum, Paul R.@Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Dept Publ Policy & Management, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA::Small, Dylan S.@Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Dept Publ Policy & Management, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Heller, Ruth@Technion Israel Institute of Technology::Rosenbaum, Paul R.@University of Pennsylvania::Small, Dylan S.@University of Pennsylvania","Rosenbaum, Paul@H-8687-2012","Software for optimal matching in observational studies+Bergstralh, EJ; Kosanke, JL; Jacobsen, SJ+EPIDEMIOLOGY+MAY 1996::no title+Bertsekas, D.

Identifying Key Statistical Papers From 1985 to 2002 Using Citation Data for Applied Biostatisticians,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2010.08250,NOV 2010,77,3,"Dissemination of ideas from theory to practice is a significant challenge in statistics. Quick identification of articles useful to practitioners would greatly assist in this dissemination, thereby improving science. This article uses the citation count history of articles to identify key papers from 1985 to 2002 from 12 statistics journals for applied biostatisticians. One feature requiring attention in order to appropriately rank an article's impact is assessment of the citation accrual patterns over time. Citation counts in statistics differ dramatically from fields such as medicine. In statistics, most articles receive few citations, with 15-year-old articles from five key journals receiving a median of 13 citations compared to 66 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. However, statistics articles in the top 2%-3% continue to gain citations at a high rate past 15 years, exceeding those in JCO, whose counts slow dramatically around 8 years past publication. Articles with the highest expected applied uses 20 years post publication were identified using joinpoint regression. In this evaluation, the fraction of citations that represent applied use was defined and estimated. The false discovery rate, quantification of heterogeneity in meta-analysis, and generalized estimating equations rank as the ideas with the greatest estimated applied impact.","Applied fraction,Citation count,Statistical practice","SMOOTHING PARAMETER-ESTIMATION,PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODEL,LONGITUDINAL DATA-ANALYSIS,FALSE DISCOVERY RATE,LOGISTIC-REGRESSION,MULTIPLE IMPUTATION,INTERVAL ESTIMATION,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,SURVIVAL ANALYSIS,PUBLICATION BIAS","Schell, Michael J.@Univ S Florida, H Lee Moffitt Canc Ctr & Res Inst, Dept Biostat, Tampa, FL 33612 USA","Schell, Michael J.@State University System of Florida@University of South Florida@H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute",not exist,"Approximate is better than ""exact"" for interval estimation of binomial proportions+Agresti, A;

A Note on the Indeterminacy of the Random-Effects Distribution in Hierarchical Models,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2010.09244,NOV 2010,30,3,"Hierarchical models are regularly used for the analysis of longitudinal or clustered data. The estimators and inferential procedures are frequently derived from maximum likelihood theory, which assumes that the underlying probability model is correctly specified. Recent research shows that the results obtained from these models are not always robust against violations of the distributional assumptions for the random effects. As a consequence, diagnostic tools to detect such misspecification on the one hand, and alternative models allowing for more flexible random-effects distributions on the other hand, have been proposed in the literature. However, the intangible nature of random effects makes the evaluation of their distributional assumptions conceptually difficult. In the present work we show that such an evaluation requires additional assumptions regarding the conditional model (describing the outcomes, given the random effects), without which the distribution of the random effects is indeterminate. Consequently, the evaluation of the distributional assumptions of the random effects will necessarily demand a careful evaluation of the conditional model and it may require the use of extra scientific elements that go beyond the data.","Hierarchical model,Misspecification,Random effects","LINEAR MIXED MODELS,MULTIVARIATE MARGINALS,PROBABILITY-DISTRIBUTIONS,MIXING DISTRIBUTION,MIXTURES,FIT,IDENTIFIABILITY","Alonso, Ariel@Maastricht Univ, Dept Methodol & Stat, NL-6200 Maastricht, Netherlands::Litiere, Saskia@EORTC Headquarters, Dept Stat, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium::Laenen, Annouschka@Katholieke Univ Leuven, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium","Alonso, Ariel@Maastricht University::Litiere, Saskia@European Organisation for Research & Treatment of Cancer::Laenen, Annouschka@KU Leuven",not exist,"A general maximum likelihood analysis of variance components in generalized linear models+Aitkin, M+BIOMETRICS+MAR 1999::Testing for misspecification in generalized linear mixed models+Alonso, A.; Litiere, S.; Molenberghs, G.+Biostatistics+2010::IDENTIFIABILITY OF MIXTURES OF EXPONENTIAL FAMILIES+BARNDORF.O+JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS+1965::no title+Bartholomew, DJ; Knott, M.+Latent variable models and factor analysis+1999::no title+Borsboom, D.+Measuring the mind: Conceptual issues in contemporary psychometrics+2005::no title+Burnham,, K.

Adding Spatially-Correlated Errors Can Mess Up the Fixed Effect You Love,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2010.10052,NOV 2010,13,94,"Many statisticians have had the experience of fitting a linear model with uncorrelated errors, then adding a spatially-correlated error term (random effect) and finding that the estimates of the fixed-effect coefficients have changed substantially. We show that adding a spatially-correlated error term to a linear model is equivalent to adding a saturated collection of canonical regressors, the coefficients of which are shrunk toward zero, where the spatial map determines both the canonical regressors and the relative extent of the coefficients' shrinkage. Adding a spatially-correlated error term can also be seen as inflating the error variances associated with specific contrasts of the data, where the spatial map determines the contrasts and the extent of error-variance inflation. We show how to avoid this spatial confounding by restricting the spatial random effect to the orthogonal complement (residual space) of the fixed effects, which we call restricted spatial regression. We consider five proposed interpretations of spatial confounding and draw implications about what, if anything, one should do about it. in doing so, we debunk the common belief that adding a spatially-correlated random effect adjusts fixed-effect estimates for spatially-structured missing covariates.

A General Example for Benford Data,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2010.09169,NOV 2010,11,1,"Benford's Law deals, among other things, with the proportion of numbers whose first significant digit is a 1 (e.g., 0.00131 and 19668 both have first significant digit 1) in a variety of datasets. In these datasets, which arise in various compendiums or as mixtures of various sets of numbers, the proportion of numbers with first significant digit one is 0.3010 which is much higher than the commonsense value of 1/9. The reasons for this occurrence have been elusive. Mathematical attempts to explain this phenomenon have been relatively fruitless. Methods involving probability have been somewhat more successful. In this article we give some simple reasons for this occurrence and also give an example of a general mixture of distributions which exactly satisfies this Law.

Simpson's Paradox From Adding Constants in Contingency Tables as an Example of Bayesian Noncollapsibility,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2010.10006,NOV 2010,25,7,"Although alternatives have long been available, adding a constant to the cells of a contingency table remains common in practice, especially to avoid problems from zero counts or small cells. There is a certain illogic to the practice, however: It injects unfounded prior information about nuisance parameters. As a result, it can induce a form of Simpson's paradox, producing a point estimate of the target parameter that is outside the interval bounded by the maximum likelihood estimate from the observed table and the null value of the parameter implied by the constants. Furthermore, it can increase apparent evidence against the null hypothesis, even if both the observed data and the added constants fit this null. The paradox can be seen as arising from default independence priors or additive penalty functions. It can be avoided with simple modifications of constants, or by relevant reparameterization. More generally, noncollapsibility over the prior and likelihood may signal a problem with the prior specification when the prior does not penalize the target parameter directly.","Bayesian inference,Collapsibility,Conjugate priors,Penalized likelihood,Prior distributions,Shrinkage estimation,Smoothing","CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS,COLLAPSIBILITY,PRIORS,PROPORTIONS,REGRESSION,RISK,BIAS,SURVIVAL","Greenland, Sander@Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Epidemiol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA@Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Stat, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Greenland, Sander@University of California Los Angeles@University of California System",not exist,"Simple and effective confidence intervals for proportions and differences of proportions result from adding two successes and two failures+Agresti, A; Caffo, B+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+NOV 2000::Approximate is better than ""exact"" for interval estimation of binomial proportions+Agresti, A; Coull, BA+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1998::Frequentist performance of Bayesian confidence intervals for comparing proportions in 2 x 2 contingency tables+Agresti, A; Min, YY+BIOMETRICS+JUN 2005::Bayesian binomial regression: Predicting survival at a trauma center+Bedrick, EJ; Christensen, R; Johnson, W+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 1997::A new perspective on priors for generalized linear models+Bedrick, EJ; Christensen, R; Johnson, W+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1996::no title+Bishop, YMM; Fienberg, SF; Holland, PW.+Discrete Multivariate Analysis+1975::RECONCILING BAYESIAN AND FREQUENTIST EVIDENCE IN THE ONE-SIDED TESTING PROBLEM+CASELLA, G; BERGER, RL+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1987::MULTIPLE IMPUTATION OF INDUSTRY AND OCCUPATION CODES IN CENSUS PUBLIC-USE SAMPLES USING BAYESIAN LOGISTIC-REGRESSION+CLOGG, CC; RUBIN, DB; SCHENKER, N; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1991::ON BIAS OF VARIOUS ESTIMATORS OF LOGIT AND ITS VARIANCE WITH APPLICATION TO QUANTAL BIOASSAY+GART, JJ; ZWEIFEL, JR+BIOMETRIKA+1967::COLLAPSIBILITY OF RELATIVE RISK IN CONTINGENCY-TABLES WITH A RESPONSE VARIABLE+GENG, Z+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1992::no title+Good, I.

A Decision-Theoretic Formulation of Fisher's Approach to Testing,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2010.09060,NOV 2010,25,4,"In Fisher's interpretation of statistical testing, a test is seen as a 'screening' procedure; one either reports some scientific findings, or alternatively gives no firm conclusions. These choices differ fundamentally from hypothesis testing, in the style of Neyman and Pearson, which does not consider a noncommittal response; tests are developed as choices between two complementary hypotheses, typically labeled 'null' and 'alternative.' The same choices are presented in typical Bayesian tests, where Bayes Factors are used to judge the relative support for a null or alternative model. In this article, we use decision theory to show that Bayesian tests can also describe Fisher-style 'screening' procedures, and that such approaches lead directly to Bayesian analogs of the Wald test and two-sided p-value, and to Bayesian tests with frequentist properties that can be determined easily and accurately. In contrast to hypothesis testing, these 'screening' decisions do not exhibit the Lindley/Jeffreys paradox, that divides frequentists and Bayesians.","Bayesian inference,Decision theory,Testing","GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION,P-VALUES,RANDOM-VARIABLES,BAYES FACTORS,NEYMAN,HYPOTHESIS,PARADOX,PEARSON","Rice, Kenneth@Univ Washington, Dept Biostat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Rice, Kenneth@University of Washington@University of Washington Seattle","Rice, Kenneth@A-4150-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5779-4495","TESTING A POINT NULL HYPOTHESIS - THE IRRECONCILABILITY OF P-VALUES AND EVIDENCE+BERGER, JO; SELLKE, T+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1987::Could Fisher, Jeffreys and Neyman have agreed on testing?+Berger, JO+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+FEB 2003::A PARADOX IN DECISION-THEORETIC INTERVAL ESTIMATION+CASELLA, G; HWANG, JTG; ROBERT, C+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 1993::Testing Fisher, Neyman, Pearson, and Bayes+Christensen, R+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 2005::no title+Cox, DR; Hinkley, DV.+Theoretical statistics+2000::Empirical Bayes screening of many p-values with applications to microarray studies+Datta, S; Datta, S+BIOINFORMATICS+MAY 1 2005::ELICITATION OF PRIOR DISTRIBUTIONS FOR VARIABLE-SELECTION PROBLEMS IN REGRESSION+GARTHWAITE, PH; DICKEY, JM+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1992::Multiplicity-calibrated Bayesian hypothesis tests+Guo, Mengye; Heitjan, Daniel F.+BIOSTATISTICS+JUL 2010::Confusion over measures of evidence (p's) versus errors (a's) in classical statistical testing+Hubbard, R; Bayarri, MJ+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 2003::Why We Don't Really Know What Statistical Significance Means: Implications for Educators+Hubbard, Raymond; Armstrong, J.+JOURNAL OF MARKETING EDUCATION+AUG 2006::Final collapse of the Neyman-Pearson decision theoretic framework and rise of the neoFisherian+Hurlbert, Stuart H.; Lombardi, Celia M.+ANNALES ZOOLOGICI FENNICI+OCT 30 2009::Bayes factors: What they are and what they are not+Lavine, M; Schervish, MJ+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1999::A STATISTICAL PARADOX+LINDLEY, DV+BIOMETRIKA+1957::On the Bayesianity of Pereira-Stern tests+Madruga, MR; Esteves, LG; Wechsler, S+TEST+DEC 2001::no title+MAYO D+IMS LECT NOTES MONOG+2006::On the frequentist and Bayesian approaches to hypothesis testing+Moreno, E.; Giron, F.

Variance Stabilizing the Difference of Two Binomial Proportions,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2010.09080,NOV 2010,10,17,"The article studies estimation of Delta = p(1) - p(2), the difference of two proportions p(1) and p(2), based on two independent Binomial experiments of size n(1) and n(2). The usual estimator, the difference between the two sample proportions, is variance stabilized conditionally on a weighted average of p(1) and p(2). When using this variance stabilized statistic as a test, a new family of confidence intervals for Delta is found. We show with a simulation study that these confidence intervals compare favorably in coverage accuracy and width to two other popular intervals proposed by Newcombe and Agresti and Caffo. Because no additional study weights need estimating, the variance stabilized statistic is also well-suited for combining results from independent studies.

Two Pitfalls in Survival Analyses of Time-Dependent Exposure: A Case Study in a Cohort of Oscar Nominees,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2010.08259,AUG 2010,27,24,"Bias is a common concern in applications of survival analysis. The reason for it is often related to sampling schemes or time-dependent intermediate events. In many situations the bias can be avoided by a proper statistical analysis. In this tutorial we explain why and how results are biased if the temporal dynamics are not adequately modeled. Multistate models provide a relevant framework to display and circumvent certain types of survival bias. Using a publicly available database of Oscar nominees, we focus on length bias as well as time-dependent bias. Motivating examples are given of how both types occur in the literature. Interestingly, in the Oscar example length bias and time-dependent bias have opposite effects in terms of the direction of the estimation bias. We further recall techniques which are available and implemented in statistical softwares to avoid these types of bias. A better understanding of these issues may prevent these biases and improve the statistical analysis in medical and other fields.","Cumulative hazard,Event history,Hazard ratio,Left truncation,Survival bias","MULTISTATE MODELS,BIAS,REANALYSIS,WINNERS","Wolkewitz, Martin@Univ Med Ctr Freiburg, Inst Med Biometry & Med Informat, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany@Univ Freiburg, Freiburg Ctr Data Anal & Modelling, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany::Allignol, Arthur@Univ Med Ctr Freiburg, Inst Med Biometry & Med Informat, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany@Univ Freiburg, Freiburg Ctr Data Anal & Modelling, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany::Schumacher, Martin@Univ Med Ctr Freiburg, Inst Med Biometry & Med Informat, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany::Beyersmann, Jan@Univ Med Ctr Freiburg, Inst Med Biometry & Med Informat, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany@Univ Freiburg, Freiburg Ctr Data Anal & Modelling, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany","Wolkewitz, Martin@University of Freiburg::Allignol, Arthur@University of Freiburg::Schumacher, Martin@University of Freiburg::Beyersmann, Jan@University of Freiburg",not exist,"mvna: An R package for the Nelson-Aalen estimator in multistate models+Allignol, A.; Beyersmann, J.; Schumacher, M.+R Newsletter+2008::Comparing survival distributions via hazard ratio estimates+Andersen, P.

A major collision came in 1953, when Cox was editor of Biometrics. Fisher submitted an article critical of four contemporary statisticians and did not want to change it. Cox published his article and comments by the four, all in the same issue. There was deep underlying respect, however, and Fisher lectured and taught for Cox in North Carolina afterward.

This article provides a new moment generating function proof of Lindeberg-Levy which does not weaken it by requiring the existence of the mgf or higher order moments of the constituent random variables.

A Geometric Comparison of the Delta and Fieller Confidence Intervals,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2010.08130,AUG 2010,29,7,"The comparison of the Delta and Fieller confidence intervals for the ratio of parameters estimated by normally distributed random variables has long been of interest. Our contribution is the construction of a common geometric representation of both the Delta and Fieller intervals defined by two related constrained extrema problems that are subject to a common constraint. The diagrammatic solution to these problems can be used to examine how earlier comparisons based on alternate analytic relationships and simulations have resulted in the particular conclusions they report. We find that the degree to which the Delta and Fieller intervals coincide depends not only on the univariate statistics for the estimated parameters, but also on the agreement of the sign of their estimated correlation and the ratio of estimated parameters.

Fixed-Width Sequential Confidence Intervals for a Proportion,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2010.09140,AUG 2010,20,10,"Fixed-sample-size confidence intervals for a proportion p have widths that vary depending on the observed number of successes. In this article, we develop sequential methods for obtaining fixed-width confidence intervals for p. These methods are exact, and the confidence intervals have the simple form [max(0, (p) over cap - h), min(1, (p) over cap + h)], where (p) over cap is the observed proportion and h is a user-chosen half-width. We consider four possible stopping rules for obtaining the intervals, and we find that a rule based on estimating the variance of (p) over cap seems to perform best in terms of average run length and coverage probability. The new sequential confidence interval methods provide a valid way to obtain the desired accuracy in sample surveys and Monte Carlo simulation studies without doing excessively many runs.

Computing in the Statistics Curricula,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2010.09132,MAY 2010,40,13,"The nature of statistics is changing significantly with many opportunities to broaden the discipline and its impact on science and policy. To realize this potential, our curricula and educational culture must change. While there are opportunities for significant change in many dimensions, we focus more narrowly on computing and call for computing concepts to be integrated into the statistics curricula at all levels. Computational literacy and programming are as fundamental to statistical practice and research as mathematics. We advocate that our field needs to define statistical computing more broadly to include advancements in modern computing, beyond traditional numerical algorithms. Information technologies are increasingly important and should be added to the curriculum, as should the ability to reason about computational resources, work with large datasets, and perform computationally intensive tasks. We present an approach to teaching these topics in combination with scientific problems and modern statistical methods that focuses on ideas and skills for statistical inquiry and working with data. We outline the broad set of computational topics we might want students to encounter and offer ideas on how to teach them. We also discuss efforts to share pedagogical resources to help faculty teach this modern material (including supplemental materials).","Computational literacy,Curriculum reform,Information technology",,"Nolan, Deborah@Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Stat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA::Lang, Duncan Temple@Univ Calif Davis, Dept Stat, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Nolan, Deborah@University of California System@University of California Berkeley::Lang, Duncan Temple@University of California Davis@University of California System","Temple Lang, Duncan@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0159-1546","The jammed phase of the Biham-Middleton-Levine traffic model+Angel, O; Holroyd, AE; Martin, JB+ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS IN PROBABILITY+AUG 12 2005::A conversation with John Hartigan+Barry, D+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+NOV 2005::Elephant-seal movements: Modelling migration+Brillinger, DR; Stewart, BS+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+SEP 1998::What Is Statistics?+Brown, Emery N.; Kass, Robert E.+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 2009::no title+CHAMBERS RBJ+NEW S LANGUAGE PROGR+1988::Interactive and Dynamic Graphics for Data Analysis: With R and Ggobi+Cook, D; Swayne, DF+INTERACTIVE AND DYNAMIC GRAPHICS FOR DATA ANALYSIS: WITH R AND GGOBI+2007::no title+DIMOV D+SWIVEL+2009::The role of Statistics in the data revolution?+Friedman, JH+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+APR 2001::no title+*GAPMINDER FDN+GAPMINDER WORLD+2008::Courses in statistical computing and computational statistics+Gentle, JE+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+FEB 2004::Statistical analyses and reproducible research+Gentleman, Robert; Lang, Duncan Temple+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+MAR 2007::no title+*IBM+MAN EYES SHAR VIS DI+2009::no title+JAMES DA+RSQLITE SQLITE INTER+2009::no title+KAPLAN DT+INTRO SCI COMPUTATIO+2004::no title+King, T.; Kopf, S.; Haenselmann, T.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Lubberger, C.; Effelsberg, W</span>.+CRAWDAD data setmannheim/compass+Apr. 2008::no title+LAHMAN S+SEAN LAHMANS BASEBAL+2008::Optimization of a multicarrier system for digital cable transmission+Lange, C+FREQUENZ+JAN-FEB 2004::Dynamic generation of statistical reports using literate data analysis+Leisch, F.+COMPSTAT 2002+2002::no title+LENTH R+STATWEAVE+2009::no title+Long, S.+The workflow of data analysis using Stata+2009::no title+no author+Matlab+2009::Teaching statistical computing at North Carolina State University+Monahan, J+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+FEB 2004::no title+Murrell, P.+R Graphics.

"Calculating Strength of Schedule, and Choosing Teams for March Madness",AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2010.09161,MAY 2010,12,2,"We propose a new way of quantifying a team's strength of schedule for NCAA basketball. This strength of a schedule is defined as the number of :lames a team on the borderline of the annual national tournament would expect to win if they played that schedule. Our method gives a direct way of quantifying how well different teams have done relative to the schedules they have played. The motivation for constructing this strength of schedule is to help inform the choice of teams given bids to the national tournament: teams who have won more games than their strength of schedule have strongest evidence that they deserve such a bid. Estimating the strength of schedules is possible through fitting a simple statistical model to the results of all regular season matches. We are able to quantify the uncertainty in these estimates, which helps differentiate between teams with clear evidence for selection and those on the borderline. Our results suggest that St. Mary's warranted a bid to the 2009 tournament, at the expense of Wisconsin; and that both Arizona State and Nebraska warranted bids to the 2008 tournament instead of South Alabama and St. Joseph's.

Examples are given where the symmetrized estimator has superior asymptotic properties to those of a naive estimator, implying that knowledge of reversibility can sometimes improve estimation. The asymptotic mean and variance of the estimators are quantified.

Rank-Based Analyses of Stratified Experiments: Alternatives to the van Elteren Test,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2010.08121,MAY 2010,36,3,"The van Elteren test, a popular extension of the Wilcoxon rank sum test for comparing two treatments in a stratified experiment, uses within-stratum ranks and assigns larger weight to rank sums from smaller strata. It performs well if the treatment effect is constant across strata, but it can be grossly inefficient otherwise. Existing alternatives to the van Elteren test include tests that use overall ranks and/or equal stratum weights, and the aligned rank test of Hodges and Lehmann. We develop two new testing procedures. The first replaces the stratum weights in the van Elteren test with corresponding weights based on estimated treatment effects and sample sizes. The second uses the aligned rank test and a version of the van Elteren test with equal stratum weights in a sequential manner via an adaptive multiple testing strategy. The new and existing tests are compared to the van Elteren test via extensive simulations.

Improper Priors Are Not Improper,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2010.09116,MAY 2010,19,13,"It is well known that improper priors in Bayesian statistics may lead to proper posterior distributions and useful inference procedures. This motivates us to give an elementary introduction to a theoretical frame for statistics that includes improper priors. Axioms that allow improper priors are given by a relaxed version of Kolmogorov's formulation of probability theory. The theory of conditional probability spaces formulated by Renyi is closely related, but the initial axioms and the motivation differ. One consequence of the axioms is a general Bayes theorem which gives proper posterior distributions, and furthermore, the theory also gives a convenient frame for formulation of non-Bayesian statistical models. The results are in particular relevant for the current usage of improper priors in Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, and for methods for simulation from conditional distributions given sufficient statistics. This theory gives an alternative to ad hoc arguments without an underlying theory, and removes apparent paradoxes. Readers who acknowledge the need for a theoretical basis for statistical inference including improper priors are urged to consider the theory of conditional probability spaces as presented here.","Admissibility,Axioms of probability,Bayesian statistics,Conditional law,Marginalization paradox,Posterior propriety","INFERENCE,MODELS","Taraldsen, Gunnar@SINTEF Informat & Commun Technol, N-7465 Trondheim, Norway::Lindqvist, Bo Henry@Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Math Sci, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway","Taraldsen, Gunnar@SINTEF::Lindqvist, Bo Henry@Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU)@Norwegian University of Science & Technology",not exist,"Objective priors for the bivariate normal model+Berger, James O.; Sun, Dongchu+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2008::Posterior propriety and admissibility of hyperpriors in normal hierarchical models+Berger, JO; Strawderman, W; Tang, DJ+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2005::Conditioning as disintegration+Chang, JT; Pollard, D+STATISTICA NEERLANDICA+NOV 1997::MARGINALIZATION PARADOXES IN BAYESIAN AND STRUCTURAL INFERENCE+DAWID, AP; STONE, M; ZIDEK, JV+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1973::no title+EATON ML+FESTSCHRIFT HERMAN R+2004::no title+EATON ML+STAT DECISION THEORY+1982::Identifiability, improper priors, and Gibbs sampling for generalized linear models+Gelfand, AE; Sahu, K+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1999::no title+Halmos,, P.

A Note on Bayesian Inference After Multiple Imputation,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2010.09109,MAY 2010,9,17,"This article is aimed at practitioners who plan to use Bayesian inference on multiply-imputed datasets in settings where posterior distributions of the parameters of interest are not approximately Gaussian. We seek to steer practitioners away from a naive approach to Bayesian inference, namely estimating the posterior distribution in each completed dataset and averaging functionals of these distributions. We demonstrate that this approach results in unreliable inferences. A better approach is to mix draws from the posterior distributions from each completed dataset, and use the mixed draws to summarize the posterior distribution. Using simulations, we show that for this second approach to work well, the number of imputed datasets should be large. In particular, five to ten imputed datasets which is the standard recommendation for multiple imputation is generally not enough to result in reliable Bayesian inferences.","Missing,Nonresponse,Sample",,"Zhou, Xiang@Duke Univ, Dept Neurobiol, Durham, NC 27708 USA@Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA::Reiter, Jerome P.@Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Zhou, Xiang@Duke University::Reiter, Jerome P.@Duke University",not exist,"no title+Gelman, A; Carlin, JB; Sterns, HS<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Rubin, DB</span>.+Bayesian Data Analysis+2004::no title+Little, R.

Evidence suggests we have not met this challenge. In fact, Our traditional Stat 101 courses and texts can poison the statistical well for the people who become Our potential sponsors and collaborators. We need to do more than teach,methods.' We need to show from the first day and throughout the Stat101 experience that our methods exist to help people learn interesting things about issues and topics the), are passionate about. This message pertains to the rising generations of professionals and the citizenry at large and it applies to statisticians. Getting the message across may require radically redesigned 'service courses' and a new generation of uber-teachers as Meng (2009) advocated. In the meantime we should use existing materials in ways that show how subject-matter passion can motivate statistical analyses that reveal interesting and important subject-matter insights. As we develop new texts and other materials we need better quality control by authors, editors, and reviewers to assure that Our teaching Supports our ""first quantitative trainer"" responsibility.","Passion,Statistics,Stat101",STATISTICS,"Easterling, Robert G.@Unknow","Easterling, Robert G.@Unknow",not exist,"What Is Statistics?+Brown, Emery N.; Kass, Robert E.+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 2009::Teaching experimental design+Easterling, RG+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 2004::Life in a random universe+Efron, B.+AMSTAT News+December 2004::no title+GUNTER B+QUALITY PROGR    NOV+1988::Communicating Statistics and Developing Professionals: The 2008 ASA Presidential Address+Lachenbruch, Peter A.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2009::Desired and Feared-What Do We Do Now and Over the Next 50 Years?+Meng, Xiao-Li+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 2009::no title+Wild, CJ; Seber, GAF.+Chance Encounters+2000"

Moving the Statistics Profession Forward to the Next Level,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2010.09240,FEB 2010,19,12,"In an important and timely article Meng (2009) has raised important questions regarding the future of the statistics profession. We elaborate on several of his points and offer some additional opportunities for the profession to consider. We argue that statistical methods and tools must be properly integrated into an overall approach to scientific inquiry in order to be properly understood and utilized. The discipline of statistical engineering, defined in this article, provides a mechanism to do this based on research and theory. Similarly, statistical thinking provides a clear framework to help students understand the ""big picture"" of statistics, and a relevant context for its application. Further, there is a natural, synergistic linkage between statistical thinking, statistical engineering, and statistical methods. We believe that teaching this linkage to students and utilizing it widely ourselves will enable the profession to move forward to a higher level of impact.","Statistical education,Statistical engineering,Statistical thinking",THINKING,"Hoerl, Roger W.@GE Co, Global Res, Appl Stat Lab, Niskayuna, NY 12309 USA::Snee, Ronald D.@Snee Associates LLC, Newark, DE 19711 USA","Hoerl, Roger W.@General Electric::Snee, Ronald D.@Unknow",not exist,"no title+no author+Glossary and Tables for Statistical Quality Control+1996::What Is Statistics?+Brown, Emery N.; Kass, Robert E.+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 2009::no title+BRYCE GR+FORM C ROCH NY AUG 2+2004::Components of Statistical Thinking and Implications for Instruction and Assessment+Chance, B.+Journal of Statistics Education+2002::Teaching Statistics+Cobb, G.+Heeding the Call for Change: Suggestions for Curricular Action+1992::no title+Deming, W.

I approach my comments from these perspectives as I believe that these groups very much need to be represented/addressed in the discussion of Meng's observations and proposals. My remarks are also influenced by a Washington Post article published during the 2009 Joint Statistical Meetings that referred to statisticians as ""superheroes,"" described some of the challenges we face, and ultimately presented a favorable light (in my opinion) on Our discipline.","Introductory statistics,Statistical education,Two-year college,Undergraduate education",,"Kotz, Brian C.@Montgomery Coll, Germantown, MD 20876 USA","Kotz, Brian C.@Unknow",not exist,"What Is Statistics?+Brown, Emery N.; Kass, Robert E.+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 2009::Desired and Feared-What Do We Do Now and Over the Next 50 Years?+Meng, Xiao-Li+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 2009::New pedagogy and new content: The case of statistics+Moore, DS+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+AUG 1997"

It contains the revolutionary statement that science needs help and should be controlled by a police in order to prevent wrong discoveries. My response aims at further clarifying this statement, which seems to be necessary in view of the question 'What Do We Do Now and Over the Next 50 Years?'. The global warming, the financial crisis, and the international terrorism and wars show that something is wrong with the decision making processes in human societies. These deficiencies must be identified and removed. Science plays a key role in decision making, and according to Xiao-Li Meng science is characterized by a fundamental weakness with respect to thinking-or in other words with respect to approaching reality. He states: 'We statisticians, as a police of science, have the fundamental duty of helping others to engage in statistical thinking as a necessary step of scientific enquiry and evidence-based policy formulation.'

These confidence limits can be used to create plots of the normal densities consonant with the data. Exact confidence limits can also be easily derived for P(X > Y) and the odds of X being greater than Y. These latter two statistics can help us express t-test results in terms of differences between individuals randomly chosen from the two populations, rather than in terms of differences in population means.

In this article we shift focus from what we teach and how we teach to when we teach. We propose changes to the sequence in which core statistical concepts are presented in an introductory applied statistics course. The proposed ordering of topics repeats the sequence of descriptive summaries-probability theory-statistical inference several times throughout the course in various contexts.","Learning theory,Pedagogy of statistics,Statistics education",,"Malone, Christopher J.@Winona State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Winona, MN 55987 USA::Gabrosek, John@Grand Valley State Univ, Dept Stat, Allendale, MI 49401 USA::Curtiss, Phyllis@Grand Valley State Univ, Dept Stat, Allendale, MI 49401 USA::Race, Matt@Annapolis High Sch, Dearborn Hts, MI 48125 USA","Malone, Christopher J.@Winona State University::Gabrosek, John@Grand Valley State University::Curtiss, Phyllis@Grand Valley State University::Race, Matt@Unknow",not exist,"no title+Agresti, A.; Franklin, C.+Statistics: the Art and Science of Learning from Data+2007::no title+BALLMAN K+J STAT ED+1997::Components of Statistical Thinking and Implications for Instruction and Assessment+Chance, B.+Journal of Statistics Education+2002::no title+Chance, B.

A Model for an Interdisciplinary Undergraduate Research Program,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2010.09198,FEB 2010,13,5,"In the May 2009 issue of The American Statistician, Brown and Kass (BK) offered thought-provoking answers to the question ""What is Statistics?"" which have direct implications for statistics education. For five years, St. Olaf College's Center for Interdisciplinary Research's (CIR) activities have aligned with BK in both philosophy and practice. We describe the program's motivation and design, how we recruit Students and find faculty collaborators with suitable projects, and how the teams of faculty and students work together. A research skills seminar series parallels the research process and prepares students for working on teams. Inevitably, administrative issues arose which we identify and address. Landes (2009) identified significant issues related to recruiting. Our model of undergraduate education has proved to be fruitful on this front. Sending nearly 50 students to graduate school in five years from a college of fewer than 3000 speaks to the program's efficacy. Here we present a program based on authentic interdisciplinary research with undergraduates which embodies many of BK's ideas and addresses recruiting issues. Although this experience underscores the potential for new and exciting approaches to statistics education in the liberal arts environment, the model itself can be adapted by a variety of undergraduate programs.

Could It Be Better to Discard 90% of the Data? A Statistical Paradox,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2009.08205,FEB 2010,27,40,"Conventional practice is to draw inferences from all available data and research results. When a scientific literature is plagued by publication selection bias, a simple discarding of the vast majority of empirical results can actually improve statistical inference and estimation. Simulations demonstrate that, if statistical significance is used as a criterion for reporting or publishing estimates, discarding 90% of the published findings greatly reduces publication selection bias and is often more efficient than conventional summary statistics. Improving statistical estimation and inference through removing so much data goes against statistical theory and practice; hence, it is paradoxical. We investigate a very simple method to reduce the effects of publication bias and to improve the efficiency of summary estimates of accumulated empirical research results that averages the most precise 10% of the reported estimates (i.e., 'Top10'). In the process, the critical importance of precision (the inverse of an estimate's standard error) as a measure of a study's quality is brought to light. Reviewers and journal editors should use precision, when possible, as one objective measure of a study's quality.","Meta-regression analysis,Precision,Publication selection bias","PUBLICATION BIAS,VICE-VERSA,METAANALYSIS,SELECTION,DECISIONS,TESTS","Stanley, T.

Comparison of Software Algorithms for Calculating REML Wald Type Confidence Limits for the Between-Group Variance Component in a Small Sample One-Way Random Effects Model Example,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2009.08140,FEB 2010,16,1,"Confidence limits for variance components in mixed effects models can be readily estimated by procedures such as PROC MIXED (SAS (R)), MIXED (SPSS (R)), LME (S-PLUS (R)), and XTMIXED (Stata (R)). For a small sample unbalanced one-way random effects model case study, the REML Wald type confidence limits for the between-group variance obtained from PROC MIXED differ substantially from those from MIXED, LME, and XTMIXED. Simulations indicate that the Satterth-waite approximation used by PROC MIXED results in highly inflated confidence interval lengths, while the interval lengths from the other procedures are usually similar but also biased upward. The coverage rates of the confidence limits from all four procedures appear above the nominal value. Extreme upper limits and problems with computing the confidence limits are also possible, especially with PROC MIXED. In general, one should avoid the naive use of statistical software packages when estimating REML confidence limits for variance components with small datasets, and simulations can assist in examining the validity of the results.","LME,MIXED,PROC MIXED,REML,Simulation,Variance component,XTMIXED",INTERVAL ESTIMATION,"Lynn, Henry S.@Fudan Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China::Dong, Zhanjian@Roche Global Pharma Dev Ctr, Biometr Dept, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China::Mu, Zhe@Fudan Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China","Lynn, Henry S.@Fudan University::Dong, Zhanjian@Roche Holding::Mu, Zhe@Fudan University",not exist,"The present status of confidence interval estimation for one-factor random models+Burdick, Richard K.; Quiroz, Jorge; Iyer, Hariharan K.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+DEC 1 2006::Design and Analysis of Gauge R&amp;R Studies: Making Decisions with Confidence Intervals in Random and Mixed ANOVA Models+Burdick, RK; Borror, CM; Montgomery, DC+DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF GAUGE R&amp;R STUDIES: MAKING DECISIONS WITH CONFIDENCE INTERVALS IN RANDOM AND MIXED ANOVA MODELS+2005::Confidence intervals for the between group variance in the unbalanced one-way random effects model of analysis of variance+Hartung, J; Knapp, G+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+2000::Comparison of confidence intervals on the among-group variance component for the unbalanced one-way random model+Lee, JY; Khuri, AI+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+2002::Comparison of confidence intervals on the among group variance in the unbalanced variance component model+Li, Xinmin; Li, Guoying+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+2007::Confidence intervals on sum of variance components with unbalanced designs+Li, XM; Li, GY+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2005::no title+Littell, RC; Milliken, GA; Stroup, WW<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Wolfinger, RD; Schabenberger, O</span>.+SAS System for Mixed Models+2006::Performance of confidence intervals in regression models with unbalanced one-fold nested error structures+Park, DJ; Burdick, RK+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+2003::no title+Pinheiro, J.C.; Bates, D.M.+Mixed-Effects Models in S and S-PLUS+2000::no title+no author+SAS/STAT 9.1 User's Guide.

Rating Movies and Rating the Raters Who Rate Them,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2009.08278,NOV 2009,13,5,"The movie distribution company Netflix has generated considerable buzz in the statistics community by offering a million dollar prize for improvements to its movie rating system. Among the statisticians and computer scientists who have disclosed their techniques, the emphasis has been on machine learning approaches. This article has the modest goal of discussing a simple model for movie rating and other forms of democratic rating. Because the model involves a large number of parameters, it is nontrivial to carry out maximum likelihood estimation. Here we derive a straightforward EM algorithm from the perspective of the more general MM algorithm. The algorithm is capable of finding the global maximum on a likelihood landscape littered with inferior modes. We apply two variants of the model to a dataset from the MovieLens archive and compare their results. Our model identifies quirky raters, redefines the raw rankings, and permits imputation of missing ratings. The model is intended to stimulate discussion and development of better theory rather than to win the prize. It has the added benefit of introducing readers to some of the issues connected with analyzing high-dimensional data.","EM and MM algorithms,High-dimensional data,Maximum likelihood,Ranking",,"Zhou, Hua@Unknow::Lange, Kenneth@Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Biomath, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA@Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Human Genet, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA@Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Stat, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Zhou, Hua@Unknow::Lange, Kenneth@University of California Los Angeles@University of California System",not exist,"no title+*ACM SIGCHI+RECSYS 07 P 2007 ACM+2007::no title+no author+P KDD CUP WORKSH+2007::Toward the next generation of recommender systems: A survey of the state-of-the-art and possible extensions+Adomavicius, G; Tuzhilin, A+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING+JUN 2005::EM algorithms without missing data.+Becker, MP; Yang, I; Lange, K.+Stat Methods Med Res+1997::Block-relaxation algorithms in statistics+de Leeuw, J.+Information Systems and Data Analysis+1994::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::Convergent computing by iterative majorization: theory and applications in multidimensional data analysis+Heiser, W.

Variable Importance Assessment in Regression: Linear Regression versus Random Forest,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2009.08199,NOV 2009,40,137,"Relative importance of regressor variables is an old topic that still awaits a satisfactory solution. When interest is in attributing importance in linear regression, averaging over orderings methods for decomposing R-2 are among the state-of-the-art methods, although the mechanism behind their behavior is not (yet) completely understood. Random forests-a machine-learning tool for classification and regression proposed a few years ago-have an inherent procedure of producing variable importances. This article compares the two approaches (linear model on the one hand and two versions of random forests on the other hand) and finds both striking similarities and differences, some of which can be explained whereas others remain a challenge. The investigation improves understanding of the nature of variable importance in random forests.

A Fresh Look at the Discriminant Function Approach for Estimating Crude or Adjusted Odds Ratios,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2009.08246,NOV 2009,18,6,"Assuming a binary outcome, logistic regression is the most common approach to estimating a crude or adjusted odds ratio corresponding to a continuous predictor. We revisit a method termed the discriminant function approach, which leads to closed-form estimators and corresponding standard errors. In its most appealing application, we show that the approach suggests a multiple linear regression of the continuous predictor of interest on the outcome and other covariates, in place of the traditional logistic regression model. If standard diagnostics support the assumptions (including normality of errors) accompanying this linear regression model, the resulting estimator has demonstrable advantages over the usual maximum likelihood estimator via logistic regression. These include improvements in terms of bias and efficiency based on a minimum variance unbiased estimator of the log odds ratio, as well as the availability of an estimate when logistic regression fails to converge due to a separation of data points. Use of the discriminant function approach as described here for multivariable analysis requires less stringent assumptions than those for which it was historically criticized, and is worth considering when the adjusted odds ratio associated with a particular continuous predictor is of primary interest. Simulation and case studies illustrate these points.","Bias,Efficiency,Logistic regression,Minimum variance unbiased estimator","LOGISTIC-REGRESSION,RISK,DISEASE","Lyles, Robert H.@Emory Univ, Dept Biostat & Bioinformat, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA::Guo, Ying@Emory Univ, Dept Biostat & Bioinformat, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA::Hill, Andrew N.@Emory Univ, Dept Biostat & Bioinformat, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA","Lyles, Robert H.@Emory University::Guo, Ying@Emory University::Hill, Andrew N.@Emory University",not exist,"no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical Data Analysis+2002::Convergence problems in logistic regression+Allison, P; Altman, M; Gill, G<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; McDonald, MP</span>.+Numerical Issues in Statistical Computing for the Social Scientist+2004::QUADRATIC LOGISTIC DISCRIMINATION+ANDERSON, JA+BIOMETRIKA+1975::no title+Anderson, T.

Representation of Multiplicative Seasonal Vector Autoregressive Moving Average Models,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2009.08040,NOV 2009,15,2,"Time series often contain observations of several variables and multivariate time series models are used to represent the relationship between these variables. There are many studies on vector autoregressive moving average (VARMA) models, but the representation of multiplicative seasonal VARMA models has not been seriously studied. In a multiplicative vector model, such as a seasonal VARMA model, the representation is not unique because of the noncommutative property of matrix multiplication. In this article, we carefully examine the consequences of different model representations on parameter estimation and forecasting through numerical illustrations, simulation, and the analysis of a housing starts and housing sales dataset.","Estimation,Forecasting,Information criteria,Seasonality",,"Yozgatligil, Ceylan@Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Stat, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey::Wei, William W.

Examining Factors to Better Understand Autoregressive Models,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2009.08283,NOV 2009,13,0,"Most introductory time series analysis courses and texts designed for students in statistics, engineering, applied sciences, econometrics, and finance are sorely lacking when it comes to providing much depth of understanding about the basic features of the autoregressive (AR) model obtained for a realization. We show that factoring an AR model is useful for conveying information about the model, including stationarity as well as time and frequency domain information. While it is common practice to express models with unit roots or seasonal models in a factored form, we recommend factoring the stationary components of the model and using a factor table to summarize the information about model factors. We also discuss the decomposition of an AR realization into its additive components, which helps students visualize the information in the factor table. The factor table and decomposition can be used as teaching tools, so that students will no longer view the AR model as a ""black box"" from which to obtain forecasts, spectral estimates, and so on. We illustrate these techniques using an AR(9) model fit to the sunspot data. We provide a link to software that can be used in time series courses to implement the ideas discussed in the article.","Autocorrelations,Factor tables,Spectral density,Time series",TREND,"Woodward, Wayne A.@So Methodist Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Dallas, TX 75275 USA::Gray, Henry L.@So Methodist Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Dallas, TX 75275 USA::Haney, James R.@Unknow::Elliott, Alan C.@Unknow","Woodward, Wayne A.@Southern Methodist University::Gray, Henry L.@Southern Methodist University::Haney, James R.@Unknow::Elliott, Alan C.@Unknow",not exist,"NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::no title+Box, G.

Managing Case Discussions in Introductory Business Statistics Classes: Practical Approaches for Instructors,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2009.09053,NOV 2009,43,4,"Case discussions have become an integral component of our business statistics courses. We have discovered that case discussion adds enormous benefits to the classroom and learning experience of our students even in a quantitatively based course like statistics. As we read about discussion-based methods, we discovered that the literature is mostly silent about the specific challenges of case teaching in statistics courses. This article is an attempt to fill that void. It provides a ""how-to"" starter's guide for those interested in incorporating case discussions in statistics courses. It includes resources for background reading, tips on setting up a statistics case discussion course, and examples of four specific case discussions involving statistics topics. An illustrative case and instructor's notes that can be used on the first day of class are provided as well. Because we have had mixed reactions to conducting case discussions online, we believe that the use of case discussion in distance education statistics courses is a fruitful area for experimentation and research. Although our experience is in the business statistics classroom, this article is also applicable to statistics courses in other disciplines.","Case-based statistics courses,Classroom discussion,Communication skills,Interactive education,Managerial decision-making,Online learning communities,Technical courses",COURSES,"Smith, Marlene A.@Univ Colorado, Sch Business, Denver, CO 80217 USA::Bryant, Peter G.@Univ Colorado, Sch Business, Denver, CO 80217 USA","Smith, Marlene A.@University of Colorado System@University of Colorado Denver::Bryant, Peter G.@University of Colorado System@University of Colorado Denver",not exist,"COMPUTER-MEDIATED COLLABORATIVE LEARNING - AN EMPIRICAL-EVALUATION+ALAVI, M+MIS QUARTERLY+JUN 1994::Improving Case Discussion With an Improv Mind-Set+Aylesworth, Andy+JOURNAL OF MARKETING EDUCATION+AUG 2008::no title+Barnes, L.

The probability distribution of this random variable is derived utilizing various counting rules, properties of probability, and observing trends. The distribution involves the Stirling numbers of the second kind and some asymptotic results are given.

Coefficients of Determination in Logistic Regression Models-A New Proposal: The Coefficient of Discrimination,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2009.08210,NOV 2009,10,136,"Many analogues to the coefficient of determination R(2) in ordinary regression models have been proposed in the context of logistic regression. Our starting point is a study of three definitions related to quadratic measures of variation. We discuss the properties of these statistics, and show that the family can be extended in a natural way by a fourth statistic with an even simpler interpretation, namely the difference between the averages of fitted values for successes and failures, respectively. We propose the name ""the coefficient of discrimination"" for this statistic, and recommend its use as a standard measure of explanatory power. In its intuitive interpretation, this quantity has no immediate relation to the classical versions of R(2), but it turns out to be related to these by two exact relations, which imply that all these statistics are asymptotically equivalent.","Coefficient of determination,Explanatory power,Logistic regression,R-square",GOODNESS-OF-FIT,"Tjur, Tue@Copenhagen Sch Econ & Business Adm, Dept Finance, Ctr Stat, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark","Tjur, Tue@Copenhagen Business School",not exist,"An R-squared measure of goodness of fit for some common nonlinear regression models+Cameron, AC; Windmeijer, FAG+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+APR 1997::A COMMENT ON THE COEFFICIENT OF DETERMINATION FOR BINARY RESPONSES+COX, DR; WERMUTH, N+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+FEB 1992::no title+Cox, DR; Snell, EJ.+The Analysis of Binary Data+1989::no title+Hosmer, D; Lemeshow, S.+Applied logistic regression+2000::A comparison of goodness-of-fit tests for the logistic regression model+Hosmer, DW; Hosmer, T; leCessie, S; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+MAY 15 1997::CAUTIONARY NOTE ABOUT R2+KVALSETH, TO+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+1985::Coefficients of determination for multiple logistic regression analysis+Menard, S+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+FEB 2000::A NOTE ON A GENERAL DEFINITION OF THE COEFFICIENT OF DETERMINATION+NAGELKERKE, NJD+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1991::ON MEASURES OF MONOTONE-ASSOCIATION+RAVEH, A+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1986::Summarizing the predictive power of a generalized linear model+Zheng, BY; Agresti, A+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUL 15 2000"
A Note on B-Splines for Semiparametric Elicitation,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2009.08191,NOV 2009,11,2,"In this article we introduce a novel method for transferring expert statements about an uncertain bounded quantity into a probability distribution. This is a challenging problem, as these statements are usually sparse and imprecise: We will approach both issues by penalization, such that the final distribution will contain the stated information, but subject to that distributes its probability mass as uniformly as possible. As a functional basis for the modeled distribution we use linear combinations of B-splines. B-splines are highly flexible, have excellent shape-preserving properties, and are also well suited for evaluation, differentiation, and integration.

The Effective Sample Size and an Alternative Small-Sample Degrees-of-Freedom Method,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2009.08196,NOV 2009,19,39,"Correlated data frequently arise in contexts such as, for example, repeated measures and meta-analysis. The amount of information in such data depends not only on the sample size, but also on the structure and strength of the correlations among observations from the same independent block. A general concept is discussed, the effective sample size, as a way of quantifying the amount of information in such data. It is defined as the sample size one would need in an independent sample to equal the amount of information in the actual correlated sample. This concept is widely applicable, for Gaussian data and beyond, and provides important insight. For example, it helps explain why fixed-effects and random-effects inferences of meta-analytic data can be so radically divergent. Further, we show that in some cases the amount of information is bounded, even when the number of measures per independent block approaches infinity. We use the method to devise a new denominator degrees-of-freedom method for fixed-effects testing. It is compared to the classical Satterthwaite and Kenward-Roger methods for performance and, more importantly, to enhance insight. A key feature of the proposed degrees-of-freedotn method is that it, unlike the others, can be used for non-Gaussian data, too.

Desired and Feared-What Do We Do Now and Over the Next 50 Years?,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2009.09045,AUG 2009,8,29,"An intense debate about Harvard University's General Education Curriculum demonstrates that statistics, as a discipline, is now both desired and feared. With this new status comes a set of enormous challenges. We no longer simply enjoy the privilege of playing in or cleaning up everyone's backyard. We are now being invited into everyone's study or living room, and trusted with the task of being their offspring's first quantitative nanny. Are we up to such a nerve-wracking task, given the insignificant size of our profession relative to the sheer number of our hosts and their progeny? Echoing Brown and Kass's ""What Is Statistics?"" (2009), this article further suggests ways to prepare our profession to meet the ever-increasing demand, in terms of both quantity and quality. Discussed are (1) the need to supplement our graduate curricula with a professional development curriculum (PDC); (2) the need to develop more subject oriented statistics (SOS) courses and happy courses at the undergraduate level; (3) the need to have the most qualified statisticians-in terms of both teaching and research credentials-to teach introductory statistical courses, especially those for other disciplines; (4) the need to deepen our foundation while expanding our horizon in both teaching and research; and (5) the need to greatly increase the general awareness and avoidance of unprincipled data analysis methods, through our practice and teaching, as a way to combat ""incentive bias,"" a main culprit of false discoveries in science, misleading information in media, and misguided policies in society.","Communication skills,General education curriculum,Graduate education,Incentive bias,Statistical education,Undergraduate education",STATISTICS,"Meng, Xiao-Li@Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Meng, Xiao-Li@Harvard University",not exist,"What Is Statistics?+Brown, Emery N.; Kass, Robert E.+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 2009::no title+CASSIDY S+C GSAS ALUMMI Q  WIN+2009::no title+CRAIU R+IMS B            APR+2009::no title+GARFIELD J+WORKSH FUND ASA MEMB+2009::no title+HANLON M+10 QUESTIONS SCI CAN+2007::Teaching of statistics+Hotelling, H+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1940::no title+MENG XL+ANNSTAT NEWS     AUG+2008::no title+MENG XL+OP ED HARVARD UN SPR+2009"
A Selection Bias Conflict and Frequentist versus Bayesian Viewpoints,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2009.08243,AUG 2009,15,3,"In many branches of modern science, researchers first study or mine large datasets, and then select the parameters they estimate and the data they use and publish. Such data-based selection complicates formal statistical inference. An example discussed here for the purpose of illustration, is that of pharmaceutical companies that typically conduct many experiments but may publish only selected data. The selection often depends on the outcomes of the experiments since naturally there is interest in potentially useful drugs, and it is in general unclear how it should affect inference. Is this effect the same for the company and the public? Does it matter if they are Bayesian or frequentist? Should the company reveal all experiments it conducts and, if so, how should this change the conclusions'?

This note discusses these questions in terms of a simple example of a sequence of binomial experiments conducted by a pharmaceutical company, where results are published only if the number of ""failures"" is small. We do not suggest that this example corresponds to reality in the pharmaceutical industry, nor in science in general; our goal is to elaborate on the importance and difficulties of taking selection into account when performing statistical analysis.","Binomial model,Confidence interval,Credible set,Decision theory,Meta analysis,Publication bias",CONFIDENCE,"Mandel, Micha@Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Stat, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel::Rinott, Yosef@Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Stat, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel@Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Ctr Study Rational, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel","Mandel, Micha@Hebrew University of Jerusalem::Rinott, Yosef@Hebrew University of Jerusalem",not exist,"False discovery rate-adjusted multiple confidence intervals for selected parameters+Benjamini, Y; Yekutieli, D+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2005::no title+Berger, J.+Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis+1985::Interval estimation for a binomial proportion - Comment - Rejoinder+Brown, LD; Cai, TT; DasGupta, A; et al.+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 2001::no title+CLEARY R+J EDUC BEHAV STAT+1995::The use of confidence or fiducial limits illustrated in the case of the binomial.+Clopper, CJ; Pearson, ES+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1934::no title+DAWID AP+MULTIVARIATE ANAL IT+1994::no title+Ferguson, T.+Mathematical statistics, a decision theoretic approach+1967::Selection Models and the File Drawer Problem+Iyengar, Shanto; Greenhouse, Joel B.+Statistical Science+1988::no title+Lehmann, E.L.+Testing Statistical Hypotheses+1991::INFERENCE FOR A BERNOULLI PROCESS (A BAYESIAN VIEW)+LINDLEY, DV; PHILLIPS, LD+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+1976::no title+MANDEL M+473 U JER CTR STUD R+2007::Reporting mortality findings in trials of rofecoxib for Alzheimer disease or cognitive impairment - A case study based on documents from rofecoxib litigation+Psaty, Bruce M.; Kronmal, Richard A.+JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION+APR 16 2008::THE FILE DRAWER PROBLEM AND TOLERANCE FOR NULL RESULTS+ROSENTHAL, R+PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN+1979::Publication Bias in Meta-Analysis+Rothstein, Hannah R.; Sutton, Alexander J.; Borenstein, Michael+PUBLICATION BIAS IN META-ANALYSIS: PREVENTION, ASSESSMENT AND ADJUSTMENTS+2005::A note concerning a selection ""Paradox"" of Dawid's+Senn, Stephen+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 2008"
A Regression Paradox for Linear Models: Sufficient Conditions and Relation to Simpson's Paradox,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2009.08220,AUG 2009,16,3,"An analysis of customer survey data using direct and reverse linear regression leads to inconsistent conclusions with respect to the effect of a group variable. This counterintuitive phenomenon, called the ""regression paradox,"" causes seemingly contradictory group effects when the predictor and regressand are interchanged. Using analytical developments as well as geometric arguments, we describe sufficient conditions under which the regression paradox will appear in linear Gaussian models. The results show that the phenomenon depends on a distribution shift between the groups relative to the predictability of the model. As a consequence, the paradox can appear naturally in certain distributions, and may not be caused by sampling error or incorrectly specified models. Simulations verify that the paradox may appear in more general, non-Gaussian settings. An interesting, geometric connection to Simpson's paradox is provided.","Group effect,Monotone regression,Regression paradox,Reverse regression,Simpson's paradox","REVERSE REGRESSION,EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION","Chen, Aiyou@Unknow::Bengtsson, Thomas@Unknow::Ho, Tin Kam@Unknow","Chen, Aiyou@Unknow::Bengtsson, Thomas@Unknow::Ho, Tin Kam@Unknow",not exist,"no title+ARAH O+EMERGING THEMES EPID+2008::SEX BIAS IN GRADUATE ADMISSIONS - DATA FROM BERKELEY+BICKEL, PJ; HAMMEL, EA; OCONNELL, JW+SCIENCE+1975::ROBUST LOCALLY WEIGHTED REGRESSION AND SMOOTHING SCATTERPLOTS+CLEVELAND, WS+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1979::no title+CONWAY DA+J BUSINESS EC STAT+1984::no title+GENG Z+CHINESE J DIS CONTRO+2006::REVERSE REGRESSION AND SALARY DISCRIMINATION+GOLDBERGER, AS+JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCES+1984::EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION - AN EMPIRICAL-TEST OF FORWARD VERSUS REVERSE REGRESSION+GREEN, CA; FERBER, MA+JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCES+1984::Statistics and causal inference+Holland, P.+JASA+1986::no title+HOLLAND PW+PRINCIPALS MODERN PS+1998::A PARADOX IN INTERPRETATION OF GROUP COMPARISONS+LORD, FM+PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN+1967::THE REVERSE REGRESSION PROBLEM - STATISTICAL PARADOX OR ARTIFACT OF MISSPECIFICATION+RACINE, J; RILSTONE, P+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS-REVUE CANADIENNE D ECONOMIQUE+AUG 1995::Reverse Regression, Fairness, and Employment Discrimination+Roberts, H.

Greenhouse-Geisser Adjustment and the ANOVA-Type Statistic: Cousins or Twins?,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2009.08187,AUG 2009,37,15,"Geisser and Greenhouse described a method for repeated measures analysis of variance that has become an important part of statistical tradition. The Greenhouse-Geisser method is based on work of Box, who studied the effects of dependence on the sampling distribution of analysis of variance F ratios and derived adjustments to the degrees of freedom. In separate work on deriving small sample approximations for linear rank statistics in factorial designs, Brunner et al. proposed an F approximation with estimated degrees of freedom based on Box's method of matching moments. In this article we show that these two descendent lines of research, although apparently divergent., actually converge for important special cases. This convergence indicates the close theoretical and practical relationships between the ANOVA-type statistic and the Greenhouse-Geisser F adjustment, which has the useful consequence that software implementations of the latter also can be used to perk form many of the nonparametric tests discussed by Brunner and Puri. Furthermore, the connection indicates that further work and improvements in each area may be useful in the other areas.","Analysis of variance,Dependent data,Repeated measures","REPEATED-MEASURES DESIGNS,BROWN-FORSYTHE PROCEDURE,FACTORIAL-DESIGNS,MIXED MODELS,TESTS,POWER","Bathke, Arne C.@Univ Kentucky, Dept Stat, Lexington, KY 40506 USA::Schabenberger, Oliver@Unknow::Tobias, Randall D.@SAS Inst Inc, Cary, NC 27513 USA::Madden, Laurence V.@Ohio State Univ, Dept Plant Pathol, Wooster, OH 44691 USA","Bathke, Arne C.@University of Kentucky::Schabenberger, Oliver@Unknow::Tobias, Randall D.@Unknow::Madden, Laurence V.@Ohio State University",not exist,"Analysis of high-dimensional repeated measures designs: The one sample case+Ahmad, M.

This can be caused by underlying skewness of data, generating both bias and skewness of the pivotal and leading to, for example, confidence intervals with poorer coverage properties, especially for one-sided intervals. We present in a general setting a simple, yet effective procedure that takes into account this correlation and leads to alternative adjusted intervals with more appealing coverage properties.

We begin by reviewing the research oil people's inability to perceive and understand both random and nonrandom behavior. Probability models are then developed, under the assumption of a random shuffle, for several of the most common types of events cited as evidence of a nonrandom shuffle. Under this null hypothesis of a random shuffle, several goodness-of-fit tests of one of the probability models are conducted using data collected front real iPods. No evidence to support user claims of a nonrandom shuffle was found.

The Island Problem Revisited,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2009.08107,AUG 2009,9,0,"Here I revisit the so-called ""island problem"" in forensic statistics. The problem is how to properly update the probability of guilt when a suspect is found that has the same characteristics as a culprit. In particular, how should the search protocol be accounted for? I present the established results of the literature and extend them by considering the selection effect resulting from a protocol in which only cases with a suspect reach the court. I find that the updated probability of guilt is shifted when properly accounting for the selection effect. Which way this shift goes depends on the exact distribution of all potential characteristics in the population. The shift is only marginal in numerical examples that have any resemblance to real-world forensic cases. The island problem illustrates the general point that the exact protocol through which data are generated is an essential part of the information set that should be used when analyzing nonexperimental data.","Bayesian method,Collins case,Forensic statistics",FORENSIC IDENTIFICATION,"Mehlum, Halvor@Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, Oslo, Norway","Mehlum, Halvor@University of Oslo",not exist,"INFERENCE IN FORENSIC IDENTIFICATION+BALDING, DJ; DONNELLY, P+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1995::The island problem: coherent use of identification evidence+Dawid, A.+Aspects of Uncertainty: A Tribute to D.V.

Some Suggestions for Teaching About Normal Approximations to Poisson and Binomial Distribution Functions,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2009.08147,AUG 2009,11,7,"In this article we review two historical approximations to the Poisson and binomial cumulative distribution functions (CDFs); that is, the Wilson-Hilferty and Camp-Paulson approximations. Both of these approximations reduce to standard normal formulas that produce very accurate estimates of the Poisson and binomial CDFs, and are thus quite simple to implement. Additionally, in an upper-division undergraduate or master's level probability and inference course, the derivation of these approximations presents a nice opportunity to introduce and study the distributional relationships between the gamma and Poisson CDFs, and the binomial, beta, and F CDFs. This article presents the basic theorems and lemmas needed to derive each approximation, along with some relevant examples that compare and contrast the precision of these approximations with their large-sample, limiting normal counterparts.","Camp-Paulson approximation,Distributional relationships,Normal approximation,Wilson-Hilferty approximation","TAIL PROBABILITIES,F BETA","Lesch, Scott M.@Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Stat, Riverside, CA 92521 USA::Jeske, Daniel R.@Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Stat, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Lesch, Scott M.@University of California System@University of California Riverside::Jeske, Daniel R.@University of California System@University of California Riverside",not exist,"no title+CAMP BH+ANN MATH STAT+1995::no title+Casella, G.; Berger, R.+Statistical Inference+2002::A note on improved approximation of the binomial distribution by the skew-normal distribution+Chang, Ching-Hui; Lin, Jyh-Jiuan; Pal, Nabendu; et al.+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 2008::The distribution of the index in a normal bivariate population.+Fieller, EC+BIOMETRIKA+NOV 1932::The frequency distribution of the quotient of two normal variates+Geary, RC+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY+1930::no title+Johnson, NL; Kotz, S.+Discrete distributions+1969::An approximate normalization of the analysis of variance distribution+Paulson, E+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1942::A NORMAL APPROXIMATION FOR BINOMIAL F BETA AND OTHER COMMON RELATED TAIL PROBABILITIES .I.+PEIZER, DB; PRATT, JW+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1968::A NORMAL APPROXIMATION FOR BINOMIAL F BETA AND OTHER COMMON RELATED TAIL PROBABILITIES .2.+PRATT, JW+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1968::2 RULES OF THUMB FOR THE APPROXIMATION OF THE BINOMIAL-DISTRIBUTION BY THE NORMAL-DISTRIBUTION+SCHADER, M; SCHMID, F+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+FEB 1989::The distribution of chi square+Wilson, EB; Hilferty, MM+PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA+1931"
A New Way to Derive Locally Most Powerful Rank Tests,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2009.08244,AUG 2009,6,1,"The standard way to derive locally most powerful rank tests in nonparametrics involves differentiation of the rank likelihood, which is a complicated integral, and the proof is typically quite long and technical. By treating the ranks as the observed data and the underlying continuous random variables as the ""complete"" data, we are able to give a quick derivation of locally most powerful rank tests by using a well-known relationship between the derivatives of the log-likelihoods of the observed and ""complete"" data, which can be either assumed known or derived from first principles in a few lines. Along with shortening the proof considerably, this proposed approach has two other advantages. First, it allows students to see that the locally most powerful rank test is just a special case of the locally most powerful test based on the efficient score (i.e., the derivative of the log-likelihood), a topic often covered in a first-year graduate course in mathematical statistics. Second, it allows students to gain the perspective of viewing a rank test as an case of inference based on incomplete data. As a novel application, the proposed approach is used to derive a new rank test based on the difference between the Savage score and the Wilcoxon score. The new test is useful in testing for a difference in two survival distributions with a time-varying hazard ratio.","Complete data,Hazard ratio,Locally most powerful test,Savage test.,Score function,Wilcoxon test",,"Kuk, Anthony Y.

Assessing Judging Bias: An Example From the 2000 Olympic Games,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2009.0026,MAY 2009,6,12,"Judging bias is an inherent risk in subjectively judged sporting competitions, and recent controversies have spurred researchers to explore these biases wherever possible. Unfortunately, detailed judging results are usually unavailable to the public. For example, the international figure skating scoring system does not allow the study of nationalistic bias, because the scores are reported anonymously. Similarly, the National Basketball Association (NBA) blocked requests for underlying data after a recent academic study of racial bias of NBA referees. This article makes use of a rare case of fully available judging data, examining the diving competitions from the 2000 Summer Olympic Games. We discover strong evidence of nationalistic favoritism in the judging, including one case where the medal standings reasonably could have changed with unbiased judging.

Statistical Accuracy of iPad Applications: An Initial Examination,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2013.778789,MAY 2013,12,0,"With the recent advent of the iPad, statistics-related applications (apps) have begun development. Given their newness, statistical accuracy is a concern. This study assessed the accuracy of the following iPad apps: Data Explorer, StatsMate, Statistics Visualizer, and TC-Stats. Early and recent versions of Excel were also included for comparative purposes. Accuracy was considered in two ways. First, the National Institute of Standards and Technology Statistical Reference Datasets (StRD) were used to benchmark accuracy. Analyses included univariate summary statistics (means, standard deviations), analysis of variance (ANOVA; F statistics), and linear regression (regression coefficients, standard deviations). The log relative error was computed for each dataset (comparing the ""certified"" values from StRD against the app actual values). Second, Wilkinson's tests were conducted to assess app ""pass"" rates (rounding, scatterplot, univariate, regression, overall). The results suggest the following: (a) the most accurate app for summary statistics and for lower difficulty ANOVA datasets was StatsMate, (b) the most accurate app for average difficulty ANOVA datasets was Data Explorer, (c) no app was accurate for higher difficulty ANOVA datasets, (d) only Data Explorer could handle most regression models, and (e) Wilkinson pass rates for Data Explorer (79%) and StatsMate (58%) were highest. Overall, StatsMate compares favorably to Excel 97, early versions being similarly accurate. Much remains to be done to improve the statistical accuracy of these apps.","Data Explorer,Software accuracy,StatsMate,StatViz,StRD,TC-Stats","SOFTWARE,RELIABILITY","Lomax, Richard G.@Ohio State Univ, Coll Educ & Human Ecol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Lomax, Richard G.@Ohio State University","Lomax, Richard@F-9356-2012::Lomax, Richard@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6446-7679","Statistical Accuracy of Spreadsheet Software+Keeling, K.

In Bayesian applications, the common practice of sampling from posterior distributions is inefficient for rare event estimation when some parameters are important, and corresponding normalized estimates can be seriously biased for seemingly adequate sample sizes (e.g., N = 10(6)). Rare event estimation based on adaptive importance sampling can improve computational efficiencies by orders of magnitude relative to ordinary simulation methods, greatly reducing the need for time-consuming code runs.","Computer experiments,Gaussian process,Importance sampling,Percentile estimation,Quantile estimation,Sequential experimental design","DIAGNOSTICS,SIMULATION,CODE","Picard, Rick@Unknow::Williams, Brian@Unknow","Picard, Rick@Unknow::Williams, Brian@Unknow",not exist,"Estimation of small failure probabilities in high dimensions by subset simulation+Au, SK; Beck, JL+PROBABILISTIC ENGINEERING MECHANICS+OCT 2001::Exponential convergence of adaptive importance sampling for Markov chains+Baggerly, K; Cox, D; Picard, R+JOURNAL OF APPLIED PROBABILITY+JUN 2000::Diagnostics for Gaussian Process Emulators+Bastos, Leonardo S.; O'Hagan, Anthony+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 2009::Using Statistical and Computer Models to Quantify Volcanic Hazards+Bayarri, M.

In this article, we propose a Bayesian simulation-based approach to explore the behavior of the posterior distributions of these eigenvalues. Highest posterior density (HPD) intervals for the ordered eigenvalues are then computed and their empirical coverage probabilities are evaluated. A user-friendly software tool has been developed to get the kernel density plots of these simulated posterior distributions and to obtain the corresponding HPD intervals.

A Few Counter Examples Useful in Teaching Central Limit Theorems,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2012.755361,FEB 2013,15,1,"In probability theory, central limit theorems (CLTs), broadly speaking, state that the distribution of the sum of a sequence of random variables (r.v.'s), suitably normalized, converges to a normal distribution as their number n increases indefinitely. However, the preceding convergence in distribution holds only under certain conditions, depending on the underlying probabilistic nature of this sequence of r.v.'s. If some of the assumed conditions are violated, the convergence may or may not hold, or if it does, this convergence may be to a nonnormal distribution. We shall illustrate this via a few counter examples. While teaching CLTs at an advanced level, counter examples can serve as useful tools for explaining the true nature of these CLTs and the consequences when some of the assumptions made are violated.","Cauchy distribution,Laplace distribution,Logistic distribution,Sample mean,Sum of random variables,Uniform distribution",,"Bagui, Subhash C.@Univ W Florida, Dept Math & Stat, Pensacola, FL 32514 USA::Bhaumik, Dulal K.@Univ Illinois, Dept Biostat & Psychiat, Chicago, IL 60612 USA::Mehra, K.

The Equivalence of Neyman Optimum Allocation for Sampling and Equal Proportions for Apportioning the US House of Representatives,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2012.733679,NOV 2012,13,4,"We present a surprising though obvious result that seems to have been unnoticed until now. In particular, we demonstrate the equivalence of two well-known problems-the optimal allocation of the fixed overall sample size n among L strata under stratified random sampling and the optimal allocation of the H = 435 seats among the 50 states for apportionment of the U.S. House of Representatives following each decennial census. In spite of the strong similarity manifest in the statements of the two problems, they have not been linked and they have well-known but different solutions; one solution is not explicitly exact (Neyman allocation), and the other (equal proportions) is exact. We give explicit exact solutions for both and note that the solutions are equivalent. In fact, we conclude by showing that both problems are special cases of a general problem. The result is significant for stratified random sampling in that it explicitly shows how to minimize sampling error var((T) over cap (Y)) when estimating a total T-Y while keeping the final overall sample size fixed at n; this is usually not the case in practice with Neyman allocation where the resulting final overall sample size might be near n + L after rounding. An example reveals that controlled rounding with Neyman allocation does not always lead to the optimum allocation, that is, an allocation that minimizes variance.","Apportionment,Fractional parts,Neyman allocation,Probability sampling,Stratification",,"Wright, Tommy@US Bur Census, Ctr Stat Res & Methodol, Washington, DC 20233 USA@Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA","Wright, Tommy@Georgetown University",not exist,"no title+Balinski, M.

A Remark on the Alternative Expectation Formula,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2012.726934,NOV 2012,18,2,"Students in their first course in probability will often see the expectation formula for nonnegative continuous random variables in terms of the survival function. The traditional approach for deriving this formula (using double integrals) is well-received by students. Some students tend to approach this using integration by parts, but often get stuck. Most standard textbooks do not elaborate on this alternative approach. We present a rigorous derivation here. We hope that students and instructors of the first course in probability will find this short note helpful.","Expectation,Harmonic analysis,Integration by parts,Nonnegative continuous random variable,Survival function",,"Hong, Liang@Bradley Univ, Dept Math, Peoria, IL 61625 USA","Hong, Liang@Unknow",not exist,"no title+Bean, M.

A New Estimator of the Variance Based on Minimizing Mean Squared Error,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2012.735209,NOV 2012,10,1,"In 2005, Yatracos constructed the estimator S-2(2) = c(2)S(2), c(2) = (n + 2)(n - 1)[n(n + 1)](-1), of the variance, which has smaller mean squared error (MSE) than the unbiased estimator S-2. In this work, the estimator S-1(2) = c(1)S(2), c(1) = n(n - 1)[n(n - 1) + 2](-1), is constructed and is shown to have the following properties: (a) it has smaller MSE than S-2(2), and (b) it cannot be improved in terms of MSE by an estimator of the form cS(2), c > 0. The method of construction is based on Stein's classical idea brought forward in 1964, is very simple, and may be taught even in an undergraduate class. Also, all the estimators of the form cS(2), c > 0, with smaller MSE than S-2 as well as all those that have the property (b) are found. In contrast to S-2, the method of moments estimator is among the latter estimators.","Admissibility,Stein's method,Variance estimation",INADMISSIBILITY,"Kourouklis, Stavros@Univ Patras, Dept Math, Patras 26504, Greece","Kourouklis, Stavros@University of Patras",not exist,"IMPROVING ON EQUIVARIANT ESTIMATORS+BREWSTER, JF; ZIDEK, JV+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1974::INADMISSIBILITY OF USUAL ESTIMATORS OF SCALE PARAMETERS IN PROBLEMS WITH UNKNOWN LOCATION AND SCALE PARAMETERS+BROWN, L+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1968::Developments in decision-theoretic variance estimation+Maatta, J.

Estimation of Progression-Free Survival for All Treated Patients in the Randomized Discontinuation Trial Design,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2012.720900,AUG 2012,19,3,"The randomized discontinuation trial (RDT) design is an enrichment-type design that has been used in a variety of diseases to evaluate the efficacy of new treatments. The RDT design seeks to select a more homogeneous group of patients, consisting of those who are more likely to show a treatment benefit if one exists. In oncology, the RDT design has been applied to evaluate the effects of cytostatic agents, that is, drugs that act primarily by slowing tumor growth rather than shrinking tumors. In the RDT design, all patients receive treatment during an initial, open-label run-in period of duration T Patients with objective response (substantial tumor shrinkage) remain on therapy while those with early progressive disease are removed from the trial. Patients with stable disease (SD) are then randomized to either continue active treatment or switched to placebo. The main analysis compares outcomes, for example, progression-free survival (PFS), between the two randomized arms. As a secondary objective, investigators may seek to estimate PFS for all treated patients, measured from the time of entry into the study, by combining information from the run-in and post run-in periods. For t <= T. PFS is estimated by the observed proportion of patients who are progression-free among all patients enrolled. For t > T, the estimate can be expressed as (S) over cap (1) = (P) over cap (OR) x (S) over cap (OR)(t - T) + (P) over cap (SD) x (S) over cap (SD)(t - T), where (P) over cap (OR) is the estimated probability of response during the run-in period, Psi) is the estimated probability of SD, and (S) over cap (OR)(t - T) and (S) over cap (SD)(t - T) are the Kaplan-Meier estimates of subsequent PFS in the responders and patients with SD randomized to continue treatment, respectively. In this article, we derive the variance of (S) over cap (t), enabling the construction of confidence intervals for both (S) over cap (t) and the median survival time. Simulation results indicate that the method provides accurate coverage rates. An interesting aspect of the design is that outcomes during the run-in phase have a negative multinomial distribution, something not frequently encountered in practice.","Confidence limits,Enrichment design,Negative multinomial distribution,Phase II clinical trials","RENAL-CELL CARCINOMA,ENRICHMENT STRATEGIES,AGENTS,POWER,TIME","Karrison, Theodore G.@Univ Chicago, Dept Hlth Studies, Chicago, IL 60637 USA::Ratain, Mark J.@Univ Chicago, Dept Med, Chicago, IL 60637 USA::Stadler, Walter M.@Univ Chicago, Dept Med, Chicago, IL 60637 USA::Rosner, Gary L.@Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Med, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Karrison, Theodore G.@University of Chicago::Ratain, Mark J.@University of Chicago::Stadler, Walter M.@University of Chicago::Rosner, Gary L.@Johns Hopkins University",not exist,"no title+Bishop, YMM; Fienberg, SF; Holland, PW.+Discrete Multivariate Analysis+1975::A CONFIDENCE-INTERVAL FOR THE MEDIAN SURVIVAL-TIME+BROOKMEYER, R; CROWLEY, J+BIOMETRICS+1982::Comparing the power of the discontinuation design to that of the classic randomized design on time-to-event endpoints+Capra, WB+CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS+APR 2004::Sorafenib in advanced clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma+Escudier, Bernard; Eisen, Tim; Stadler, Walter M.; et al.+NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE+JAN 11 2007::Evaluation of randomized discontinuation design+Freidlin, B; Simon, R+JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY+AUG 1 2005::Comparison of Power Between Randomized Discontinuation Design and Upfront Randomization Design on Progression-Free Survival+Fu, Pingfu; Dowlati, Afshin; Schluchter, Mark+JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY+SEP 1 2009::ON A METHOD OF ESTIMATING FREQUENCIES+HALDANE, JBS+BIOMETRIKA+1945::NONPARAMETRIC-ESTIMATION FROM INCOMPLETE OBSERVATIONS+KAPLAN, EL; MEIER, P+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1958::no title+Klein, JP; Moeschberger, ML.+Survival analysis: techniques for censored and truncated data+1997::RANDOMIZED DISCONTINUATION TRIALS - UTILITY AND EFFICIENCY+KOPEC, JA; ABRAHAMOWICZ, M; ESDAILE, JM+JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY+SEP 1993::Clinical trial designs for cytostatic agents: Are new approaches needed?+Korn, EL; Arbuck, SG; Pluda, JM; et al.+JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY+JAN 1 2001::Threats to the validity of clinical trials employing enrichment strategies for sample selection+Leber, PD; Davis, CS+CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS+APR 1998::CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS FOR THE SURVIVAL FUNCTION USING COX PROPORTIONAL-HAZARD MODEL WITH COVARIATES+LINK, CL+BIOMETRICS+1984::DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CLINICAL-TRIALS REQUIRING PROLONGED OBSERVATION OF EACH PATIENT .2.

A Simulation-Based Evaluation of the Asymptotic Power Formulas for Cox Models in Small Sample Cases,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2012.703873,AUG 2012,8,4,"Cox proportional hazards (PH) models are commonly used in medical research to investigate the associations between covariates and time-to-event outcomes. It is frequently noted that with less than 10 events per covariate, these models produce spurious results and therefore should not be used. Statistical literature contains asymptotic power formulas for the Cox model which can be used to determine the number of events needed to detect an association. Here, we investigate via simulations the performance of these formulas in small sample settings for Cox models with one or two covariates. Our simulations indicate that when the number of events is small, the power estimate based on the asymptotic formula is often inflated. The discrepancy between the asymptotic and empirical power is larger for the dichotomous covariate especially in cases where allocation of sample size to its levels is unequal. When more than one covariate is included in the same model, the discrepancy between the asymptotic power and the empirical power is even larger, especially when a high positive correlation exists between the two covariates.","Cox proportional hazards model,Event size formula,Number of events per covariate,Time-to-event data","HAZARDS REGRESSION-MODEL,SIZE FORMULA,EVENTS","Kocak, Mehmet@Univ Tennessee, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Prevent Med, Memphis, TN 38105 USA::Onar-Thomas, Arzu@St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Dept Biostat, Memphis, TN 38105 USA","Kocak, Mehmet@University of Tennessee System@University of Tennessee Health Science Center::Onar-Thomas, Arzu@St Jude Children's Research Hospital","Onar-Thomas, Arzu@M-9356-2018::Kocak, Mehmet@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3386-1734","Survival Analysis Part III: Multivariate data analysis - choosing a model and assessing its adequacy and fit+Bradburn, MJ; Clark, TG; Love, SB; et al.+BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER+AUG 18 2003::Importance of events per independent variable in proportional hazards analysis .1.

Hidden Dangers of Specifying Noninformative Priors,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2012.695938,MAY 2012,22,19,"""Noninformative"" priors are widely used in Bayesian inference. Diffuse priors are often placed on parameters that are components of some function of interest. That function may, of course, have a prior distribution that is highly informative, in contrast to the joint prior placed on its arguments, resulting in unintended influence on the posterior for the function. This problem is not always recognized by users of ""noninformative"" priors. We consider several examples of this problem.

Regressograms and Mean-Covariance Models for Incomplete Longitudinal Data,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2012.695935,MAY 2012,18,2,"Longitudinal studies are prevalent in biological and social sciences where subjects are measured repeatedly over time. Modeling the correlations and handling missing data are among the most challenging problems in analyzing such data. There are various methods for handling missing data, but data-based and graphical methods for modeling the covariance matrix of longitudinal data are relatively new. We adopt an approach based on the modified Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix which handles both challenges. It amounts to formulating parametric models for the regression coefficients of the conditional mean and variance of each measurement given its predecessors. We demonstrate the roles of profile plots and regressograms in formulating joint mean-covariance models for incomplete longitudinal data. Applying these graphical tools to the Fruit Fly Mortality (FFM) data, which has 22% missing values, reveals a logistic curve for the mean function and two different models for the two factors of the modified Cholesky decomposition of the sample covariance matrix. An expectation-maximization algorithm is proposed for estimating the parameters of the mean-covariance models; it performs well for the FFM data and in a simulation study of incomplete longitudinal data.","Covariance structure,Expectation-maximization,Graphical tools,Missing data,Regressograms","MISSING DATA,EM ALGORITHM,MATRICES","Garcia, Tanya P.@Texas A&M Univ, Dept Stat, College Stn, TX 77843 USA::Kohli, Priya@Texas A&M Univ, Dept Stat, College Stn, TX 77843 USA::Pourahmadi, Mohsen@Texas A&M Univ, Dept Stat, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Garcia, Tanya P.@Texas A&M University System@Texas A&M University College Station::Kohli, Priya@Texas A&M University System@Texas A&M University College Station::Pourahmadi, Mohsen@Texas A&M University System@Texas A&M University College Station",not exist,"Two graphical techniques useful in detecting correlation structure in repeated measures data+Dawson, KS; Gennings, C; Carter, WH+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 1997::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::no title+Fitzmaurice, GM; Laird, NM; Ware, JH.+Applied Longitudinal Analysis+2004::Computing the nearest correlation matrix - a problem from finance+Higham, NJ+IMA JOURNAL OF NUMERICAL ANALYSIS+JUL 2002::A Cautionary Note on Generalized Linear Models for Covariance of Unbalanced Longitudinal Data+Huang, J.; Chen, M.; Maadooliat, M<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Pourahmadi, M</span>.+Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference+2011::ML estimation of mean and covariance structures with missing data using complete data routines+Jamshidian, M; Bentler, PM+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL STATISTICS+SPR 1999::Bayesian information criterion for longitudinal and clustered data+Jones, Richard H.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+NOV 10 2011::STUDY OF ALGORITHMS FOR COVARIANCE STRUCTURE-ANALYSIS WITH SPECIFIC COMPARISONS USING FACTOR-ANALYSIS+LEE, SY; JENNRICH, RI+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1979::no title+Little, R.

The phenomenon is due to the form of the functional dependence of the estimators on the parameter being held fixed and the way this affects the score function and/or the estimator of the asymptotic variance.

Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice: The First 60 Years and Beyond,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2012.695959,MAY 2012,36,2,"The Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice of the American Statistical Association (ASA) have evolved over a span of more than 60 years, going back to 1949. The Interim version of the Guidelines was published in 1980, the Trial version was published in 1983 and revised and formalized in 1989, the current version was approved by the Board of Directors and made available on the ASA's Web site in 1999, and ASA accreditation now requires statistical practitioners to agree to abide by them. The new century brings new ethical concerns for statisticians. As examples, bioethics is booming, climate science is newsworthy for both science and ethics, and issues of statistical integrity in research keeps the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Research Integrity very busy. In this century, we see a rapid increase in the ability to collect massive amounts of data, with complex structure and a sometimes sensitive nature. With these unparalleled opportunities for statisticians comes an increased need for clear guidelines on professional ethics. The evolution of the Guidelines therefore needs to continue. In this article, we examine the long history of the ASA Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice, and discuss potential areas for revision to meet the needs of our expanding profession.","ASA history,Code of conduct,Ethics,Statistical standards","AD HOC COMMITTEE,PROFESSIONAL ETHICS","Hurwitz, Shelley@Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Ctr Clin Invest, Boston, MA 02120 USA::Gardenier, John S.@Unknow","Hurwitz, Shelley@Harvard University::Gardenier, John S.@Unknow",not exist,"Interim Code of Conduct, American Statistical Association, General Guidelines,+no author+&lt;IT&gt;Amstat News&lt;/IT&gt;+1980::Interim Code of Conduct, American Statistical Association, General Guidelines.+no author+&lt;IT&gt;Amtstat News&lt;/IT&gt;+1981::Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice,+no author+&lt;IT&gt;The American Statistician&lt;/IT&gt;+1983::no title+no author+Reply, &lt;IT&gt;The American Statistician&lt;/IT&gt;+1983::Report of the Ad Hoc Committee on Statistical Standards+no author+&lt;IT&gt;The American Statistician&lt;/IT&gt;+1954::Report of the Ad Hoc Committee to Explore Opinion on Standard+no author+&lt;IT&gt;The American Statistician&lt;/IT&gt;+1956::Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice+[Anonymous].+&lt;IT&gt;Amstat News&lt;/IT&gt;+1998::ETHICAL GUIDELINES FOR STATISTICAL PRACTICE - REPORT OF THE AD HOC COMMITTEE ON PROFESSIONAL ETHICS - COMMENT+BARABBA, VP+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+1983::no title+Best, J.+Stat-spotting: a field guide to identifying dubious data+2008::ETHICAL GUIDELINES FOR STATISTICAL PRACTICE - REPORT OF THE AD HOC COMMITTEE ON PROFESSIONAL ETHICS - COMMENT+BOARDMAN, TJ+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+1983::ETHICAL GUIDELINES FOR STATISTICAL PRACTICE - REPORT OF THE AD HOC COMMITTEE ON PROFESSIONAL ETHICS - COMMENT+BROSS, IDJ+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+1983::AN EMPIRICAL-STUDY OF AN ESTIMATE OF SKEWNESS FOR THE PEARSON TYPE-III DISTRIBUTION+CAFFREY, J; PERRY, NC; TEICHROEW, D+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+1956::no title+no author+Ethical guidelines for statistical practice+1999::American Statistical Association Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice+no author+&lt;IT&gt;Amstat News&lt;/IT&gt;+1989::no title+COURT AT+AM STAT+1952::PRINCIPLES OF PROFESSIONAL STATISTICAL PRACTICE+DEMING, WE+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1965::CODE OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT - PERSONAL VIEW+DEMING, WE+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+1972::ETHICAL GUIDELINES FOR STATISTICAL PRACTICE - A HISTORICAL-PERSPECTIVE+ELLENBERG, JH+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+1983::ETHICAL GUIDELINES FOR STATISTICAL PRACTICE - REPORT OF THE AD HOC COMMITTEE ON PROFESSIONAL ETHICS - COMMENT+FREE, SM+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+1983::Recommendations for Describing Statistical Studies and Results in General Readership Science and Engineering Journals+Gardenier, J.

A Default Bayesian Hypothesis Test for ANOVA Designs,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2012.695956,MAY 2012,57,42,"This article presents a Bayesian hypothesis test for analysis of variance (ANOVA) designs. The test is an application of standard Bayesian methods for variable selection in regression models. We illustrate the effect of various g-priors on the ANOVA hypothesis test. The Bayesian test for ANOVA designs is useful for empirical researchers and for students; both groups will get a more acute appreciation of Bayesian inference when they can apply it to practical statistical problems such as ANOVA. We illustrate the use of the test with two examples, and we provide R code that makes the test easy to use.","Bayes factor,Model selection,Teaching Bayesian statistics","VARIABLE-SELECTION,LINDLEY PARADOX,P-VALUES,PRIORS,STATISTICS,REGRESSION,ASSOCIATION,CRITERION","Wetzels, Ruud@Univ Amsterdam, NL-1018 XA Amsterdam, Netherlands::Grasman, Raoul P.

On the Interrelation Between the Sample Mean and the Sample Variance,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2012.695960,MAY 2012,20,3,The linearity (or lack thereof) of association between sample mean and sample variance is explored in this note with the intent of providing new insights. Of particular interest is a well-known inequality involving the measures of skewness and kurtosis that is derived as a consequence of an identity involving the correlation between sample mean and sample variance. The nature of association between the two is explored further by means of the conditional expectation of the sample variance given the mean. We present several characterization results where the specific relationship of this conditional expectation and sample mean uniquely determines the parent population.

Community-Based Learning Versus Traditional Courses in Statistics: Who Takes Them and Why,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2012.701541,MAY 2012,13,1,"I compare students in two different data analysis courses: one course included a community-based learning (CBL) component and one did not. I find that students who chose to take the CBL course were more likely to have less mathematical and statistical background (as measured by the number of college-level mathematics and statistics courses and self-reporting), were more interested in community service, and wanted a statistics course that aligned closely with their career goals and aspirations. In comparison, students in the more traditional course had stronger mathematical and statistical skills, were more interested in a traditional course where they learned the methods from a variety of ""case-studies,"" and had less time for and interest in a community project. The results of the comparison suggest that there is a place for both CBL and traditional courses and that students tend to appropriately self-select into the course that meets their needs. CBL courses may also be a good place to draw in students who might otherwise not choose to take a data analysis course in college.","Service learning,Data analysis courses",,"Schofield, Lynne Steuerle@Swarthmore Coll, Dept Math & Stat, Swarthmore, PA 19081 USA","Schofield, Lynne Steuerle@Swarthmore College",not exist,"Community service statistics projects+Anderson, JE; Sungur, EA+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1999::no title+no author+Annual Membership Survey results: Executive summary+2010::The four-phase model of interest development+Hidi, S; Renninger, KA+EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGIST+SPR 2006::Learning Statistics at the Farmers Market?

Capabilities for handling single group, multiple group, nonnormal variables, and missing data are considered and the eight packages are Compared across a variety of criteria from documentation to parameter estimation. The main difference between the packages is the presence of a graphical interface for model specification and presentation of results. Each package differs in terms of strengths, areas of improvement, and unique features that may dictate the choice of selection. Some suggestions on areas of improvement for all software packages are made.

Exact Binomial Confidence Intervals for Randomized Response,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2012.663680,FEB 2012,21,2,"We consider the problem of finding an exact confidence interval for a proportion that is estimated using randomized response. For many randomized response schemes, this is equivalent to finding an exact confidence interval for a bounded binomial proportion. Such intervals can be obtained by truncating standard exact binomial confidence intervals, but the truncated intervals may be empty or misleadingly short. We address this problem by using exact confidence intervals obtained by inverting a likelihood ratio test that takes into account that the proportion is bounded. A simple adjustment is made to keep the intervals from being excessively conservative. An R function for computing the intervals is available as online supplementary material.","Binomial distribution,Bounded binomial proportion,Likelihood ratio,Simple random sampling","SENSITIVE QUESTIONS,PROPORTION,FRAMEWORK,ANSWER","Frey, Jesse@Villanova Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Villanova, PA 19085 USA::Perez, Andres@Temple Univ, Dept Stat, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA","Frey, Jesse@Villanova University::Perez, Andres@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Temple University",not exist,"Confidence curves and improved exact confidence intervals for discrete distributions+Blaker, H+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+DEC 2000::BINOMIAL CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS+BLYTH, CR; STILL, HA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1983::Confidence intervals for a binomial proportion and asymptotic expansions+Brown, LD; Cai, TT; DasGupta, A+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 2002::Interval estimation for a binomial proportion - Comment - Rejoinder+Brown, LD; Cai, TT; DasGupta, A; et al.+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 2001::HOW TO GET ANSWER WITHOUT BEING SURE YOU HAVE ASKED QUESTION+CAMPBELL, C; JOINER, BL+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+1973::REFINING BINOMIAL CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS+CASELLA, G+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+JUN 1986::no title+Chaudhuri, A.+Randomized response and indirect questioning techniques in surveys+2011::The use of confidence or fiducial limits illustrated in the case of the binomial.+Clopper, CJ; Pearson, ES+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1934::APPLICATION OF RANDOMIZED RESPONSE TECHNIQUE IN OBTAINING QUANTITATIVE DATA+GREENBERG, BG; KUEBLER, RR; ABERNATHY, JR; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1971::UNRELATED QUESTION RANDOMIZED RESPONSE MODEL - THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK+GREENBERG, BG; ABULELA, ALA; SIMMONS, WR; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1969::ASKING SENSITIVE QUESTIONS INDIRECTLY+KUK, AYC+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1990::Setting confidence intervals for bounded parameters+Mandelkern, M+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 2002::AN IMPROVED RANDOMIZED-RESPONSE STRATEGY+MANGAT, NS+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1994::A unified framework for analysis and comparison of randomized response surveys of binary characteristics+Nayak, Tapan K.; Adeshiyan, Samson A.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+AUG 1 2009::A standardization of randomized response strategies+Quatember, Andreas+SURVEY METHODOLOGY+DEC 2009::Sample Surveys With Sensitive Questions: A Nonrandomized Response Approach+Tan, Ming T.; Tian, Guo-Liang; Tang, Man-Lai+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+FEB 2009::no title+TOTIC E+ANN STAT+no time::Randomized response, statistical disclosure control and misclassification: a review+van den Hout, A; van der Heijden, PGM+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+AUG 2002::The monotone boundary property and the full coverage property of confidence intervals for a binomial proportion+Wang, Hsiuying+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+FEB 2010::Exact confidence coefficients of confidence intervals for a binomial proportion+Wang, Hsiuying+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 2007::RANDOMIZED-RESPONSE - A SURVEY TECHNIQUE FOR ELIMINATING EVASIVE ANSWER BIAS+WARNER, SL+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1965"
Treatment Heterogeneity and Individual Qualitative Interaction,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2012.671724,FEB 2012,39,10,"Plausibility of high variability in treatment effects across individuals has been recognized as an important consideration in clinical studies. Surprisingly, little attention has been given to evaluating this variability in design of clinical trials or analyses of resulting data. High variation in a treatment's efficacy or safety across individuals (referred to herein as treatment heterogeneity) may have important consequences because the optimal treatment choice for an individual may be different from that suggested by a study of average effects. We call this an individual qualitative interaction (IQI), borrowing terminology from earlier work-referring to a qualitative interaction (QI) being present when the optimal treatment varies across ""groups"" of individuals. At least three techniques have been proposed to investigate treatment heterogeneity: techniques to detect a QI, use of measures such as the density overlap of two outcome variables under different treatments, and use of cross-over designs to observe ""individual effects."" We elucidate underlying connections among them, their limitations, and some assumptions that may be required. We do so under a potential outcomes framework that can add insights to results from usual data analyses and to study design features that improve the capability to more directly assess treatment heterogeneity.","Causation,Cross-over interaction,Individual effects,Potential outcomes,Probability of similar response,Subject-treatment interaction","BY-FORMULATION INTERACTION,CLINICAL-TRIALS,PATIENT SUBSETS,BIAS,BIOEQUIVALENCE,STATISTICS,INFERENCE,MEDICINE,OVERLAP","Poulson, Robert S.@Edwards AFB, Stat Methods Grp, Edwards AFB, CA 93524 USA::Gadbury, Gary L.@Kansas State Univ, Dept Stat, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA::Allison, David B.@Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Biostat, Sect Stat Genet, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA","Poulson, Robert S.@United States Air Force@United States Department of Defense::Gadbury, Gary L.@Kansas State University::Allison, David B.@University of Alabama Birmingham@University of Alabama System","Allison, David@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3566-9399","A 2-PERIOD DESIGN WITH T2 EXPERIMENTAL UNITS+BALAAM, LN+BIOMETRICS+1968::CROSSOVER EXPERIMENT FOR CLINICAL-TRIALS+BROWN, BW+BIOMETRICS+1980::SELECTING OPTIMAL TREATMENT IN CLINICAL-TRIALS USING COVARIATE INFORMATION+BYAR, DP; CORLE, DK+JOURNAL OF CHRONIC DISEASES+1977::no title+Darwin, C.+The Origin of Species+1871::Subject-by-formulation interaction in determinations of individual bioequivalence: Bias and prevalence+Endrenyi, L; Tothfalusi, L+PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH+FEB 1999::Partial identification of the distribution of treatment effects and its confidence sets (with Sang Soo Park)+Fan, Y.; Park, S.+Nonparametric Econometric Methods+2009::SHARP BOUNDS ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF TREATMENT EFFECTS AND THEIR STATISTICAL INFERENCE+Fan, Yanqin; Park, Sang Soo+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+JUN 2010::Evaluating subject-treatment interaction when comparing two treatments.+Gadbury, G L; Iyer, H K; Allison, D B+Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics+2001-Nov::Randomization inference and bias of standard errors+Gadbury, GL+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+NOV 2001::Unit-treatment interaction and its practical consequences+Gadbury, GL; Iyer, HK+BIOMETRICS+SEP 2000::Subject-treatment interaction+Gadbury, GL.+Encyclopedia of Biophar-maceutical Statistics+2010::TESTING FOR QUALITATIVE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN TREATMENT EFFECTS AND PATIENT SUBSETS+GAIL, M; SIMON, R+BIOMETRICS+1985::STATISTICAL MEASURES OF EARNINGS DIFFERENTIALS+GASTWIRTH, JL+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+1975::Subject-by-formulation interaction in bioequivalence: Conceptual and statistical issues+Hauck, WW; Hyslop, T; Chen, ML; et al.+PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH+APR 2000::STATISTICS AND CAUSAL INFERENCE+HOLLAND, PW+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1986::No evidence for a major role of polymorphisms during bupropion treatment+Hu, Jianfang; Redden, David T.; Berrettini, Wade H.; et al.+OBESITY+NOV 2006::THE OVERLAPPING COEFFICIENT AS A MEASURE OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN PROBABILITY-DISTRIBUTIONS AND POINT ESTIMATION OF THE OVERLAP OF 2 NORMAL DENSITIES+INMAN, HF; BRADLEY, EL+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1989::Investigation of responders and non-responders to long-term donepezil treatment+Inoue, Jun; Hoshino, Ryoichi; Nojima, Hidenori; et al.+PSYCHOGERIATRICS+JUN 2010::Detecting qualitative interactions in clinical trials: An extension of range test+Li, Jianjun; Chan, Ivan S.

Estimating the Correlation in Bivariate Normal Data With Known Variances and Small Sample Sizes,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2012.676329,FEB 2012,28,8,"We consider the problem of estimating the correlation in bivariate normal data when the means and variances are assumed known, with emphasis on the small sample case. We consider eight different estimators, several of them considered here for the first time in the literature. In a simulation study, we found that Bayesian estimators using the uniform and arc-sine priors outperformed several empirical and exact or approximate maximum likelihood estimators in small samples. The arc-sine prior did better for large values of the correlation. For testing whether the correlation is zero, we found that Bayesian hypothesis tests outperformed significance tests based on the empirical and exact or approximate maximum likelihood estimators considered in small samples, but that all tests performed similarly for sample size 50. These results lead us to suggest using the posterior mean with the arc-sine prior to estimate the correlation in small samples when the variances are assumed known.","Arc-sine prior,Bayes factor,Bayesian test,Jeffreys prior,Maximum likelihood estimator,Uniform prior","CORRELATION-COEFFICIENT,MODELS,MATRICES","Fosdick, Bailey K.@Univ Washington, Dept Stat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA::Raftery, Adrian E.@Univ Washington, Dept Stat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Fosdick, Bailey K.@University of Washington@University of Washington Seattle::Raftery, Adrian E.@University of Washington@University of Washington Seattle","Fosdick, Bailey@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3736-2219","Probabilistic Projections of the Total Fertility Rate for All Countries+Alkema, Leontine; Raftery, Adrian E.; Gerland, Patrick; et al.+DEMOGRAPHY+AUG 2011::Modeling covariance matrices in terms of standard deviations and correlations, with application to shrinkage+Barnard, J; McCulloch, R; Meng, XL+STATISTICA SINICA+OCT 2000::Objective priors for the bivariate normal model+Berger, James O.; Sun, Dongchu+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2008::THE NATURE OF THE DATA, OR HOW TO CHOOSE A CORRELATION-COEFFICIENT+CARROLL, JB+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1961::Analysis of multivariate probit models+Chib, S; Greenberg, E+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1998::THE PERFORMANCE OF SOME CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS FOR A GENERAL BIVARIATE DISTRIBUTION+FARLIE, DJG+BIOMETRIKA+1960::SAMPLE CORRELATION-COEFFICIENT IN TRUNCATED BIVARIATE NORMAL POPULATION+GAJJAR, AV; SUBRAHMANIAM, K+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS PART B-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+1978::BAYESIAN-ESTIMATION IN MULTIVARIATE-ANALYSIS+GEISSER, S+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1965::POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTIONS OFR MULTIVARIATE NORMAL PARAMETERS+GEISSER, S; CORNFIELD, J+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1963::Bayesian and likelihood-based inference for the bivariate normal correlation coefficient+Ghosh, M.; Mukherjee, B.; Santra, U.; et al.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+JUN 2010::Some tests of significance, treated by the theory of probability+Jeffreys, H+PROCEEDINGS OF THE CAMBRIDGE PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY+1935::no title+Jeffreys, H.+Theory of probability+1961::BAYES FACTORS+KASS, RE; RAFTERY, AE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1995::no title+Kendall, S.

Such models usually have several variance components, including one for errors and at least one for random effects. Likelihood and Bayesian inference depend on the likelihood function of those variances. But in the absence of constraints or further specifications that are not inherent to ICARs, the likelihood function is arbitrary and thus so are some inferences. We suggest several ways to add constraints or further specifications, but any choice is merely a convention.","Conditional autoregression,Improper distributions,Intrinsic random fields,Markov random fields","SPATIAL MODELS,SYSTEMS","Lavine, Michael L.@Univ Massachusetts, Dept Math & Stat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA::Hodges, James S.@Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Biostat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Lavine, Michael L.@University of Massachusetts System@University of Massachusetts Amherst::Hodges, James S.@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities",not exist,"no title+Banerjee, S; Gelfand, AE; Carlin, BP.+Hierarchical modeling and analysis for spatial data+2003::BAYESIAN IMAGE-RESTORATION, WITH 2 APPLICATIONS IN SPATIAL STATISTICS+BESAG, J; YORK, J; MOLLIE, A+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+MAR 1991::On conditional and intrinsic autoregressions+Besag, J; Kooperberg, C+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1995::SPATIAL INTERACTION AND STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS OF LATTICE SYSTEMS+BESAG, J+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1974::BAYESIAN COMPUTATION AND STOCHASTIC-SYSTEMS+BESAG, J; GREEN, P; HIGDON, D; et al.+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+FEB 1995::STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS OF NON-LATTICE DATA+BESAG, J+STATISTICIAN+1975::Conditioning as disintegration+Chang, JT; Pollard, D+STATISTICA NEERLANDICA+NOV 1997::Bayesian Methods for Mapping Disease Risk+Clayton, D.

Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces for Penalized Regression: A Tutorial,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2012.678196,FEB 2012,31,6,"Penalized regression procedures have become very popular ways to estimate complicated functions. The smoothing spline, for example, is the solution of a minimization problem in a functional space. If such a minimization problem is posed on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), the solution is guaranteed to exist, is unique, and has a very simple form. There are excellent books and articles about RKHS and their applications in statistics; however, this existing literature is very dense. This article provides a friendly reference for a reader approaching this subject for the first time. It begins with a simple problem, a system of linear equations, and then gives an intuitive motivation for reproducing kernels. Armed with the intuition gained from our first examples, we take the reader from vector spaces to Banach spaces and to RKHS. Finally, we present some statistical estimation problems that can be solved using the mathematical machinery discussed. After reading this tutorial, the reader will be ready to study more advanced texts and articles about the subject, such as those by Wahba or Gu. Online supplements are available for this article.","Projection principle,Regularization,Representation Theorem,Ridge Regression,Smoothing Splines","GENERALIZED CROSS-VALIDATION,SELECTION,LASSO","Nosedal-Sanchez, Alvaro@Indiana Univ Penn, Dept Math, Indiana, PA 15705 USA::Storlie, Curtis B.@Los Alamos Natl Lab, Stat Sci Grp, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA::Lee, Thomas C.

Measurement Error and the Hot Hand,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2012.676467,FEB 2012,17,7,This article shows that the first autocorrelation of basketball shot results is a highly biased and inconsistent estimator of the first autocorrelation of the ex ante probabilities with which the shots are made. Shot result autocorrelation is close to zero even when shot probability autocorrelation is close to one. The bias is caused by what is equivalent to a severe measurement error problem.

P-Value Precision and Reproducibility,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tas.2011.10129,NOV 2011,27,34,"P-values are useful statistical measures of evidence against a null hypothesis. In contrast to other statistical estimates, however, their sample-to-sample variability is usually not considered or estimated, and therefore not fully appreciated. Via a systematic study of log-scale p-value standard errors, bootstrap prediction bounds, and reproducibility probabilities for future replicate p-values, we show that p-values exhibit surprisingly large variability in typical data situations. In addition to providing context to discussions about the failure of statistical results to replicate, our findings shed light on the relative value of exact p-values vis-a-vis approximate p-values, and indicate that the use of *, **, and *** to denote levels 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001 of statistical significance in subject-matter journals is about the right level of precision for reporting p-values when judged by widely accepted rules for rounding statistical estimates.","Log p-value,Measure of evidence,Prediction interval,Reproducibility probability","BOOTSTRAP PREDICTION INTERVALS,SIGNIFICANCE LEVEL,RANDOM-VARIABLES,PROBABILITY","Boos, Dennis D.@N Carolina State Univ, Dept Stat, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA::Stefanski, Leonard A.@N Carolina State Univ, Dept Stat, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Boos, Dennis D.@North Carolina State University@University of North Carolina::Stefanski, Leonard A.@North Carolina State University@University of North Carolina",not exist,"STOCHASTIC COMPARISON OF TESTS+BAHADUR, RR+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1960::Minimum Distance Estimators for Location and Goodness-of-Fit+Boos, D.

Empirical Performance of Cross-Validation With Oracle Methods in a Genomics Context,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tas.2011.11052,NOV 2011,9,12,"When employing model selection methods with oracle properties such as the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCA.D) and the Adaptive Lasso, it is typical to estimate the smoothing parameter by m-fold cross-validation, for example, m = 10. In problems where the true regression function is sparse and the signals large, such cross-validation typically works well. However, in regression modeling of genomic studies involving Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP), the true regression functions, while thought to be sparse, do not have large signals. We demonstrate empirically that in such problems, the number of selected variables using SCAD and the Adaptive Lasso, with 10-fold cross-validation, is a random variable that has considerable and surprising variation. Similar remarks apply to non-oracle methods such as the Lasso. Our study strongly questions the suitability of performing only a single run of m-fold crossvalidation with any oracle method, and not just the SCAD and Adaptive Lasso.","Adaptive Lasso,Lasso,Model selection,Oracle estimation","NONCONCAVE PENALIZED LIKELIHOOD,SELECTION,LASSO","Martinez, Josue G.@Texas A&M Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Sch Rural Publ Hlth, College Stn, TX 77843 USA::Carroll, Raymond J.@Texas A&M Univ, Dept Stat, College Stn, TX 77843 USA::Mueller, Samuel@Univ Sydney, Sch Math & Stat, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia::Sampson, Joshua N.@NCI, Div Canc Epidemiol & Genet, Rockville, MD 20852 USA::Chatterjee, Nilanjan@NCI, Div Canc Epidemiol & Genet, Rockville, MD 20852 USA","Martinez, Josue G.@Texas A&M University System@Texas A&M Health Science Center::Carroll, Raymond J.@Texas A&M University System@Texas A&M University College Station::Mueller, Samuel@University of Sydney::Sampson, Joshua N.@National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA@NIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)::Chatterjee, Nilanjan@National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA@NIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)","Mueller, Samuel@D-4850-2009@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3087-8127","Variable selection via nonconcave penalized likelihood and its oracle properties+Fan, JQ; Li, RZ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2001::Frequentist model average estimators+Hjort, NL; Claeskens, G+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2003::DASSO: connections between the Dantzig selector and lasso+James, Gareth M.; Radchenko, Peter; Lv, Jinchi+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2009::Model selection and inference: Facts and fiction+Leeb, H; Potscher, BM+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+FEB 2005::no title+POTSCHER BK+J MULTIVARIATE ANAL+2007::Regression shrinkage and selection via the Lasso+Tibshirani, R+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1996::Tuning parameter selectors for the smoothly clipped absolute deviation method+Wang, Hansheng; Li, Runze; Tsai, Chih-Ling+BIOMETRIKA+AUG 2007::One-step sparse estimates in nonconcave penalized likelihood models+Zou, Hui; Li, Runze+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+AUG 2008::The adaptive lasso and its oracle properties+Zou, Hui+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2006"
Matching for Several Sparse Nominal Variables in a Case-Control Study of Readmission Following Surgery,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tas.2011.11072,NOV 2011,31,10,"Matching for several nominal covariates with many levels has usually been thought to be difficult because these covariates combine to form an enormous number of interaction categories with few if any people in most such categories. Moreover, because nominal variables are not ordered, there is often no notion of a ""close substitute"" when an exact match is unavailable. In a case-control study of the risk factors for readmission within 30 days of surgery in the Medicare population, we wished to match for 47 hospitals, 15 surgical procedures grouped or nested within 5 procedure groups, two genders, or 47 x 15 x 2 = 1410 categories. In addition, we wished to match as closely as possible for the continuous variable age (65-80 years). There were 1380 readmitted patients or cases. A fractional factorial experiment may balance main effects and low-order interactions without achieving balance for high-order interactions. In an analogous fashion, we balance certain main effects and low-order interactions among the covariates; moreover, we use as many exactly matched pairs as possible. This is done by creating a match that is exact for several variables, with a close match for age, and both a ""near-exact match"" and a ""finely balanced match"" for another nominal variable, in this case a 47 x 5 = 235 category variable representing the interaction of the 47 hospitals and the five surgical procedure groups. The method is easily implemented in R.","Assignment algorithm,Caliper match,Finely balanced match,Near-exact match","REGRESSION ADJUSTMENT,PROPENSITY SCORE,BIAS REDUCTION","Zubzarreta, Jose R.@Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Dept Stat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA::Reinke, Caroline E.@Univ Penn, Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA::Kelz, Rachel R.@Univ Penn, Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA::Silber, Jeffrey H.@Univ Penn, Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA::Rosenbaum, Paul R.@Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Dept Stat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Zubzarreta, Jose R.@University of Pennsylvania::Reinke, Caroline E.@University of Pennsylvania::Kelz, Rachel R.@University of Pennsylvania::Silber, Jeffrey H.@University of Pennsylvania::Rosenbaum, Paul R.@University of Pennsylvania","Rosenbaum, Paul@H-8687-2012","no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical Data Analysis+2002::Software for optimal matching in observational studies+Bergstralh, EJ; Kosanke, JL; Jacobsen, SJ+EPIDEMIOLOGY+MAY 1996::A NEW ALGORITHM FOR THE ASSIGNMENT PROBLEM+BERTSEKAS, DP+MATHEMATICAL PROGRAMMING+1981::no title+Cleveland, W.

Do the Chi-Square Test and Fisher's Exact Test Agree in Determining Extreme for 2 x 2 Tables?,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tas.2011.10115,NOV 2011,15,7,"There are two common methods for statistical inference on 2 x 2 contingency tables. One is the widely taught Pearson chi-square test, which uses the well-known chi(2) statistic. The chi-square test is appropriate for large sample inference, and it is equivalent to the Z-test that uses the difference between the two sample proportions for the 2 x 2 case. Another method is Fisher's exact test, which evaluates the likelihood of each table with the same marginal totals. This article mathematically justifies that these two methods for determining extreme do not completely agree with each other. Our analysis obtains one-sided and two-sided conditions under which a disagreement in determining extreme between the two tests could occur. We also address the question whether or not their discrepancy in determining extreme would make them draw different conclusions when testing homogeneity or independence. Our examination of the two tests casts light on which test should be trusted when the two tests draw different conclusions.","Contingency table,Pearson's chi-square test","2X2 CONTINGENCY-TABLES,INDEPENDENT BINOMIAL PROPORTIONS,CONTINUITY CORRECTION,UNCONDITIONAL TESTS","Chen, Yung-Pin@Lewis & Clark Coll, Dept Math Sci, Portland, OR 97219 USA","Chen, Yung-Pin@Unknow",not exist,"no title+AGOSTINO RB+AM STAT+1988::A survey of exact inference for Contingency Tables+Agresti, A.+Statistical Science+1992::The Wilcoxon, Spearman, Fisher, chi(2)-, Student and Pearson tests and 2x2 tables+Andres, AM; Tejedor, IH; Mato, AS+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES D-THE STATISTICIAN+1995::IN DISPRAISE OF EXACT TEST - DO MARGINAL TOTALS OF 2X2 TABLE CONTAIN RELEVANT INFORMATION RESPECTING TABLE PROPORTIONS+BERKSON, J+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+1978::SOME REASONS FOR NOT USING YATES CONTINUITY CORRECTION ON 2X2 CONTINGENCY-TABLES+CONOVER, WJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1974::EXACT TESTS FOR 2X2 CONTINGENCY-TABLES+DAVIS, LJ+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1986::CONTINUITY CORRECTION IN CHI-2-TEST FOR 2BY2 TABLES+GRIZZLE, JE+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+1967::A COMPARISON OF SOME CONDITIONAL AND UNCONDITIONAL EXACT TESTS FOR 2X2 CONTINGENCY-TABLES+HABER, M+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+1987::Which exact test is more powerful in testing the Hardy-Weinberg law?+Kang, Seung-Ho+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+2008::PRACTICAL TESTS OF 2BY2 CONTINGENCY-TABLES+LIDDELL, D+STATISTICIAN+1976::Improved p-Value Tests for Comparing Two Independent Binomial Proportions+Lin, Che-Yang; Yang, Ming-Chung+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+2009::TESTING THE EQUALITY OF 2 INDEPENDENT BINOMIAL PROPORTIONS+LITTLE, RJA+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+NOV 1989::Conditional and unconditional tests of association in 2 x 2 tables+Macdonald, RR+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+NOV 1998::EXACT POWER OF CONDITIONAL AND UNCONDITIONAL TESTS - GOING BEYOND THE 2X2 CONTINGENCY TABLE+MEHTA, CR; HILTON, JF+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1993::Eleven ways to look at the chi-squared coefficient for contingency tables+Mirkin, B+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 2001"

An Account of Early Statistical Inference in Arab Cryptology,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tas.2011.10191,NOV 2011,12,1,"Recently discovered manuscripts reveal an early use of statistical inference in Arab cryptology in the eighth through twelfth centuries A.D. The manuscripts report that al-Kindi (801-873) used relative frequency analysis some 1100 years ago to decode messages, some 800 years before the correspondence between Pascal and Fermat. Among his many accomplishments, al-Kindi is the author of the oldest known book on cryptology. This article describes an early use of statistical methods for the cryptanalysis of encrypted messages.","al-Kindi,Cryptogram,Relative frequency analysis",,"Broemeling, Lyle D.@Broemeling & Associates Inc, Medical Lake, WA 99022 USA","Broemeling, Lyle D.@Unknow",not exist,"Origins of cryptology: the Arab contributions+Al-Kadi, I.

"A Polyplot for Visualizing Location, Spread, Skewness, and Kurtosis",AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tas.2011.11012,NOV 2011,10,0,"A plot that includes multiple location and spread statistics can provide useful information about the shape of a distribution, not only with respect to location and variability but also with respect to skewness and kurtosis. We propose a plot containing the interquartile range, mean absolute deviation, standard deviation, and range of a dataset. The comparison of the spread statistics gives information about kurtosis and the comparison of the location statistics gives information about skewness. After the distribution has been divided into two parts by the median, the interquartile range can be thought of as the distance between the medians in each half of the distribution. We explain how the mean absolute deviation with respect to the median can similarly be visualized as half the distance between the means in each half of the distribution. An R function to produce the polyplot is available as an online supplement.","Boxplot,Distribution shape,Mean absolute deviation,Median",,"Seier, Edith@E Tennessee State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Johnson City, TN 37614 USA::Bonett, Douglas G.@Iowa State Univ, Dept Stat & Psychol, Ames, IA 50011 USA","Seier, Edith@East Tennessee State University::Bonett, Douglas G.@Iowa State University",not exist,"DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS FOR NONPARAMETRIC MODELS .1.

Statistical Accuracy of Spreadsheet Software,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tas.2011.09076,NOV 2011,26,10,"As the use of spreadsheet packages for statistical analysis increases, so does the need for assessing the reliability of these packages. This study compares the accuracy of six spreadsheet packages: Excel, Google Does, Gnumeric, Numbers, OpenOffice Calc, and Quattro Pro. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) compiled sets of data specifically to test for computational accuracy. Certified statistically accurate computations for standard statistical procedures accompany these datasets. This study analyzes the accuracy of summary statistics such as the mean, standard deviation, and autocorrelation as well as the F statistics for a one-way ANOVA, and the coefficients and R(2) statistics in regression analysis using the Statistical Reference Datasets (StRD) provided by NIST. Wilkinson's Tests are also examined to document a package's ability to perform rounding, univariate statistics, scatterplots, and regression/correlation with particularly challenging data. The final analysis reports the accuracy of probability and percentile computations involving statistical distributions. The results suggest that Gnumeric is the most reliable both in performing statistical analysis and for calculations involving statistical distributions. Google Does spreadsheet, while convenient, has deficiencies and should not be used for scientific statistical analysis.

An Overview of Current Software Procedures for Fitting Linear Mixed Models,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tas.2011.11077,NOV 2011,43,20,"At present, there are many software procedures available that enable statisticians to fit linear mixed models (LMMs) to continuous dependent variables in clustered or longitudinal datasets. LMMs are flexible tools for analyzing relationships among variables in these types of datasets, in that a variety of covariance structures can be used depending on the subject matter under study. The explicit random effects in LMMs allow analysts to make inferences about the variability between clusters or subjects in larger hypothetical populations, and examine cluster- or subject-level variables that explain portions of this variability. These models can also be used to analyze longitudinal or clustered datasets with data that are missing at random (MAR), and can accommodate time-varying covariates in longitudinal datasets. Although the software procedures currently available have many features in common, more specific analytic aspects of fitting LMMs (e.g., crossed random effects, appropriate hypothesis testing for variance components, diagnostics, incorporating sampling weights) may only be available in selected software procedures. With this article, we aim to perform a comprehensive and up-to-date comparison of the current capabilities of software procedures for fitting LMMs, and provide statisticians with a guide for selecting a software procedure appropriate for their analytic goals.","Covariance structures,Longitudinal data analysis,Models for clustered data,Statistical software","LIKELIHOOD,TESTS","West, Brady T.@Univ Michigan, Survey Methodol Program, Survey Res Ctr, Inst Social Res, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA::Galecki, Andrzej T.@Univ Michigan, Ctr Stat Consultat & Res, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA@Univ Michigan, Inst Gerontol, Sch Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA@Univ Michigan, Dept Biostat, Sch Publ Hlth, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","West, Brady T.@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan::Galecki, Andrzej T.@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan",not exist,"Multilevel Modeling of Complex Survey Data+Asparouhov, T.; Muthen, B.+P JOINT STAT M SEATT+2006::lme4: Linear mixed-effects models using S4 classes+Bates, D.; Maechler, M.; Bolker, B.

Statistical Sleuthing by Leveraging Human Nature: A Study of Olympic Figure Skating,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2011.10165,AUG 2011,14,4,"Analysis of figure skating scoring is notoriously difficult under the new Code Of Points (CoP) scoring system, created following the judging scandal of the 2002 Olympic Winter Games. The CoP involves the selection of a random subpanel of judges; scores from other judges are reported but not used. An attempt to repeat the methods of previous studies establishing the presence of nationalistic bias in CoP scoring failed to recreate the competition scores from the raw scoring sheets. This raised the concern that different subpanels of judges were being selected for each skater (breaking ISU rules). However, it is also possible that the ISU was attempting to further reduce transparency in the system by permuting, separately for each skater, the order of the presentation of scores from the judging panel. Intuition suggests that it is impossible to tell the difference between accidental randomization and intentional permutation of the judges' scores. Although the recent changes do successfully prevent the study of nationalistic bias, this article provides strong evidence against the hypothesis that a separate random subpanel is chosen for each competitor. It addresses the problem by applying Gleser's extension of the Kolmogorov Smirnov goodness-of-fit test.

Using Randomized Confidence Limits to Balance Risk: An Application to Medicare Investigations,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2011.10197,AUG 2011,13,2,"Consider a population of N payments by Medicare to a health care provider, each payment for $4000. Suppose that an unknown number M of the payments are not justified and the other N M payments are justified. A random sample of n payments is chosen and audited to determine if money should be recouped from the provider for the unjustified payments. Medicare guidelines state that in most situations the recoupment figure be determined by the lower end of a one-sided 90% confidence interval estimate of M based on a finding of X sample payments not to be justified. An exact lower estimate L = L(X) with the property P(M) (L <= M)>= 0.90 for all M = 0, 1, ... , N - 1 is an integral component of the minimum sum method that has been used in setting recoupment figures in Medicare audits (Edwards et al. 2003).

In this article, we show the simple construction of a randomized lower estimate L R that improves upon L in the sense that L(R) >= L with probability 1 with P*(M) (L(R) <= M) = 0.90 for all M = 0, 1, ... , N - 1. In addition, we report on coverage probability and expectation from a Monte Carlo study that compares L(R) to lower estimates that are based on normal approximation.

Whereas randomized confidence intervals for the parameter pi of the Binomial distribution are well-studied and discussed in the literature, this seems not to be the case with the estimation of the parameter M of the Hypergeometric distribution.","Binomial,Hypergeometric,Medicare overpayment recovery,Minimum sum method,Randomized confidence intervals","BINOMIAL PROPORTION,INTERVAL ESTIMATION","Gilliland, Dennis@Michigan State Univ, Dept Stat & Probabil, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA::Edwards, Don@Univ S Carolina, Dept Stat, Columbia, SC 29208 USA","Gilliland, Dennis@Michigan State University::Edwards, Don@University of South Carolina Columbia@University of South Carolina@University of South Carolina System",not exist,"Approximate is better than ""exact"" for interval estimation of binomial proportions+Agresti, A; Coull, BA+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1998::Comment: Randomized confidence intervals and the mid-P approach+Agresti, A; Gottard, A+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+NOV 2005::Confidence intervals for a binomial proportion and asymptotic expansions+Brown, LD; Cai, TT; DasGupta, A+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 2002::no title+BROWN LD+STAT SCI+2005::Interval estimation for a binomial proportion - Comment - Rejoinder+Brown, LD; Cai, TT; DasGupta, A; et al.+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 2001::no title+*CTR MED MED SERV+CMS MAN SYST+2005::no title+EDWARDS D+232 U S CAR DEP STAT+2010::The minimum sum method: a distribution-free sampling procedure for medicare fraud investigations+Edwards, D.; Ward-Besser, G.; Lasecki, J.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Parker, B.; Wieduwilt, K.; Wu, F.; Moorhead, P</span>.+Health Serv.

"The Identification of ""Unusual"" Health-Care Providers From a Hierarchical Model",AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2011.10190,AUG 2011,39,31,"It has become common to adopt a hierarchical model structure when comparing the performance of multiple health-care providers. This structure allows some variation in such measures, beyond that explained by sampling variation, to be ""normal,"" in recognition of the fact that risk-adjustment is never perfect. The shrinkage estimates arising from such a model structure also have appealing properties.

It is not immediately clear, however, how ""unusual"" providers, that is, any with particularly high or low rates, can be identified based on such a model. Given that some variation in underlying rates is assumed to be the norm, we argue that it is not generally appropriate to identify a provider as interesting based only on evidence of it lying above or below the population mean. We note with concern, however, that this practice is not uncommon.

We examine in detail three possible strategies for identifying unusual Providers, carefully distinguishing between statistical ""outliers"" and ""extremes.""

A Note on Comparing the Power of Test Statistics at Low Significance Levels,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2011.10117,AUG 2011,7,6,"It is an obvious fact that the power of a test statistic is dependent upon the significance (alpha) level at which the test is performed. It is perhaps a less obvious fact that the relative performance of two statistics in terms of power is also a function of the alpha level. Through numerous personal discussions, we have noted that even some competent statisticians have the mistaken intuition that relative power comparisons at traditional levels such as alpha = 0.05 will be roughly similar to relative power comparisons at very low levels, such as the level alpha = 5 x 10(-8), which is commonly used in genome-wide association studies. In this brief note, we demonstrate that this notion is in fact quite wrong, especially with respect to comparing tests with differing degrees of freedom. In fact, at very low alpha levels the cost of additional degrees of freedom is often comparatively low. Thus we recommend that statisticians exercise caution when interpreting the results of power comparison studies which use alpha levels that will not be used in practice.","Degrees of freedom,Genome wide association,Multiple testing",ASSOCIATION,"Morris, Nathan@Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA::Elston, Robert@Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA","Morris, Nathan@Case Western Reserve University::Elston, Robert@Case Western Reserve University","Morris, Nathan@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7989-5764","How accurate are the extremely small P-values used in genomic research: An evaluation of numerical libraries+Bangalore, Sai Santosh; Wang, Jelai; Allison, David B.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+MAY 15 2009::ROBUSTNESS+BRADLEY, JV+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1978::no title+Hogg, R.

Swivelling Probabilities-The Winning Hand at Poker,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2011.09175,AUG 2011,10,0,"Poker has become a very popular card game both privately, in casinos, and on the Internet. A variant of the game known as Texas Hold'em (THm) which uses common or ""community"" cards is now televised widely with prize-winning tournaments and has a large following. This article examines the odds of poker hands up to the 8-card variant and considers the effect on these odds of systematically increasing the number of players at the table. It further considers the probability distribution of the ""winning hand"" in poker across different variants of poker, for a varying number of participants, to show that particularly for the 7-card variants with more than five players, the probability of a straight, or higher hand, winning becomes comparatively large. It concludes that as the number of players increases, the probabilities of the winning hand ""swivels"" around some particular hand, in that the probabilities of hands winning which are ranked below this swivel point hand decrease monotonically, whereas the probabilities of hands winning which are ranked above this swivel point increase monotonically. This increase and decrease effect on the probability of winning is muted by the introduction of a poker system, such as THm, which uses community cards.","Card game,Community cards,Number of players,Texas Hold'em","STATISTICS,STRATEGIES,HISTORY","Barr, G.

Are Biostatistics Students Prepared to Succeed in the Era of Interdisciplinary Science? (And How Will We Know?),AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2011.10222,MAY 2011,32,11,"Recent years have seen an increasing emphasis on interdisciplinary approaches to solving problems in biomedical and public health research. While the concept is not new, interest in interdisciplinarity is expanding, as reflected by the growing body of literature on interdisciplinarity, the increasing prominence of teams of researchers working collaboratively, and the intense interest on the part of public and private granting agencies to fund interdisciplinary research proposals. The reason most often cited for the mounting interest in interdisciplinarity is that we are addressing health problems that are highly complex; and complex problems require complex approaches to achieve solutions. To produce investigators who can succeed in interdisciplinary environments, training programs must impart an understanding of the rationale behind these approaches, how they are distinct from more traditional approaches, and the skills to be successful members and leaders of interdisciplinary teams across a wide range of health research initiatives.

Skewness-Invariant Measures of Kurtosis,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2011.10194,MAY 2011,26,16,"Measures of kurtosis, when applied to asymmetric distributions, are typically much affected by the asymmetry which muddies their already murky interpretation yet further. Certain kurtosis measures, however, when applied to certain wide families of skew-symmetric distributions display the attractive property of skewness-invariance. In this article, we concentrate mainly on quantile-based measures of kurtosis and their interaction with skewness-inducing transformations, identifying classes of transformations that leave kurtosis measures invariant. Further miscellaneous aspects of skewness-invariant kurtosis measures are briefly considered, these not being quantile-based and/or not involving transformations. While our treatment is as unified as we are able to make it, we do not claim anything like a complete characterization of skewness-invariant kurtosis measures but hope that our results will stimulate further research into the issue.","Asymmetry,Johnson distributions,Quantile measures,Sinh function,Sinh-arcsinh transformation","DISTRIBUTIONS,ASYMMETRY","Jones, M.

Distributional Characteristics: Just a Few More Moments,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2011.10022,MAY 2011,21,3,"The ability of statistical models to accurately characterize distributional characteristics such as skewness and kurtosis can impact the results of statistical analysis. This article compares the feasible skewness kurtosis spaces for two generalizations of the lognormal, the inverse hyperbolic sine (IHS) and g-and-h probability density functions (pdf's), each of which can accommodate a wide variety of distributional characteristics. For Is >= 0, the boundary of the skewness kurtosis spaces for g-and-h and IHS coincides with that of a generalized (three-parameter) lognormal (LN*) distribution. The increased skewness kurtosis flexibility of the g-and-h distribution, for h < 0, relative to the IHS is obtained by introducing vertical asymptotes, compact support, and possibly U-shaped pdf's. This increased coverage, however, may not be helpful if the data are unimodal. Empirical daily, weekly, and monthly stock return data are used to compare the descriptive ability Of the IHS, g-and-h, and LN* distributions.","g-and-h,Generalized lognormal,Inverse hyperbolic sine,Kurtosis,Skewness,Stock returns","STOCK-RETURN DISTRIBUTIONS,ELONGATION,SKEWNESS,OPTIONS,PRICES","McDonald, James B.@Brigham Young Univ, Provo, UT 84602 USA::Turley, Patrick@Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","McDonald, James B.@Brigham Young University::Turley, Patrick@Harvard University",not exist,"ON MEASURING SKEWNESS AND ELONGATION IN COMMON-STOCK RETURN DISTRIBUTIONS - THE CASE OF THE MARKET INDEX+BADRINATH, SG; CHATTERJEE, S+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS+OCT 1988::A DATA-ANALYTIC LOOK AT SKEWNESS AND ELONGATION IN COMMON-STOCK-RETURN DISTRIBUTIONS+BADRINATH, SG; CHATTERJEE, S+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+APR 1991::PRICING OF OPTIONS AND CORPORATE LIABILITIES+BLACK, F; SCHOLES, M+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+1973::no title+Cox, D.

A Practical Way for Computing Approximate Lower and Upper Correlation Bounds,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2011.10090,MAY 2011,15,24,"Correlations among variables are typically not free to vary between -1 and 1, with bounds determined by the marginal distributions. Computing upper and lower limits of correlations given the marginal characteristics often raises theoretical and computational challenges. We propose a simple sorting technique that is predicated upon a little-known consequence of a well-established fact from statistical distribution theory to obtain approximate correlation bounds. This approach works regardless of the data type or distribution. We believe that it has practical value in appropriately specifying the correlation structure in simulation studies.","Correlation limits,Simulation,Sorting","RANDOM-VARIABLES,DISTRIBUTIONS","Demirtas, Hakan@Univ Illinois, Div Epidemiol & Biostat MC923, Chicago, IL 60612 USA::Hedeker, Donald@Univ Illinois, Div Epidemiol & Biostat MC923, Chicago, IL 60612 USA","Demirtas, Hakan@University of Illinois Chicago Hospital@University of Illinois Chicago@University of Illinois System::Hedeker, Donald@University of Illinois Chicago Hospital@University of Illinois Chicago@University of Illinois System",not exist,"A method for multivariate ordinal data generation given marginal distributions and correlations+Demirtas, H+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+NOV 2006::Multiple imputation under power polynomials+Demirtas, Hakan; Hedeker, Donald+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+2008::PRESCRIBING A SYSTEM OF RANDOM VARIABLES BY CONDITIONAL DISTRIBUTIONS+DOBRUSHIN, RL+THEORY OF PROBILITY AND ITS APPLICATIONS,USSR+1970::A METHOD FOR GENERATING HIGH-DIMENSIONAL MULTIVARIATE BINARY VARIATES+EMRICH, LJ; PIEDMONTE, MR+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+NOV 1991::METHOD FOR SIMULATING NON-NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS+FLEISHMAN, AI+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1978::Sur les tableaux de correlation dont les marges sont donnes+Frechet, M.+Annales de lUniversite de Lyon Section A, Series+1951::A lower bound for the correlation of exponentiated bivariate normal pairs+Greenland, S+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1996::no title+Headrick, T.

Using Infer.NET for Statistical Analyses,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2011.10169,MAY 2011,22,10,"We demonstrate and critique the new Bayesian inference package Infer.NET in terms of its capacity for statistical analyses. Infer.NET differs from the well-known BUGS Bayesian inference packages in that its main engine is the variational Bayes family of deterministic approximation algorithms rather than Markov chain Monte Carlo. The underlying rationale is that such deterministic algorithms can handle bigger problems due to their increased speed, despite some loss of accuracy. We find that Infer.NET is a well-designed computational framework and offers significant speed advantages over BUGS. Nevertheless, the current release is limited in terms of the breadth of models it can handle, and its inference is sometimes inaccurate.

In a range of plausible situations, giving priority to main effects in structured testing typically yielded greater power to detect main effects for a given sample size or reduced sample size for a given power; it also permitted testing for interaction when main effects are found.","Factorial experiment,Familywise error rate,Multiple testing,Ordered family of hypotheses","CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS,CLINICAL-TRIALS,MULTIPLE,EQUIVALENCE,HYPOTHESES,DIFFERENCE,PRINCIPLE,ORDER","Small, Dylan S.@Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Dept Stat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA::Volpp, Kevin G.@Univ Penn, Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA@Univ Penn, Leonard Davis Inst Hlth Econ, Ctr Hlth Incent, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA::Rosenbaum, Paul R.@Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Dept Stat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Small, Dylan S.@University of Pennsylvania::Volpp, Kevin G.@University of Pennsylvania::Rosenbaum, Paul R.@University of Pennsylvania","Rosenbaum, Paul@H-8687-2012","A note on multiple testing procedures in dose finding+Bauer, P+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1997::A unifying approach for confidence intervals and testing of equivalence and difference+Bauer, P; Kieser, M+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1996::MULTI-PARAMETER HYPOTHESIS-TESTING AND ACCEPTANCE SAMPLING+BERGER, RL+TECHNOMETRICS+1982::Simvastatin and niacin, antioxidant vitamins, or the combination for the prevention of coronary disease+Brown, BG; Zhao, XQ; Chait, A; et al.+NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE+NOV 29 2001::FACTORIAL-DESIGNS FOR RANDOMIZED CLINICAL-TRIALS+BYAR, DP; PIANTADOSI, S+CANCER TREATMENT REPORTS+1985::Multiple testing along a tree+Ehm, Werner; Kornmeier, Juergen; Heinrich, Sven P.+ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+2010::STATISTICAL ISSUES ARISING IN AIDS CLINICAL-TRIALS+ELLENBERG, SS; FINKELSTEIN, DM; SCHOENFELD, DA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1992::The partitioning principle: A powerful tool in multiple decision theory+Finner, H; Strassburger, K+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+AUG 2002::no title+FINOS L+BIOMETRICS IN PRESS+2010::THE SEQUENTIAL REJECTION PRINCIPLE OF FAMILYWISE ERROR CONTROL+Goeman, Jelle J.; Solari, Aldo+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 2010::no title+Hochberg, Y.; Tamhane, A.C.+Multiple Comparison Procedures+1987::A SIMPLE SEQUENTIALLY REJECTIVE MULTIPLE TEST PROCEDURE+HOLM, S+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+1979::Tests for differentiation in gene expression using a data-driven order or weights for hypotheses+Hommel, G; Kropf, S+BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL+AUG 2005::Powerful short-cuts for multiple testing procedures with special reference to gatekeeping strategies+Hommel, Gerhard; Bretz, Frank; Maurer, Willi+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+SEP 30 2007::no title+HSU JC+J AM STAT ASSOC+1999::no title+KOCH GG+DRUG INF J+1996::no title+Lehmann, E.L.; Romano, J.P.+Testing Statistical Hypotheses+2005::TESTING MULTIPARAMETER HYPOTHESES+LEHMANN, EL+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1952::CLOSED TESTING PROCEDURES WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO ORDERED ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE+MARCUS, R; PERITZ, E; GABRIEL, KR+BIOMETRIKA+1976::Hierarchical testing of variable importance+Meinshausen, Nicolai+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 2008::no title+Miller, R.

Efficient Classification-Based Relabeling in Mixture Models,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/tast.2011.10170,FEB 2011,17,20,"Effective component relabeling in Bayesian analyses of mixture models is critical to the routine use of mixtures in classification with analysis based on Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The classification-based relabeling approach here is computationally attractive and statistically effective, and scales well with sample size and number of mixture components concordant with enabling routine analyses of increasingly large datasets. Building on the best of existing methods, practical relabeling aims to match data:component classification indicators in MCMC iterates with those of a defined reference mixture distribution. The method performs as well as or better than existing methods in small dimensional problems, while being practically superior in problems with larger datasets as the approach is scalable. We describe examples and computational benchmarks, and provide supporting code with efficient computational implementation of the algorithm that will be of use to others in practical applications of mixture models.","Bayesian computation,GPU computing,Hungarian algorithm,Large datasets,Markov chain Monte Carlo,Mixture configuration indicators","FLOW-CYTOMETRY,INFERENCE,DENSITY","Cron, Andrew J.@Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA::West, Mike@Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Cron, Andrew J.@Duke University::West, Mike@Duke University",not exist,"Mixture modeling approach to flow cytometry data+Boedigheimer, Michael J.; Ferbas, John+CYTOMETRY PART A+MAY 2008::Statistical mixture modeling for cell subtype identification in flow cytometry+Chan, Cliburn; Feng, Feng; Ottinger, Janet; et al.+CYTOMETRY PART A+AUG 2008::BAYESIAN DENSITY-ESTIMATION AND INFERENCE USING MIXTURES+ESCOBAR, MD; WEST, M+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1995::Gibbs sampling methods for stick-breaking priors+Ishwaran, H; James, LF+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2001::Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and the label switching problem in Bayesian mixture modeling+Jasra, A; Holmes, CC; Stephens, DA+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+FEB 2005::Spatial Mixture Modelling for Unobserved Point Processes: Examples in Immunofluorescence Histology+Ji, Chunlin; Merl, Daniel; Kepler, Thomas B.; et al.+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2009::Bayesian model-based clustering procedures+Lau, J.; Green, P.+Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics+2006::A BAYESIAN METHOD FOR CLASSIFICATION AND DISCRIMINATION+LAVINE, M; WEST, M+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+DEC 1992::no title+LIN L+1023 DUK U DEP STAT+2010::Computational methods for mixture of Dirichlet process models+MacEachern, S.N.+Practical Nonparametric and Semiparametric Bayesian Statistics+1998::Estimating mixture of Dirichlet process models+MacEachern, SN; Muller, P+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+JUN 1998::Selection Sampling from Large Data Sets for Targeted Inference in Mixture Modeling+Manolopoulou, Ioanna; Chan, Cliburn; West, Mike+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2010::ALGORITHMS FOR THE ASSIGNMENT AND TRANSPORTATION PROBLEMS+MUNKRES, J+JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR INDUSTRIAL AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS+1957::Dealing with label switching in mixture models+Stephens, M+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2000::Understanding GPU Programming for Statistical Computation: Studies in Massively Parallel Massive Mixtures+Suchard, Marc A.; Wang, Quanli; Chan, Cliburn; et al.+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+JUN 2010::Hierarchical mixture models in neurological transmission analysis+West, M+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1997::Bayesian Mixture Labeling by Highest Posterior Density+Yao, Weixin; Lindsay, Bruce G.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2009"
Facilitating the Calculation of the Efficient Score Using Symbolic Computing,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2017.1392361,2018,32,0,"The score statistic continues to be a fundamental tool for statistical inference. In the analysis of data from high-throughput genomic assays, inference on the basis of the score usually enjoys greater stability, considerably higher computational efficiency, and lends itself more readily to the use of resampling methods than the asymptotically equivalent Wald or likelihood ratio tests. The score function often depends on a set of unknown nuisance parameters which have to be replaced by estimators, but can be improved by calculating the efficient score, which accounts for the variability induced by estimating these parameters. Manual derivation of the efficient score is tedious and error-prone, so we illustrate using computer algebra to facilitate this derivation. We demonstrate this process within the context of a standard example from genetic association analyses, though the techniques shown here could be applied to any derivation, and have a place in the toolbox of any modern statistician. We further show how the resulting symbolic expressions can be readily ported to compiled languages, to develop fast numerical algorithms for high-throughput genomic analysis. We conclude by considering extensions of this approach.

Testing for Serial Independence: Beyond the Portmanteau Approach,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2016.1264314,2018,30,0,"Portmanteau tests are typically used to test serial independence even if, by construction, they are generally powerful only in presence of pairwise dependence between lagged variables. In this article, we present a simple statistic defining a new serial independence test, which is able to detect more general forms of dependence. In particular, differently from the Portmanteau tests, the resulting test is powerful also under a dependent process characterized by pairwise independence. A diagram, based on p-values from the proposed test, is introduced to investigate serial dependence. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposal is evaluated in a simulation study and with an application on financial data. Both show that the new test, used in synergy with the existing ones, helps in the identification of the true data-generating process.

Structural Equation Models for Dealing With Spatial Confounding,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2017.1305290,2018,22,0,"In regression analyses of spatially structured data, it is common practice to introduce spatially correlated random effects into the regression model to reduce or even avoid unobserved variable bias in the estimation of other covariate effects. If besides the response the covariates are also spatially correlated, the spatial effects may confound the effect of the covariates or vice versa. In this case, the model fails to identify the true covariate effect due to multicollinearity. For highly collinear continuous covariates, path analysis and structural equation modeling techniques prove to be helpful to disentangle direct covariate effects from indirect covariate effects arising from correlation with other variables. This work discusses the applicability of these techniques in regression setups, where spatial and covariate effects coincide at least partly and classical geoadditive models fail to separate these effects.

Predicting Home Run Production in Major League Baseball Using a Bayesian Semiparametric Model,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2017.1401959,2018,26,0,"This article attempts to predict home run hitting performance of Major League Baseball players using a Bayesian semiparametric model. Following Berry, Reese and Larkey we include in the model effects for era of birth, season of play, and home ball park. We estimate performance curves for each player using orthonormal quartic polynomials. We use a Dirichlet process prior on the unknown distribution for the coefficients of the polynomials, and parametric priors for the other effects. Dirichlet process priors are useful in prediction for two reasons: (1) an increased probability of obtaining more precise prediction comes with the increased flexibility of the prior specification, and (2) the clustering inherent in the Dirichlet process provides the means to share information across players. Data from 1871 to 2008 were used to fit the model. Data from 2009 to 2016 were used to test the predictive ability of the model. A parametric model was also fit to compare the predictive performance of the models. We used what we called pure performance curves to predict future performance for 22 players. The nonparametric method provided superior predictive performance.","Dirichlet process prior,Orthonormal polynomials,Performance curves,Prediction","SAMPLING METHODS,INFERENCE,MIXTURE","Fellingham, Gilbert W.@Brigham Young Univ, Dept Stat, 210 TMCB, Provo, UT 84602 USA::Fisher, Jared D.@Univ Texas Austin, Dept Informat Risk & Operat Management, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Fellingham, Gilbert W.@Brigham Young University::Fisher, Jared D.@University of Texas Austin@University of Texas System",not exist,"A STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS OF HITTING STREAKS IN BASEBALL+ALBRIGHT, SC+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1993::no title+no author+Baseball Encyclopedia of Players+2017::Bridging different eras in sports+Berry, SM; Reese, CS; Larkey, PD+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1999::FERGUSON DISTRIBUTIONS VIA POLYA URN SCHEMES+BLACKWELL, D; MACQUEEN, JB+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1973::Approaches for statistical inference+Carlin, Bradley P.; Louis, Thomas A.+BAYESIAN METHODS FOR DATA ANALYSIS, THIRD EDITION+2009::Multiple hypothesis testing by clustering treatment effects+Dahl, David B.; Newton, Michael A.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2007::BAYESIAN DENSITY-ESTIMATION AND INFERENCE USING MIXTURES+ESCOBAR, MD; WEST, M+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1995::Bayesian nonparametric predictive modeling of group health claims+Fellingham, Gilbert W.; Kottas, Athanasios; Hartman, Brian M.+INSURANCE MATHEMATICS &amp; ECONOMICS+JAN 2015::BAYESIAN ANALYSIS OF SOME NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS+FERGUSON, TS+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1973::Introduction to the Dirichlet Distribution and Related Processes+Frigyik, B.

The Landscape of Causal Inference: Perspective From Citation Network Analysis,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2017.1360794,2018,93,0,"Causal inference is a fast-growing multidisciplinary field that has drawn extensive interests from statistical sciences and health and social sciences. In this article, we gather comprehensive information on publications and citations in causal inference and provide a review of the field from the perspective of citation network analysis. We provide descriptive analyses by showing the most cited publications, the most prolific and the most cited authors, and structural properties of the citation network. Then, we examine the citation network through exponential random graph models (ERGMs). We show that both technical aspects of the publications (e.g., publication length, time and quality) and social processes such as homophily (the tendency to cite publications in the same field or with shared authors), cumulative advantage, and transitivity (the tendency to cite references' references), matter for citations. We also provide specific analysis of citations among the top authors in the field and present a ranking and clustering of the authors. Overall, our article reveals new insights into the landscape of the field of causal inference and may serve as a case study for analyzing citation networks in a multidisciplinary field and for fitting ERGMs on big networks.

The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney Procedure Fails as a Test of Medians,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2017.1305291,2018,24,1,"To illustrate and document the tenuous connection between the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney (WMW) procedure and medians, its relationship to mean ranks is first contrasted with the relationship of a t-test to means. The quantity actually tested: (Pr) over cap (X-1 < X-2) + <(Pr)over cap>(X-1 = X-2)/2 is then described and recommended as the basis for an alternative summary statistic that can be employed instead of medians. In order to graphically represent an estimate of the quantity: Pr(X-1 < X-2) + Pr(X-1 = X-2)/2, use of a bubble plot, an ROC curve and a dominance diagramare illustrated. Several counter-examples (real and constructed) are presented, all demonstrating that theWMWprocedure fails to be a test ofmedians. The discussion also addresses another, less commonand perhaps less clear cut, but potentially even more importantmisconception: that theWMW procedure requires continuous data in order to be valid. Discussion of other issues surrounding the question of the WMW procedure and medians is presented, along with the authors' teaching experience with the topic.

Often, the values of physical variables in an engineering model are interrelated. This mutual dependence imposes inequality constraints on the random variables representing these parameters. Ignoring the interdependencies and sampling the variables independently can lead to inconsistency/bias. We propose an algorithm to generate samples of constrained random variables that are characterized by typical continuous probability distributions and are subject to different kinds of inequality constraints.

The sample correlation matrix of the predictors is then the basic tool for describing approximate linear combinations that may distort the conclusions of a standard least-square analysis. However, as indicated by several authors, centering may eventually fail to detect the sources of ill-conditioning. In spite of this earlier claim, there does not seem to be in the literature a fully clear explanation of the reasons for this bad potential behavior of the traditional strategy for analyzing collinearity. This note studies this issue in some detail. Results derived are motivated by the analysis of a well-known real dataset.

Visualizing Type II Error in Normality Tests,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2016.1278035,2018,6,1,"A skewed exponential power distribution, with parameters defining kurtosis and skewness, is introduced as a way to visualize Type II error in normality tests. By varying these parameters a mosaic of distributions is built, ranging from double exponential to uniform or from positive to negative exponential; the normal distribution is a particular case located in the center of the mosaic. Using a sequential color scheme, a different color is assigned to each distribution in the mosaic depending on the probability of committing a Type II error. This graph gives a visual representation of the power of the performed test. This way of representing results facilitates the comparison of the power of various tests and the influence of sample size.

On the Gaussian Mixture Representation of the Laplace Distribution,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2017.1291448,2018,16,0,"Under certain conditions, a symmetric unimodal continuous random variable xi can be represented as a scale mixture of a standard Normal distribution Z, that is, xi = root WZ, where the mixing distribution W is independent of Z. It is well known that if the mixing distribution is inverse Gamma, then xi has Student's t distribution. However, it is less well known that if the mixing distribution is Gamma, then xi has a Laplace distribution. Several existing proofs of the latter result rely on complex calculus or nontrivial change of variables in integrals. We offer two simple and intuitive proofs based on representation and moment generating functions. As a byproduct, our proof by representation makes connections to many existing results in statistics.

Estimating Desired Sample Size for Simple Random Sampling of a Skewed Population,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2017.1290548,2018,11,0,"A simulation study was conducted to assess how well the necessary sample size to achieve a stipulated margin of error can be estimated prior to sampling. Our concern was particularly focused on performance when sampling from a very skewed distribution, which is a common feature of many biological, economic, and other populations. We examined two approaches for estimating sample size-one being the commonly used strategy aimed at regulating the average magnitude of the stipulated margin of error and the second being a previously proposed strategy to control the tolerance probability with which the stipulated margin of error is exceeded. Results of the simulation revealed that (1) skewness does not much affect the average estimated sample size but can greatly extend the range of estimated sample sizes; and (2) skewness does reduce the effectiveness of Kupper and Hafner's sample size estimator, yet its effectiveness is negatively impacted less by skewness directly, and to a much greater degree by the common practice of estimating the population variance via a pilot sampling from the skewed population. Nonetheless, the simulations suggest that estimating sample size to control the probability with which the desired margin of error is achieved is a worthwhile alternative to the usual sample size formula that controls the average width of the confidence interval only.","Confidence interval estimation,Margin of error,Tolerance probability",,"Gregoire, Timothy G.@Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06520 USA::Affleck, David L.

A New Lens on High School Dropout: Use of Correspondence Analysis and the Statewide Longitudinal Data System,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2017.1322002,2018,36,1,"The combination of log-linear models and correspondence analysis have long been used to decompose contingency tables and aid in their interpretation. Until now, this approach has not been applied to the education Statewide Longitudinal Data System (SLDS), which contains administrative school data at the student level. While some research has been conducted using the SLDS, its primary use is for state education administrative reporting. This article uses the combination of log-linear models and correspondence analysis to gain insight into high school dropouts in two discrete regions in Kentucky, Appalachia and non-Appalachia, defined by the American Community Survey. The individual student records from the SLDS were categorized into one of the two regions and a log-linear model was used to identify the interactions between the demographic characteristics and the dropout categories, push-out and pull-out. Correspondence analysis was then used to visualize the interactions with the expanded push-out categories, boredom, course selection, expulsion, failing grade, teacher conflict, and pull-out categories, employment, family problems, illness, marriage, and pregnancy to provide insights into the regional differences. In this article, we demonstrate that correspondence analysis can extend the insights gained from SDLS data and provide new perspectives on dropouts.

Forecasting at Scale,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2017.1380080,2018,18,1,"Forecasting is a common data science task that helps organizations with capacity planning, goal setting, and anomaly detection. Despite its importance, there are serious challenges associated with producing reliable and high-quality forecasts-especially when there are a variety of time series and analysts with expertise in time series modeling are relatively rare. To address these challenges, we describe a practical approach to forecasting ""at scale"" that combines configurable models with analyst-in-the-loop performance analysis. We propose a modular regression model with interpretable parameters that can be intuitively adjusted by analysts with domain knowledge about the time series. We describe performance analyses to compare and evaluate forecasting procedures, and automatically flag forecasts for manual review and adjustment. Tools that help analysts to use their expertise most effectively enable reliable, practical forecasting of business time series.","Nonlinear regression,Statistical practice,Time series","TIME-SERIES,REGRESSION,ALGORITHM,MODELS,STATE","Taylor, Sean J.@Facebook, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA::Letham, Benjamin@Facebook, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA","Taylor, Sean J.@Unknow::Letham, Benjamin@Unknow",not exist,"A LIMITED MEMORY ALGORITHM FOR BOUND CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION+BYRD, RH; LU, PH; NOCEDAL, J; et al.+SIAM JOURNAL ON SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING+SEP 1995::Stan: A Probabilistic Programming Language+Carpenter, Bob; Gelman, Andrew; Hoffman, Matthew D.; et al.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL SOFTWARE+JAN 2017::LOCALLY WEIGHTED REGRESSION - AN APPROACH TO REGRESSION-ANALYSIS BY LOCAL FITTING+CLEVELAND, WS; DEVLIN, SJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1988::25 years of time series forecasting+De Gooijer, Jan G.; Hyndman, Rob J.+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+2006::Forecasting Time Series With Complex Seasonal Patterns Using Exponential Smoothing+De Livera, Alysha M.; Hyndman, Rob J.; Snyder, Ralph D.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2011::AN ISOTONIC REGRESSION ALGORITHM+DYKSTRA, RL+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+1981::EXPONENTIAL SMOOTHING - THE STATE OF THE ART+GARDNER, ES+JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+1985::ESTIMATION PROCEDURES FOR STRUCTURAL TIME-SERIES MODELS+HARVEY, AC; PETERS, S+JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+MAR-APR 1990::Structural time series models+Harvey, AC; Shephard, N.+HDB STAT+1993::GENERALIZED ADDITIVE-MODELS - SOME APPLICATIONS+HASTIE, T; TIBSHIRANI, R+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1987::no title+Hutchinson, G.

Documenting and Evaluating Data Science Contributions in Academic Promotion in Departments of Statistics and Biostatistics,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2017.1375988,2018,9,0,"The dynamic intersection of the field of Data Science with the established academic communities of Statistics and Biostatistics continues to generate lively debate, often with the two fields playing the role of an upstart (but brilliant), tech-savvy prodigy and an established (but brilliant), curmudgeonly expert, respectively. Like any emerging discipline, Data Science brings new perspectives and new tools to address new questions requiring new perspectives on traditionally established concepts. We explore a specific component of this discussion, namely the documentation and evaluation of Data Science-related research, teaching, and service contributions for facultymembers seeking promotion and tenurewithin traditional departments of Statistics and Biostatistics. We focus on three perspectives: the department chair nominating a candidate for promotion, the junior faculty member going up for promotion, and the senior faculty members evaluating the promotion package. We contrast conservative, strategic, and iconoclastic approaches to promotion based on accomplishments in data science.","Academic promotion,Team science,Tenure",,"Waller, Lance A.@Emory Univ, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat & Bioinformat, 1518 Clifton Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA","Waller, Lance A.@Rollins School Public Health@Emory University","Waller, Lance@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5002-8886","no title+no author+Mathematical Association of America's , Guidelines for Programs and Departments of Mathematical Sciences+2000::no title+Boyer, E.

"Excuse Me, Do You Have a Moment to Talk About Version Control?",AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2017.1399928,2018,14,0,"Data analysis, statistical research, and teaching statistics have at least one thing in common: these activities all produce many files! There are data files, source code, figures, tables, prepared reports, and much more. Most of these files evolve over the course of a project and often need to be shared with others, for reading or edits, as a project unfolds. Without explicit and structured management, project organization can easily descend into chaos, taking time away from the primary work and reducing the quality of the final product. This unhappy result can be avoided by repurposing tools and workflows from the software development world, namely, distributed version control. This article describes the use of the version control system Git and the hosting site GitHub for statistical and data scientific workflows. Special attention is given to projects that use the statistical language R and, optionally, RMarkdown documents.

Based on the C language, it uses a number of macros and other low-level constructs to exchange data structures between the R process and any dynamically loaded component modules authors added to it. With the introduction of the Rcpp package, and its later refinements, this process has become considerably easier yet also more robust. By now, Rcpp has become the most popular extension mechanism for R. This article introduces Rcpp, and illustrates with several examples how the Rcpp Attributes mechanism in particular eases the transition of objects between R and C++ code.

Modeling Offensive Player Movement in Professional Basketball,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2017.1395365,2018,9,0,"The 2013 arrival of SportVU player tracking data in all NBA arenas introduced an overwhelming amount of on-court information-information which the league is still learning how to maximize for insights into player performance and basketball strategy. The data contain the spatial coordinates for the ball and every player on the court for 25 frames per second, which opens up avenues of player and team performance analysis that was not possible before this technology existed. This article serves as a step-by-step guide for how to leverage a data feed from SportVU for one NBA game into visualizable components that can model any player's movement on offense. We detail some utility functions that are helpful for manipulating SportVU data before applying it to the task of visualizing player offensive movement. We conclude with visualizations of the resulting output for one NBA game, as well as what the results look like aggregated across an entire season for three NBA stars with very different offensive tendencies.","Data science,Data visualization,Sports statistics",,"Wu, Steven@Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Sacramento Kings, Burnaby, BC, Canada::Bornn, Luke@Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Sacramento Kings, Burnaby, BC, Canada","Wu, Steven@Simon Fraser University::Bornn, Luke@Simon Fraser University",not exist,"no title+Cervone, D.; D'Amour, A.; Bornn, L.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Goldsberry, K</span>.+A Multiresolution Stochastic Process Model for Predicting Basketball Possession Outcomes+2016::no title+D'Amour, A.; Cervone, D.; Bornn, L.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Goldsberry, K</span>.+Move or Die: How Ball Movement Creates Open Shots in the NBA+2015::no title+Forsyth, D.+Exploring NBA Data in Python+2015::no title+Franks, A.; Miller, A.; Bornn, L.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Goldsberry, K</span>.+Characterizing the Spatial Structure of Defensive Skill in Professional Basketball+2015::no title+Franks, A.; Miller, A.; Bornn, L.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Goldsberry, K</span>.+Counterpoints: Advanced Defensive Metrics for NBA Basketball+2015::no title+Gallic, E.+Drawing a Basketball Court With r+2014::Geographic Data Analysis and Modeling+Hijmans, R.

As computer-based research has increased in complexity, so have the challenges of ensuring that this research is reproducible. To address this challenge, we review the concept of the research compendium as a solution for providing a standard and easily recognizable way for organizing the digital materials of a research project to enable other researchers to inspect, reproduce, and extend the research. We investigate how the structure and tooling of software packages of the R programming language are being used to produce research compendia in a variety of disciplines. We also describe how software engineering tools and services are being used by researchers to streamline working with research compendia. Using real-world examples, we show how researchers can improve the reproducibility of their work using research compendia based on R packages and related tools.","Computational science,Data science,Open source software,Reproducible research","NORTHERN AUSTRALIA,STRATEGIES,THAILAND,CULTURE,TOOLS","Marwick, Ben@Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA::Boettiger, Carl@Univ Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia::Mullen, Lincoln@Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA@George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA","Marwick, Ben@University of Washington@University of Washington Seattle::Boettiger, Carl@University of Wollongong::Mullen, Lincoln@University of California System@George Mason University@University of California Berkeley","Mullen, Lincoln@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5103-6917","Estimating the reproducibility of psychological science+Aarts, Alexander A.; Anderson, Joanna E.; Anderson, Christopher J.; et al.+SCIENCE+AUG 28 2015::no title+Allaire, J.; Foundation, R; Wickham, H.+rticles, R package, version 0. 4. 1+2017::no title+Allaire, J.

Efficient Computation of Reduced Regression Models,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2017.1296375,MAY 2017,12,0,"We consider settings where it is of interest to fit and assess regression submodels that arise as various explanatory variables are excluded from a larger regression model. The larger model is referred to as the full model; the submodels are the reduced models. We show that a computationally efficient approximation to the regression estimates under any reduced model can be obtained from a simple weighted least squares (WLS) approach based on the estimated regression parameters and covariance matrix from the full model. This WLS approach can be considered an extension to unbiased estimating equations of a first-order Taylor series approach proposed by Lawless and Singhal. Using data from the 2010 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), a 20% weighted, stratified, cluster sample of approximately 8 million hospital stays from approximately 1000 hospitals, we illustrate the WLS approach when fitting interval censored regression models to estimate the effect of type of surgery (robotic versus nonrobotic surgery) on hospital length-of-stay while adjusting for three sets of covariates: patient-level characteristics, hospital characteristics, and zip-code level characteristics. Ordinarily, standard fitting of the reduced models to the NIS data takes approximately 10 hours; using the proposed WLS approach, the reduced models take seconds to fit.","Complementary log log regression,c survey,Weighted estimating equations,Weighted least squares",,"Lipsitz, Stuart R.@Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA::Fitzmaurice, Garrett M.@Harvard Med Sch, Dept Psychiat, Boston, MA USA::Sinha, Debajyoti@Florida State Univ, Dept Stat, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA::Hevelone, Nathanael@Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Surg, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA::Giovannucci, Edward@Harvard Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Nutr, Boston, MA USA@Harvard Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Boston, MA USA::Quoc-Dien Trinh@Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Urol, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA::Hu, Jim C.@Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Urol, New York, NY USA","Lipsitz, Stuart R.@Harvard University::Fitzmaurice, Garrett M.@Harvard University::Sinha, Debajyoti@State University System of Florida@Florida State University::Hevelone, Nathanael@Harvard University::Giovannucci, Edward@Harvard University::Quoc-Dien Trinh@Harvard University::Hu, Jim C.@Cornell University@Weill Cornell Medical College",not exist,"Fitting Cox's Proportional Hazards Models From Survey Data+[Anonymous].+Biometrika+1992::New Technology and Health Care Costs - The Case of Robot-Assisted Surgery+Barbash, Gabriel I.; Glied, Sherry A.+NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE+AUG 19 2010::ON THE VARIANCES OF ASYMPTOTICALLY NORMAL ESTIMATORS FROM COMPLEX SURVEYS+BINDER, DA+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+1983::REGRESSION MODELS AND LIFE-TABLES+COX, DR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1972::Survey inference for subpopulations+Graubard, BI; Korn, EL+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+JUL 1 1996::Efficient screening of covariates in population models using Wald's approximation to the likelihood ratio test+Kowalski, KG; Hutmacher, MM+JOURNAL OF PHARMACOKINETICS AND PHARMACODYNAMICS+JUN 2001::EFFICIENT SCREENING OF NONNORMAL REGRESSION-MODELS+LAWLESS, JF; SINGHAL, K+BIOMETRICS+1978::LONGITUDINAL DATA-ANALYSIS USING GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS+LIANG, KY; ZEGER, SL+BIOMETRIKA+APR 1986::EXPERIMENTAL SURVIVAL CURVES FOR INTERVAL-CENSORED DATA+PETO, R+THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+1973::REGRESSION-ANALYSIS OF GROUPED SURVIVAL DATA WITH APPLICATION TO BREAST-CANCER DATA+PRENTICE, RL; GLOECKLER, LA+BIOMETRICS+1978::no title+no author+SAS statistical software (Version 9. 4) .+2015::THE ANALYSIS OF RELAPSE CLINICAL-TRIALS, WITH APPLICATION TO A COMPARISON OF 2 ULCER TREATMENTS+WHITEHEAD, J+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+DEC 1989"

Based on approximately 2.2 million pitches taken from the 2013, 2014, and 2015 MLB seasons, the quality of a particular pitch is evaluated as the expected number of bases conceded. Quality is expressed as a function of various covariates including pitch count, pitch location, pitch type, and pitch speed. The estimation of the pitch quality is obtained through the use of random forest methodology to accommodate the inherent complexity of the relationship between pitch quality and the associated covariates. With the fitted model, various applications are considered which provide new insights on pitching and batting.","Machine learning,PITCHf/x data,Random forests",,"Swartz, Philippa@Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada::Grosskopf, Mike@Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada::Bingham, Derek@Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada::Swartz, Tim B.@Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada","Swartz, Philippa@Simon Fraser University::Grosskopf, Mike@Simon Fraser University::Bingham, Derek@Simon Fraser University::Swartz, Tim B.@Simon Fraser University",not exist,"Looking Ahead: A Bright Future for JQAS+Albert, J.+Journal of Quantitative Analysis in Sports+2012::The Many Flavors of DIPS: A History and an Overview+Basco, D.; Davies, M.+Society for American Baseball Research, Baseball Research Journal+2010::Sabermetric Revolution: Assessing the Growth of Analytics in Baseball+Baumer, B; Zimbalist, A+SABERMETRIC REVOLUTION: ASSESSING THE GROWTH OF ANALYTICS IN BASEBALL+2014::Modeling Spatial Batting Ability using a Known Covariance Matrix+Cross, J.; Sylvan, D.+Journal of Quantitative Analysis in Sports+2015::Bringing the Heat.

Reversals of Least-Square Estimates and Model-Invariant Estimation for Directions of Unique Effects,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2016.1226951,MAY 2017,43,1,"When a linear model is adjusted to control for additional explanatory variables, the sign of a fitted coefficient may reverse. Here, these reversals are studied using coefficients, of determination. The resulting theory can be used to determine directions of unique effects in the presence of model uncertainty. This process is called model-invariant estimation when the estimates are invariant across changes to the model structure. When a single covariate is added, the reversal region can be understood geometrically as an elliptical cone of two nappes with an axis of symmetry relating to a best-possible condition for a reversal using a single coefficient of determination. When a set of covariates are added to a model with a single explanatory variable, model invariant estimation can be implemented using subject matter knowledge. More general theory with partial coefficients is applicable to analysis of large datasets. Applications are demonstrated with dietary health data from the United Nations.","Confounding,Regression,Sensitivity analysis","INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES,CLEARER DEFINITION,SIGN CHANGES,SENSITIVITY,CONFOUNDERS,COEFFICIENT","Knaeble, Brian@Utah Valley Univ, Dept Math, Orem, UT 84058 USA::Dutter, Seth@Univ Wisconsin Stout, Dept MSCS, Menomonie, WI USA","Knaeble, Brian@Utah Valley University@Utah System of Higher Education::Dutter, Seth@University of Wisconsin System@University of Wisconsin Stout",not exist,"no title+no author+Health Effects of Exposure to Radon+1999::Bone mass density selectively correlates with serum markers of oxidative damage in post-menopausal women+Cervellati, Carlo; Bonaccorsi, Gloria; Cremonini, Eleonora; et al.+CLINICAL CHEMISTRY AND LABORATORY MEDICINE+FEB 2013::MODEL UNCERTAINTY, DATA MINING AND STATISTICAL-INFERENCE+CHATFIELD, C+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1995::The omission or addition of an independent variate in multiple linear regression.+COCHRAN, W.

Using this as a starting point, similarities between frequentist confidence intervals for proportions and Bayesian credible intervals based on low-informative priors are studied using asymptotic expansions. A Bayesian motivation for a large class of frequentist confidence intervals is provided. It is shown that the likelihood ratio interval for p approximates a Bayesian credible interval based on Kerman's neutral noninformative conjugate prior up to O(n(-1)) in the confidence bounds. For the significance level alpha less than or similar to 0.317, the. Bayesian interval based on the Jeffreys' prior is then shown to be a compromise between the likelihood ratio and Wilson intervals.

The Target Parameter of Adjusted R-Squared in Fixed-Design Experiments,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2016.1200489,MAY 2017,10,1,"R-squared (R-2) and adjusted R-squared (R-Adj(2)) are sometimes viewed as statistics detached from any target parameter, and sometimes as estimators for the population multiple correlation. The latter interpretation is meaningful only if the explanatory variables are random. This article proposes an alternative perspective for the case where the x's are fixed. A new parameter is defined, in a similar fashion to the construction of R-2, but relying on the true parameters rather than their estimates. (The parameter definition includes also the fixed x values.) This parameter is referred to as the ""parametric"" coefficient of determination, and denoted by rho(2)(*). The proposed rho(2)(*) remains stable when irrelevant variables are removed (or added), unlike the unadjusted R-2, which always goes up when variables, either relevant or not, are added to the model (and goes down when they are removed). The value of the traditional R-Adj(2) may go up or down with added (or removed) variables, either relevant or not. It is shown that the unadjusted R-2 overestimates rho(2)(*) while the traditional R-Adj(2) underestimates it. It is also shown that for simple linear regression the magnitude of the bias of R-Adj(2) can be as high as the bias of the unadjusted R-2 (while their signs are opposite). Asymptotic convergence in probability of R-Adj(2) to rho(2)(*) is demonstrated. The effects of model parameters on the bias of R-2 and R-Adj(2) are characterized analytically and numerically. An alternative bi-adjusted estimator is presented and evaluated.","Adjusted R-squared,Linear regression,Multiple correlation shrinkage",SHRINKAGE,"Bar-Gera, Hillel@Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Ind Engn & Management, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel","Bar-Gera, Hillel@Ben Gurion University",not exist,"no title+Draper, N.

A Bayesian Analysis of Synchronous Distance Learning versus Matched Traditional Control in Graduate Biostatistics Courses,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2016.1247014,MAY 2017,47,0,"Distance learning can be useful for bridging geographical barriers to education in rural settings. However, empirical evidence on the equivalence of distance education and traditional face-to-face (F2F) instruction in statistics and biostatistics is mixed. Despite the difficulty in randomization, we minimized intra-instructor variation between F2F and online sections in seven graduate-level biostatistics service courses in a synchronous (live, real time) fashion; that is, for each course taught in a traditional F2F setting, a separate set of students were taught simultaneously via online learning technology, allowing for two-way interaction between instructor and students. Our primary objective was to compare student performance in the two courses that use these two teaching modes. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to test equivalence of modes. The frequentist mixed model approach was also conducted for reference. The results of Bayesian and frequentist methods agree and suggest a difference of less than 1% in average final grades. Finally, we discuss barriers to instruction and learning using the applied online teaching technology.","Hierarchical models,Online learning,Statistics education","STATISTICS,EDUCATION,WINBUGS","Wick, Jo A.@Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Biostat, 3901 Rainbow Blvd, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA::Yeh, Hung-Wen@Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Biostat, 3901 Rainbow Blvd, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA::Gajewski, Byron J.@Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Biostat, 3901 Rainbow Blvd, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA","Wick, Jo A.@University of Kansas Medical Center@University of Kansas::Yeh, Hung-Wen@University of Kansas Medical Center@University of Kansas::Gajewski, Byron J.@University of Kansas Medical Center@University of Kansas",not exist,"no title+Allen, I.

Though useful, these plots confuse students in my introductory statistics classes. A water-filling analogy, however, intuitively conveys the underlying concept. This analogy characterizes a QQ plot as a parametric plot of the water levels in two gradually filling vases. Each vase takes its shape from a probability distribution or sample. If the vases share a common shape, then the water levels match throughout the filling, and the QQ plot traces a diagonal line. An R package qqvases provides an interactive animation of this process and is suitable for classroom use.","Diagnostic,Education,Simulation",BOX,"Stine, Robert A.@Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Dept Stat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Stine, Robert A.@University of Pennsylvania",not exist,"The Power to See: A New Graphical Test of Normality+Aldor-Noiman, Sivan; Brown, Lawrence D.; Buja, Andreas; et al.+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+NOV 2013::OPENING THE BOX OF A BOXPLOT+BENJAMINI, Y+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+NOV 1988::What Is Statistics?+Brown, Emery N.; Kass, Robert E.+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 2009::Effects of Kinesio Taping versus McConnell taping for patellofemoral pain syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis+Chang, W; Chen, F; Lee, C.+Evid Based Complement Alternat Med.+2015::Mere Renovation is Too Little Too Late: We Need to Rethink our Undergraduate Curriculum from the Ground Up+Cobb, George+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+OCT 2 2015::Violin plots: A box plot-density trace synergism+Hintze, JL; Nelson, RD+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1998::ON KOLMOGOROV-SMIRNOV TEST FOR NORMALITY WITH MEAN AND VARIANCE UNKNOWN+LILLIEFORS, HW+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1967::no title+Stine, R.; Foster, D.+Statistics for Business: Decision Making and Analysis+2014::no title+Verzani, J.+Using R for introductory statistics+2005"
The Current Landscape of Teaching Analytics to Business Students at Institutions of Higher Education: Who is Teaching What?,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2016.1277160,MAY 2017,23,1,"Business analytics continues to become increasingly important in business and therefore in business education. We surveyed faculty who teach statistics or whose institutions offer statistics to business students and conducted web searches of business analytics and data science programs that are offered by these faculties associated with schools of business. The intent of the survey and web searches was to gain insight on the current landscape of business analytics and how it may work synergistically with data science at institutions of higher education, as well as inform the role that statistics education plays in the era of big data. The study presents an analysis of subject areas (Statistics, Operations Research, Management Information Systems, Data Analytics, and Soft Skills) covered in courses offered by institutions with undergraduate degrees in business analytics or data science influencing statistics taught to business students. Given the notable contribution of statistics to the study of business analytics and data science and the importance of knowledge and skills acquired in statistics-based courses not only for students pursuing a major or minor in the discipline, but also for all business majors entering the current data-centric business environment, we present findings about who is teaching what in business statistics education.","Analytics,Big data,Statistics education","UNDERGRADUATE CURRICULUM,STATISTICS","Phelps, Amy L.@Duquesne Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, 600 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15282 USA::Szabat, Kathryn A.@La Salle Univ, Dept Business Syst & Analyt, Philadelphia, PA 19141 USA","Phelps, Amy L.@Duquesne University::Szabat, Kathryn A.@Unknow",not exist,"Big Data, Analytics, and Data Science Undergraduate Degree Program+Aasheim, C.; Williams, S.; Rutner, P.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Gardiner, A</span>.+DEC SCI I M TAMP FLO+2014::Strategic Plan+no author+Statistical Science+2008::A Data Science Course for Undergraduates: Thinking With Data+Baumer, Ben+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+OCT 2 2015::Teaching Statistics at Google-Scale+Chamandy, Nicholas; Muralidharan, Omkar; Wager, Stefan+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+OCT 2 2015::Mere Renovation is Too Little Too Late: We Need to Rethink our Undergraduate Curriculum from the Ground Up+Cobb, George+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+OCT 2 2015::no title+Colby, A.; Ehrlich, T.; Sullivan, W.+Rethinking undergraduate business education: Liberal learning for the profession+2011::no title+Davenport, T.

An Empirical Comparison of Multiple Imputation Methods for Categorical Data,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2016.1277158,MAY 2017,41,1,"Multiple imputation is a common approach for dealing with missing values in statistical databases. The imputer fills in missing values with draws from predictive models estimated from the observed data, resulting in multiple, completed versions of the database. Researchers have developed a variety of default routines to implement multiple imputation; however, there has been limited research comparing the performance of these methods, particularly for categorical data. We use simulation studies to compare repeated sampling properties of three default multiple imputation methods for categorical data, including chained equations using generalized linear models, chained equations using classification and regression trees, and a fully Bayesian joint distribution based on Dirichlet process mixture models. We base the simulations on categorical data from the American Community Survey. In the circumstances of this study, the results suggest that default chained equations approaches based on generalized linear models are dominated by the default regression tree and Bayesian mixture model approaches. They also suggest competing advantages for the regression tree and Bayesian mixture model approaches, making both reasonable default engines for multiple imputation of categorical data.

Closed-Form Estimators for the Gamma Distribution Derived From Likelihood Equations,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2016.1209129,MAY 2017,13,1,"It is well-known that maximum likelihood (ML) estimators of the two parameters in a gamma distribution do not have closed forms. This poses difficulties in some applications such as real-time signal processing using low-grade processors. The gamma distribution is a special case of a generalized gamma distribution. Surprisingly, two out of the three likelihood equations of the generalized gamma distribution can be used as estimating equations for the gamma distribution, based on which simple closed-form estimators for the two gamma parameters are available. Intuitively, performance of the new estimators based on likelihood equations should be close to the ML estimators. The study consolidates this conjecture by establishing the asymptotic behaviors of the new estimators. In addition, the closed-forms enable bias-corrections to these estimators. The bias-correction significantly improves the small-sample performance.","Asymptotic efficiency,Bias-correction,Estimating equations,Generalized gamma distribution",GENERALIZED GAMMA,"Ye, Zhi-Sheng@Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Singapore 117576, Singapore::Chen, Nan@Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Singapore 117576, Singapore","Ye, Zhi-Sheng@National University of Singapore::Chen, Nan@National University of Singapore",not exist,"no title+no author+HDB MATH FUNCTIONS F+1972::Estimation of Field Reliability Based on Aggregate Lifetime Data+Chen, P.; Ye, Z. -S.+Technometrics+2016::changepoint: An R Package for Changepoint Analysis+Killick, Rebecca; Eckley, Idris A.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL SOFTWARE+JUN 2014::Normal-based methods for a gamma distribution: Prediction and tolerance intervals and stress-strength reliability+Krishnamoorthy, K.; Mathew, Thomas; Mukherjee, Shubhabrata+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 2008::INFERENCE IN THE GENERALIZED GAMMA AND LOG GAMMA DISTRIBUTIONS+LAWLESS, JF+TECHNOMETRICS+1980::no title+Meeker, W.

A Note on High-Dimensional Linear Regression With Interactions,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2016.1264311,2017,31,1,"The problem of interaction selection in high-dimensional data analysis has recently received much attention. This note aims to address and clarify several fundamental issues in interaction selection for linear regression models, especially when the input dimension p is much larger than the sample size n. We first discuss how to give a formal definition of ""importance"" for main and interaction effects. Then we focus on two-stage methods, which are computationally attractive for high-dimensional data analysis but thus far have been regarded as heuristic. We revisit the counterexample of Turlach and provide new insight to justify two-stage methods from the theoretical perspective. In the end, we suggest new strategies for interaction selection under the marginality principle and provide some simulation results.","Heredity condition,Hierarchical structure,Interaction effects,Linear model,Marginality principle","GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION,HIERARCHICAL VARIABLE SELECTION,LEAST ANGLE REGRESSION,DESIGNED EXPERIMENTS,GENE INTERACTIONS,ORACLE PROPERTIES,MODEL SELECTION,LASSO,PROPERTY","Hao, Ning@Univ Arizona, Dept Math, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA::Zhang, Hao Helen@Univ Arizona, Dept Math, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Hao, Ning@University of Arizona::Zhang, Hao Helen@University of Arizona",not exist,"A LASSO FOR HIERARCHICAL INTERACTIONS+Bien, Jacob; Taylor, Jonathan; Tibshirani, Robert+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2013::Statistics for High-Dimensional Data: Methods, Theory and Applications+Buehlmann, Peter; van de Geer, Sara+STATISTICS FOR HIGH-DIMENSIONAL DATA: METHODS, THEORY AND APPLICATIONS+2011::Extended Bayesian information criteria for model selection with large model spaces+Chen, Jiahua; Chen, Zehua+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 2008::Bayesian variable selection with related predictors+Chipman, H+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+MAR 1996::A Bayesian variable-selection approach for analyzing designed experiments with complex aliasing+Chipman, H; Hamada, M; Wu, CFJ+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1997::Variable Selection With the Strong Heredity Constraint and Its Oracle Property+Choi, Nam Hee; Li, William; Zhu, Ji+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2010::Detecting gene-gene interactions that underlie human diseases+Cordell, Heather J.+NATURE REVIEWS GENETICS+JUN 2009::Least angle regression+Efron, B; Hastie, T; Johnstone, I; et al.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2004::Two-stage two-locus models in genome-wide association+Evans, David M.; Marchini, Jonathan; Morris, Andrew P.; et al.+PLOS GENETICS+SEP 2006::A SELECTIVE OVERVIEW OF VARIABLE SELECTION IN HIGH DIMENSIONAL FEATURE SPACE+Fan, Jianqing; Lv, Jinchi+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 2010::Variable selection via nonconcave penalized likelihood and its oracle properties+Fan, JQ; Li, RZ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2001::iFORM/eQTL: an ultrahigh-dimensional platform for inferring the global genetic architecture of gene transcripts+Gosik, Kirk; Kong, Lan; Chinchilli, Vernon M.; et al.+BRIEFINGS IN BIOINFORMATICS+MAR 2017::ANALYSIS OF DESIGNED EXPERIMENTS WITH COMPLEX ALIASING+HAMADA, M; WU, CFJ+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1992::Model Selection for High-Dimensional Quadratic Regression via Regularization+Hao, Ning; Feng, Yang; Zhang, Hao Helen+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+2018::Interaction Screening for Ultrahigh-Dimensional Data+Hao, Ning; Zhang, Hao Helen+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUL 3 2014::Increasing the power of identifying gene x gene interactions in genome-wide association studies+Kooperberg, Charles; LeBlanc, Michael+GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY+APR 2008::Genes, environment, health, and disease: Facing up to complexity+Manolio, Teri A.; Collins, Francis S.+HUMAN HEREDITY+2007::What is a statistical model?+McCullagh, P+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+OCT 2002::no title+McCullagh, P.; Nelder, J.+Generalized Linear Models+1989::REFORMULATION OF LINEAR-MODELS+NELDER, JA+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1977::THE STATISTICS OF LINEAR-MODELS - BACK TO BASICS+NELDER, JA+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+DEC 1994::A PROPERTY OF WELL-FORMULATED POLYNOMIAL REGRESSION-MODELS+PEIXOTO, JL+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+FEB 1990::HIERARCHICAL VARIABLE SELECTION IN POLYNOMIAL REGRESSION-MODELS+PEIXOTO, JL+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+NOV 1987::Regression shrinkage and selection via the Lasso+Tibshirani, R+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1996::Least angle regression - Discussion+Turlach, BA+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2004::Screen and Clean: A Tool for Identifying Interactions in Genome-Wide Association Studies+Wu, Jing; Devlin, Bernie; Ringquist, Steven; et al.+GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY+APR 2010::Genome-wide association analysis by lasso penalized logistic regression+Wu, Tong Tong; Chen, Yi Fang; Hastie, Trevor; et al.+BIOINFORMATICS+MAR 15 2009::STRUCTURED VARIABLE SELECTION AND ESTIMATION+Yuan, Ming; Joseph, V.

A Simple Analysis of the Exact Probability Matching Prior in the Location-Scale Model,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2016.1255662,2017,17,0,"It has long been asserted that in univariate location-scale models, when concerned with inference for either the location or scale parameter, the use of the inverse of the scale parameter as a Bayesian prior yields posterior credible sets that have exactly the correct frequentist confidence set interpretation. This claim dates to at least Peers, and has subsequently been noted by various authors, with varying degrees of justification. We present a simple, direct demonstration of the exact matching property of the posterior credible sets derived under use of this prior in the univariate location-scale model. This is done by establishing an equivalence between the conditional frequentist and posterior densities of the pivotal quantities on which conditional frequentist inferences are based.","Conditional inference,Location-scale,Matching prior,Objective Bayes,p*","LIKELIHOOD,PARAMETERS","DiCiccio, Thomas J.@Cornell Univ, Dept Social Stat, Ithaca, NY USA::Kuffner, Todd A.@Washington Univ, Dept Math, St Louis, MO 63130 USA::Young, G.

What Do Interpolated Nonparametric Confidence Intervals for Population Quantiles Guarantee?,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2016.1226952,2017,9,1,"The interval between two prespecified order statistics of a sample provides a distribution-free confidence interval for a population quantile. However, due to discreteness, only a small set of exact coverage probabilities is available. Interpolated confidence intervals are designed to expand the set of available coverage probabilities. However, we show here that the infimum of the coverage probability for an interpolated confidence interval is either the coverage probability for the inner interval or the coverage probability obtained by removing the more likely of the two extreme subintervals from the outer interval. Thus, without additional assumptions, interpolated intervals do not expand the set of available guaranteed coverage probabilities.","Distribution-free,Order statistics,Quantiles",ORDER-STATISTICS,"Frey, Jesse@Villanova Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Villanova, PA 19085 USA::Zhang, Yimin@Villanova Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Villanova, PA 19085 USA","Frey, Jesse@Villanova University::Zhang, Yimin@Villanova University",not exist,"INTERPOLATED NONPARAMETRIC PREDICTION INTERVALS AND CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS+BERAN, R; HALL, P+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1993::SMOOTHED EMPIRICAL LIKELIHOOD CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS FOR QUANTILES+CHEN, SX; HALL, P+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+SEP 1993::CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS BASED ON INTERPOLATED ORDER-STATISTICS+HETTMANSPERGER, TP; SHEATHER, SJ+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+MAR 1986::Calibrated interpolated confidence intervals for population quantiles+Ho, YHS; Lee, SMS+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 2005::no title+Krishnamoorthy, K.; Mathew, T.+Statistical Tolerance Regions: Theory, Applications, and Computation+2009::NOTE ON INTERPOLATED ORDER-STATISTICS+NYBLOM, J+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+MAY 27 1992::Multi-sample inference for simple-tree alternatives with ranked-set samples+Ozturk, O; Wolfe, DA; Alexandridis, R+AUSTRALIAN &amp; NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+SEP 2004::Ranked-set sample nonparametric quantile confidence intervals+Ozturk, O; Deshpande, JV+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+MAR 1 2006::Improved nonparametric tolerance intervals based on interpolated and extrapolated order statistics+Young, Derek S.; Mathew, Thomas+JOURNAL OF NONPARAMETRIC STATISTICS+2014"
A Coefficient of Determination for Generalized Linear Models,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2016.1256839,2017,14,1,"The coefficient of determination, a.k.a. R-2, is well-defined in linear regression models, and measures the proportion of variation in the dependent variable explained by the predictors included in the model. To extend it for generalized linear models, we use the variance function to define the total variation of the dependent variable, as well as the remaining variation of the dependent variable after modeling the predictive effects of the independent variables. Unlike other definitions that demand complete specification of the likelihood function, our definition of R-2 only needs to know the mean and variance functions, so applicable to more general quasi-models. It is consistent with the classical measure of uncertainty using variance, and reduces to the classical definition of the coefficient of determination when linear regression models are considered.","Exponential family distribution,Quasi-model,R-2,Variance function",,"Zhang, Dabao@Purdue Univ, Dept Stat, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Zhang, Dabao@Purdue University@Purdue University System","Zhang, Dabao@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0629-8672","no title+Agresti, A.+An Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis+1996::NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::An R-squared measure of goodness of fit for some common nonlinear regression models+Cameron, AC; Windmeijer, FAG+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+APR 1997::no title+Cox, DR; Snell, EJ.+The Analysis of Binary Data+1989::EXPONENTIAL DISPERSION MODELS+JORGENSEN, B+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1987::ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks+Krizhevsky, A.; Sutskever, I.; Hinton, G.E.+Communications of the ACM+June 2017::no title+Maddala, G.S.+Limited-Dependent and Qualitative Variables in Econometrics+1983::R2 MEASURES BASED ON WALD AND LIKELIHOOD RATIO JOINT SIGNIFICANCE TESTS+MAGEE, L+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 1990::NATURAL EXPONENTIAL-FAMILIES WITH QUADRATIC VARIANCE FUNCTIONS - STATISTICAL-THEORY+MORRIS, CN+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1983::NATURAL EXPONENTIAL-FAMILIES WITH QUADRATIC VARIANCE FUNCTIONS+MORRIS, CN+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1982::A NOTE ON A GENERAL DEFINITION OF THE COEFFICIENT OF DETERMINATION+NAGELKERKE, NJD+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1991::ESTIMATING DIMENSION OF A MODEL+SCHWARZ, G+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1978::A MATHEMATICAL THEORY OF COMMUNICATION+SHANNON, CE+BELL SYSTEM TECHNICAL JOURNAL+1948::Locality Sensitive Deep Learning for Detection and Classification of Nuclei in Routine Colon Cancer Histology Images+Sirinukunwattana, Korsuk; Raza, Shan E.

These templates are spreadsheet files that allow easy and intuitive learning and the implementation of practical examples concerning descriptive statistics, random variables, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing. Although they are designed to be used with Excel, they can also be employed with other free spreadsheet programs (changing some particular formulas). Moreover, we exploit some possibilities of the ActiveX controls of the Excel DeveloperMenu to perform interactive Gaussian density charts. Finally, it is important to note that they can be often embedded in a web page, so it is not necessary to employ Excel software for their use. These templates have been designed as a useful tool to teach basic statistics and to carry out data analysis even when the students are not familiar with Excel. Additionally, they can be used as a complement to other analytical software packages. They aim to assist students in learning statistics, within an intuitive working environment.

Teaching Decision Theory Proof Strategies Using a Crowdsourcing Problem,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2016.1264316,2017,10,0,"Teaching how to derive minimax decision rules can be challenging because of the lack of examples that are simple enough to be used in the classroom. Motivated by this challenge, we provide a new example that illustrates the use of standard techniques in the derivation of optimal decision rules under the Bayes and minimax approaches. We discuss how to predict the value of an unknown quantity,theta.epsilon {0, 1}, given the opinions of n experts. An important example of such crowdsourcing problem occurs in modern cosmology, where theta indicates whether a given galaxy is merging or not, and Y-1,..., Y-n are the opinions from n astronomers regarding theta We use the obtained prediction rules to discuss advantages and disadvantages of the Bayes andminimax approaches to decision theory. The material presented here is intended to be taught to first- year graduate students.","Bayes decision,Crowdsourcing problem,Minimax decision",,"Esteves, Luis Gustavo@Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Stat, Sao Paulo, Brazil::Izbicki, Rafael@Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Stat, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil::Stern, Rafael Bassi@Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Stat, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil","Esteves, Luis Gustavo@Universidade de Sao Paulo::Izbicki, Rafael@Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos::Stern, Rafael Bassi@Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos",not exist,"no title+Casella, G.; Berger, R.

A Comparison of Correlation Structure Selection Penalties for Generalized Estimating Equations,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2016.1200490,2017,41,1,"Correlated data are commonly analyzed using models constructed using population-averaged generalized estimating equations (GEEs). The specification of a population-averaged GEE model includes selection of a structure describing the correlation of repeated measures. Accurate specification of this structure can improve efficiency, whereas the finite-sample estimation of nuisance correlation parameters can inflate the variances of regression parameter estimates. Therefore, correlation structure selection criteria should penalize, or account for, correlation parameter estimation. In this article, we compare recently proposed penalties in terms of their impacts on correlation structure selection and regression parameter estimation, and give practical considerations for data analysts.

Mean-Minimum Exact Confidence Intervals,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2016.1256838,2017,18,0,"This article introduces mean-minimum (MM) exact confidence intervals for a binomial probability.

For example, an MM 95[ 93]% interval has mean coverage at least 95% and minimum coverage at least 93%. In the conventional sense, such an interval can be viewed as an exact 93% interval that hasmean coverage at least 95% or it can be viewed as an approximate 95% interval that has minimum coverage at least 93%. Graphical and numerical summaries of coverage and expected length suggest that the Blaker based MM exact interval is an attractive alternative to, even an improvement over, commonly recommended approximate and exact intervals, including the Agresti-Coull approximate interval, the Clopper-Pearson (CP) exact interval, and the more recently recommended CP-, Blaker-, and Sterne-based mean-coverageadjusted approximate intervals.","Agresti-Coull interval,Approximate vs. exact confidence intervals,Binomial distribution,Blaker, Sterne, and Clopper-Pearson exact intervals,Mean-coverage-adjusted interval,Test inversion,Valid p-values","BINOMIAL PROPORTION,DISCRETE-DISTRIBUTIONS,INFERENCE","Lang, Joseph B.@Univ Iowa, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA","Lang, Joseph B.@University of Iowa",not exist,"Approximate is better than ""exact"" for interval estimation of binomial proportions+Agresti, A; Coull, BA+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1998::On small-sample confidence intervals for parameters in discrete distributions+Agresti, A; Min, YY+BIOMETRICS+SEP 2001::no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical Data Analysis+2002::Nonconservative exact small-sample inference for discrete data+Agresti, Alan; Gottard, Anna+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+AUG 15 2007::Confidence curves and improved exact confidence intervals for discrete distributions+Blaker, H+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+DEC 2000::BINOMIAL CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS+BLYTH, CR; STILL, HA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1983::Interval estimation for a binomial proportion - Comment - Rejoinder+Brown, LD; Cai, TT; DasGupta, A; et al.+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 2001::REFINING BINOMIAL CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS+CASELLA, G+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+JUN 1986::no title+Casella, G.; Berger, R.+Statistical Inference+2002::The use of confidence or fiducial limits illustrated in the case of the binomial.+Clopper, CJ; Pearson, ES+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1934::CONFIDENCE INTERVALS FOR A PROPORTION+CROW, EL+BIOMETRIKA+1956::Confidence intervals for the binomial parameter: some new considerations+Reiczigel, J+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+FEB 28 2003::A Coverage Probability Approach to Finding an Optimal Binomial Confidence Procedure+Schilling, Mark F.; Doi, Jimmy A.+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 2014::SOME REMARKS ON CONFIDENCE OR FIDUCIAL LIMITS+STERNE, TE+BIOMETRIKA+1954::The cost of using exact confidence intervals for a binomial proportion+Thulin, Mans+ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+2014::Coverage-adjusted Confidence Intervals for a Binomial Proportion+Thulin, Mans+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+JUN 2014::Exact confidence coefficients of confidence intervals for a binomial proportion+Wang, Hsiuying+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 2007::Probable inference, the law of succession, and statistical inference+Wilson, EB+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1927"

A Note on the Inverse Birthday Problem With Applications,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2016.1255657,2017,23,0,"The classical birthday problem considers the probability that at least two people in a group of size N share the same birthday. The inverse birthday problem considers the estimation of the size N of a group given the number of different birthdays in the group. In practice, this problem is analogous to estimating the size of a population from occurrence data only. The inverse problem can be solved via two simple approaches including the method of moments for a multinominal model and the maximum likelihood estimate of a Poisson model, which we present in this study. We investigate properties of both methods and show that they can yield asymptotically equivalent Wald-type interval estimators. Moreover, we show that these methods estimate a lower bound for the population size when birth rates are nonhomogenous or individuals in the population are aggregated. A simulation study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the point estimates arising from the two approaches and to compare the performance of seven interval estimators, including likelihood ratio and log-transformation methods. We illustrate the utility of these methods by estimating: (1) the abundance of tree species over a 50-hectare forest plot, (2) the number of Chlamydia infections when only the number of different birthdays of the patients is known, and (3) the number of rainy days when the number of rainy weeks is known.

Sufficiency Revisited: Rethinking Statistical Algorithms in the Big Data Era,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2016.1255659,2017,36,0,"The big data era demands new statistical analysis paradigms, since traditional methods often break down when datasets are too large to fit on a single desktop computer. Divide and Recombine (D&R) is becoming a popular approach for big data analysis, where results are combined over subanalyses performed in separate data subsets. In this article, we consider situations where unit record data cannot be made available by data custodians due to privacy concerns, and explore the concept of statistical sufficiency and summary statistics for model fitting. The resulting approach represents a type of D&R strategy, which we refer to as summary statistics D & R; as opposed to the standard approach, which we refer to as horizontal D&R. We demonstrate the concept via an extended Gamma-Poisson model, where summary statistics are extracted from different databases and incorporated directly into the fitting algorithm without having to combine unit record data. By exploiting the natural hierarchy of data, our approach has major benefits in terms of privacy protection. Incorporating the proposed modelling framework into data extraction tools such as TableBuilder by the Australian Bureau of Statistics allows for potential analysis at a finer geographical level, which we illustrate with a multilevel analysis of the Australian unemployment data.

Statistical Engineering: An Idea Whose Time Has Come?,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2016.1247015,2017,44,0,"Several authors, including the American Statistical Association (ASA) guidelines for undergraduate statistics education (American Statistical Association Undergraduate Guidelines Workgroup), have noted the challenges facing statisticians when attacking large, complex, and unstructured problems, as opposed to well-defined textbook problems. Clearly, the standard paradigm of selecting the one correct statistical method for such problems is not sufficient; a new paradigm is needed. Statistical engineering has been proposed as a discipline that can provide a viable paradigm to attack such problems, used in conjunction with sound statistical science. Of course, to develop as a true discipline, statistical engineering must be clearly defined and articulated. Further, a well-developed underlying theory is needed, one that would prove helpful in addressing such large, complex, and unstructured problems. The purpose of this expository article is to more clearly articulate the current state of statistical engineering, and make a case for why it merits further study by the profession as a means of addressing such problems. We conclude with a ""call to action"".","Complex problems,Unstructured problems,Statistical education,Integration","UNDERGRADUATE CURRICULUM,SPECIAL-ISSUE,SIX-SIGMA,THINKING,STUDENTS,COURSES,FUTURE","Hoerl, Roger W.@Union Coll, Schenectady, NY 12308 USA::Snee, Ronald D.@Snee Associates LLC, Newark, DE USA","Hoerl, Roger W.@Union College::Snee, Ronald D.@Unknow",not exist,"no title+no author+2014 Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Programs in Statistical Science+2014::Editorial for Statistical Engineering Special Issue+Anderson-Cook, Christine M.; Lu, Lu+QUALITY ENGINEERING+2012::A structured problem-solving course for graduate students: Exposing students to Six Sigma as part of their university training+Anderson-Cook, CM; Patterson, A; Hoerl, R+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+APR 2005::Proper Blending: The Right Mix Between Statistical Engineering and Applied Statistics+[Anonymous].+Quality Progress+May 2011::A Data Science Course for Undergraduates: Thinking With Data+Baumer, Ben+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+OCT 2 2015::PRICING OF OPTIONS AND CORPORATE LIABILITIES+BLACK, F; SCHOLES, M+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+1973::ON THE EXPERIMENTAL ATTAINMENT OF OPTIMUM CONDITIONS+BOX, GEP; WILSON, KB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1951::Modern Interdisciplinary University Statistics Education+no author+COMM APPL THEOR STAT+1994::Teaching Statistics at Google-Scale+Chamandy, Nicholas; Muralidharan, Omkar; Wager, Stefan+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+OCT 2 2015::Mere Renovation is Too Little Too Late: We Need to Rethink our Undergraduate Curriculum from the Ground Up+Cobb, George+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+OCT 2 2015::Big Data and the Missing Links+De Veaux, Richard D.; Hoerl, Roger W.; Snee, Ronald D.+STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND DATA MINING+DEC 2016::no title+DiBenedetto, A.+Addressing Large, Complex, Unstructured Problems+2014::no title+Dibenedetto, A.; Hoerl, R.; Snee, D.+Quality Progress+2014::Statistical Engineering+Eisenhart, C.+Technical News Bulletin+1950::Fostering Conceptual Understanding in Mathematical Statistics+Green, Jennifer L.; Blankenship, Erin E.+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+OCT 2 2015::A Framework for Infusing Authentic Data Experiences Within Statistics Courses+Grimshaw, Scott D.+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+OCT 2 2015::A Cognitive Interpretation of Data Analysis+Grolemund, Garrett; Wickham, Hadley+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+AUG 2014::Data Science in Statistics Curricula: Preparing Students to ""Think with Data""+Hardin, J.; Hoerl, R.; Horton, Nicholas J.; et al.+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+OCT 2 2015::Complaint Department: Statistical Engineering Extends Sphere of Influence+Hare, L.

Strategies for Success: Early-Stage Collaborating Biostatistics Faculty in an Academic Health Center,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2016.1277157,2017,31,0,"Collaborative biostatistics faculty (CBF) are increasingly valued by academic health centers (AHCs) for their role in increasingsuccess rates of grants and publications, and educating medical students and clinical researchers. Some AHCs have a biostatistics department that consists of only biostatisticians focused on methodological research, collaborative research, and education. Others may have a biostatistics unit within an interdisciplinary department, or statisticians recruited into clinical departments. Within each model, there is also variability in environment, influenced by the chair's background, research focus of colleagues, type of students taught, funding sources, and whether the department is in a medical school or school of public health. CBF appointments may be tenure track or nontenure, and expectations for promotion may vary greatly depending on the type of department, track, and the AHC. In this article, the authors identify strategies for developing early-stage CBFs in four domains: (1)Influenceof department/environment, (2) Skills to develop, (3) Ways to increase productivity, and (4) Ways to document accomplishments. Graduating students and postdoctoral fellows should consider the first domain when choosing a faculty position. Early-stage CBFs will benefit by understanding the requirements of their environment early in their appointment and by modifying the provided progression grid with their chair and mentoring team as needed. Following this personalized grid will increase the chances of a satisfying career with appropriate recognition for academic accomplishments.","Career choice,Career progression grid,Career satisfaction,Collaborative biostatistics faculty,Faculty promotion,Leadership as statistician","NETWORKING,EDUCATION,GUIDE","Spratt, Heidi@Univ Texas Med Branch, Dept Prevent Med & Community Hlth, Galveston, TX 77555 USA::Fox, Erin E.@Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Dept Surg, Med Sch, Houston, TX 77030 USA@Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Dept Internal Med, Med Sch, Div Clin & Translat Sci, Houston, TX 77030 USA::Shara, Nawar@MedStar Res Hlth Inst, Dept Biostat & Bioinformat, Hyattsville, MD USA@Georgetown Howard Univ, Biostat Epidemiol & Res Design Core, Clin & Translat Sci Ctr, Washington, DC USA@Georgetown Univ, Div Endocrinol, Washington, DC USA::Mazumdar, Madhu@Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Populat Hlth Sci Policy, New York, NY 10029 USA@Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Med, New York, NY 10029 USA@Tisch Canc Inst, Dept Populat Hlth Sci Policy, Inst Healthcare Delivery Sci, New York, NY USA@Tisch Canc Inst, Dept Med, New York, NY USA","Spratt, Heidi@University of Texas System@University of Texas Medical Branch Galveston::Fox, Erin E.@University of Texas System@University of Texas Health Science Center Houston::Shara, Nawar@Georgetown University::Mazumdar, Madhu@Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai",not exist,"Intensive short courses in biostatistics for fellows and physicians+Ambrosius, WT; Manatunga, AK+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+SEP 30 2002::no title+[Anonymous].+Biostatistics Methodology Training for Clinical Trials in Imaging+2014::no title+[Anonymous].+METH CANC BIOST WORK+2015::Career development for early career academics: Benefits of networking and the role of professional societies+Ansmann, Lena; Flickinger, Tabor E.; Barello, Serena; et al.+PATIENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING+OCT 2014::Are Biostatistics Students Prepared to Succeed in the Era of Interdisciplinary Science?

Coherent Hypothesis Testing,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2016.1237893,2017,25,0,"Multiple hypothesis testing, an important quantitative tool to report the results of scientific inquiries, frequently leads to contradictory conclusions. For instance, in an analysis of variance (ANOVA) setting, the same dataset can lead one to reject the equality of two means, say (1) = (2), but at the same time to not reject the hypothesis that mu(1) = mu(2) = 0. These two conclusions violate the coherence principle introduced by Gabriel in 1969, and lead to results that are difficult to communicate, and, many times, embarrassing for practitioners of statistical methods. Although this situation is common in the daily life of statisticians, it is usually not discussed in courses of statistics. In this work, we enrich the teaching and discussion of this important topic by investigating through a few examples whether several standard test procedures are coherent or not. We also discuss the relationship between coherent tests and measures of support. Finally, we show how a Bayesian decision-theoretical framework can be used to build coherent tests. These approaches to coherence enlighten when such property is appealing in multiple testing and provide means of obtaining it.","Bayesian tests,Coherence,Loss functions,Measures of support,Simultaneous hypothesis testing",,"Fossaluza, Victor@Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Stat, Rua Matao,1010 Cidade Univ, BR-05508020 Sao Paulo, Brazil::Izbicki, Rafael@Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Stat, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil::da Silva, Gustavo Miranda@Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Stat, Rua Matao,1010 Cidade Univ, BR-05508020 Sao Paulo, Brazil::Esteves, Luis Gustavo@Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Stat, Rua Matao,1010 Cidade Univ, BR-05508020 Sao Paulo, Brazil","Fossaluza, Victor@Universidade de Sao Paulo::Izbicki, Rafael@Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos::da Silva, Gustavo Miranda@Universidade de Sao Paulo::Esteves, Luis Gustavo@Universidade de Sao Paulo",not exist,"Self-Consistent Confidence Sets and Tests of Composite Hypotheses Applicable to Restricted Parameters+Bickel, D.

Resolving a Multi-Million Dollar Contract Dispute With a Latin Square,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2016.1256231,2017,8,0,"The City of New York negotiated a dispute over the performance of new garbage trucks purchased from a vehicle manufacturer. The dispute concerned the fulfillment of a specification in the purchase contract that the trucks load a minimum full-load of 12.5 tons of household refuse. On behalf of the City, but in cooperation with the manufacturer, the City's Department of Sanitation and consulting statisticians tested fulfillment of the contract specification, employing a Latin Square design for routing trucks. We present the classical analysis using a linear model and analysis of variance. We also show how fixed, mixed, and random effect models are useful in analyzing the results of the test. Finally, we take a Bayesian perspective to demonstrate how the information from the data overcomes the difference between the prior densities of the city and the manufacturer for the load capacities of the trucks to result in much closer posterior densities. This procedure might prove useful in similar negotiations.

This article discussesmentoring strategies for undergraduate and graduate students through internships as well as for postdoctoral research associates and junior staff. Topics addressed include project selection, progress, and outcome; intellectual and social activities that complement the student internship experience; key skills/knowledge not typically obtained in academic training; and the impact of such internships on students' careers. Experiences and strategies from a number of successful mentorships are presented. Feedback from former mentees obtained via a questionnaire is incorporated.

Mentoring Faculty Women in Statistics: Exploring Challenges and Opportunities for Leadership Development,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2016.1255658,2017,44,0,"The problems for faculty women in statistics (FWIS) in the United States are complex and call for programs that aim to develop inclusive leadership competencies among both FWIS and facultymen in statistics (FMIS) regardless of whether they currently hold, or aspire to, administrative positions. Data indicate that, among faculty in doctorate-granting departments of statistics and biostatistics, there is a disparity between genders in numbers of role models or exemplars. Yet we note that there have been some innovative national initiatives over the years inmentoring, networking, or leadership that have been instrumental in advancing FWIS. Given current understandings of the role of implicit bias in sustaining a differential status for FWIS, this discussion emphasizes a new approach as a way to further advance FWIS: one that involves the development of inclusive leadership among both men and women toward promoting inclusive faculty cultures in statistics.","Diversity,Executive education,Inclusive leadership,Lifelong learning,Professional climate",,"Golbeck, Amanda L.@Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Fay W Boozman Coll Publ Hlth, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA","Golbeck, Amanda L.@University of Arkansas Medical Sciences@University of Arkansas System",not exist,"no title+no author+About This Webcast on Leadership Development+2016::no title+no author+AMS-ASA-IMS-MAA-SIAM Data Committee, Annual Survey of the Mathematical Sciences+2016::Effective Presentations for Statisticians at JSM 2013+no author+Amstat News+2013::no title+no author+Member Initiatives for 2016+2016::no title+no author+WOM STAT DAT SCI C+2016::no title+no author+PRES PAP+2016::Leadership in Statistics+Bowman, D.+FINAL PROGRAM+2016::Scientific Course Strengthens Students' Communication Skills+Buchanich, J.M.+Amstat News+2012::Negotiating in Statistical Careers+Buckingham, J.; Puha, A.; Roberson, P.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Wang, J.L</span>.+Joint Statistical Meetings Invited Panel+2014::no title+no author+Mentoring+2016::The Value of Professional Champions and Mentors in an Academic Environment+Ensor, K.+Leadership and Women in Statistics+2016::Where Are the Women in the JSM Registration Guide+Golbeck, A.

Bridging the Gap: A Generalized Stochastic Process for Count Data,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2016.1234976,2017,21,4,"The Bernoulli and Poisson processes are two popular discrete count processes; however, both rely on strict assumptions. We instead propose a generalized homogenous count process (which we name the ConwayMaxwell- Poisson or COM-Poisson process) that not only includes the Bernoulli and Poisson processes as special cases, but also serves as a flexible mechanism to describe count processes that approximate data with over-or under-dispersion. We introduce the process and an associated generalized waiting time distribution with several real-data applications to illustrate its flexibility for a variety of data structures. We consider model estimation under different scenarios of data availability, and assess performance through simulated and real datasets. This new generalized process will enable analysts to better model count processes where data dispersion exists in a more accommodating and flexible manner.","Bernoulli process,Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (COM-Poisson) distribution,Count process,Dispersion,Poisson process,Waitingtime",MODEL,"Zhu, Li@CAC Fund, Shanghai, Peoples R China@Georgetown Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Washington, DC USA::Sellers, Kimberly F.@Georgetown Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Washington, DC USA@US Census Bur, Ctr Stat Res & Methodol, Washington, DC 20223 USA::Morris, Darcy Steeg@US Census Bur, Ctr Stat Res & Methodol, Washington, DC 20223 USA::Shmueli, Galit@Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Inst Serv Sci, Hsinchu, Taiwan","Zhu, Li@Georgetown University::Sellers, Kimberly F.@Georgetown University::Morris, Darcy Steeg@Unknow::Shmueli, Galit@National Tsing Hua University","Shmueli, Galit@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0820-0301","A class of weighted Poisson processes+Balakrishnan, N.; Kozubowski, Tomasz J.+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+OCT 15 2008::NEGATIVE BINOMIAL PROCESSES+BARNDORF.O; YEO, GF+JOURNAL OF APPLIED PROBABILITY+1969::TREND ANALYSIS - BINARY-VALUED AND POINT CASES+BRILLINGER, DR+STOCHASTIC HYDROLOGY AND HYDRAULICS+SEP 1995::no title+Burnham,, K.

Point Estimates of Test Sensitivity and Specificity from Sample Means and Variances,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2016.1239589,2017,15,0,"In a wide variety of biomedical and clinical research studies, sample statistics from diagnostic marker measurements are presented as a means of distinguishing between two populations, such as with and without disease. Intuitively, a larger difference between themean values of a marker for the two populations, and a smaller spread of values within each population, should lead to more reliable classification rules based on this marker. We formalize this intuitive notion by deriving practical, new, closed-form expressions for the sensitivity and specificity of three different discriminant tests defined in terms of the sample means and standard deviations of diagnosticmarkermeasurements. The three discriminant tests evaluated are based, respectively, on the Euclidean distance and theMahalanobis distance between means, and a likelihood ratio analysis. Expressions for the effects of measurement error are also presented. Our final expressions assume that the diagnostic markers follow independent normal distributions for the two populations, although it will be clear that other known distributions may be similarly analyzed. We then discuss applications drawn from the medical literature, although the formalism is clearly not restricted to that application.","Diagnostic markers,Discriminant tests,Test characteristics",,"Spencer, Richard G.@NIH, Magnet Resonance Imaging & Spect Sect, Natl Inst Aging, Baltimore, MD USA::Cortese, Benjamin D.@Syracuse Univ, Dept Math, Syracuse, NY USA::Lukas, Vanessa A.@NIH, Magnet Resonance Imaging & Spect Sect, Natl Inst Aging, Baltimore, MD USA::Pleshko, Nancy@Temple Univ, Dept Bioengn, Tissue Imaging & Spect Lab, Philadelphia, PA USA","Spencer, Richard G.@National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA@NIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)::Cortese, Benjamin D.@Syracuse University::Lukas, Vanessa A.@National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA@NIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)::Pleshko, Nancy@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@University of Pennsylvania@Temple University",not exist,"Approximate is better than ""exact"" for interval estimation of binomial proportions+Agresti, A; Coull, BA+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1998::The Mahalanobis distance+De Maesschalck, R; Jouan-Rimbaud, D; Massart, DL+CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS+JAN 4 2000::Estimation of the Youden index and its associated cutoff point+Fluss, R; Faraggi, D; Reiser, B+BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL+AUG 2005::RECEIVER OPERATOR CHARACTERISTIC (ROC) CURVES AND NONNORMAL DATA - AN EMPIRICAL-STUDY+GODDARD, MJ; HINBERG, I+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+MAR 1990::no title+Hastie, T; Tibshirani, R; Friedman, J.+The Elements of Statistical Learning+2009::Nonparametric methods for evaluating diagnostic tests+Hsieh, FS; Turnbull, BW+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 1996::no title+Johnson, R.A.; Wichern, D.W.+Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis+2007::Classification of degraded cartilage through multiparametric MRI analysis+Lin, Ping-Chang; Reiter, David A.; Spencer, Richard G.+JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE+NOV 2009::Multivariate analysis of cartilage degradation using the support vector machine algorithm+Lin, Ping-Chang; Irrechukwu, Onyi; Roque, Remy; et al.+MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE+JUN 2012::Two-sided confidence intervals for the single proportion: Comparison of seven methods+Newcombe, RG+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+APR 30 1998::THE W TEST FOR NORMALITY+ROYSTON, JP+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+1982::Phosphorus as an early marker of morbidity and mortality in type 2 chronic kidney disease diabetic patients+Silva, Ana Paula; Fragoso, Andre; Pinho, Ana; et al.+JOURNAL OF DIABETES AND ITS COMPLICATIONS+JUL-AUG 2013::How Do Statistical Differences in Matrix-sensitive Magnetic Resonance Outcomes Translate Into Clinical Assignment Rules?+Spencer, Richard G.; Pleshko, Nancy+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF ORTHOPAEDIC SURGEONS+JUL 2013::Global DNA methylation levels in girls with and without a family history of breast cancer+Wu, Hui-Chen; John, Esther M.; Ferris, Jennifer S.; et al.+EPIGENETICS+JAN 2011::INDEX FOR RATING DIAGNOSTIC TESTS+YOUDEN, WJ+CANCER+1950"

"Weighing Evidence ""Steampunk"" Style via the Meta-Analyser",AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2016.1165735,NOV 2016,31,0,"The funnel plot is a graphical visualization of summary data estimates from a meta-analysis, and is a useful tool for detecting departures from the standard modeling assumptions. Although perhaps not widely,appreciated, a simple extension of the funnel plot can help to facilitate an intuitive interpretation of the mathematics underlying a meta-analysis at a more fundamental level, by equating it to determining the center of mass of a physical system. We used this analogy to explain the concepts of weighing evidence and of biased evidence to a young audience at the Cambridge Science Festival, without recourse to precise definitions or statistical formulas and with a little help from Sherlock Holmes! Following on from the science fair, we have developed an interactive web-application (named the Meta-Analyser) to bring these ideas to a wider audience. We envisage that our application will be a useful tool for researchers when interpreting their data. First, to facilitate a simple understanding of fixed and random effects modeling approaches; second, to assess the importance of outliers; and third, to show the impact of adjusting for small study bias. This final aim is realized by introducing a novel graphical interpretation of the well-known method of Egger regression.","Bias adjustment,Egger regression,Funnel plot,Meta-analysis","RANDOM-EFFECTS METAANALYSIS,PUBLICATION BIAS,CONTROLLED-TRIALS,HETEROGENEITY","Bowden, Jack@Univ Bristol, MRC Integrat Epidemiol Unit, Bristol BS8 1TH, Avon, England::Jackson, Chris@Univ Cambridge, MRC Biostat Unit, Cambridge, England","Bowden, Jack@University of Bristol::Jackson, Chris@MRC Biostatistics Unit@University of Cambridge",not exist,"Meta-analysis inside and outside particle physics: two traditions that should converge?+Baker, Rose D.; Jackson, Dan+RESEARCH SYNTHESIS METHODS+JUN 2013::no title+Beatty, M.+Principles of Engineering Mechanics, Volume 2: Dynamics: The Analysis of Motion+2005::Heterogeneity and study size in random-effects meta-analysis+Bowater, Russell J.; Escarela, Gabriel+JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS+JAN 1 2013::Quantifying, displaying and accounting for heterogeneity in the meta-analysis of RCTs using standard and generalised Q statistics+Bowden, Jack; Tierney, Jayne F.; Copas, Andrew J.; et al.+BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY+APR 7 2011::Mendelian randomization analysis of case-control data using structural mean models+Bowden, Jack; Vansteelandt, Stijn+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+MAR 15 2011::Modelling multiple sources of dissemination bias in meta-analysis+Bowden, Jack; Jackson, Dan; Thompson, Simon G.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+MAR-APR 2010::GRAPHICAL PERCEPTION - THEORY, EXPERIMENTATION, AND APPLICATION TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF GRAPHICAL METHODS+CLEVELAND, WS; MCGILL, R+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1984::METAANALYSIS IN CLINICAL-TRIALS+DERSIMONIAN, R; LAIRD, N+CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS+SEP 1986::Trim and fill: A simple funnel-plot-based method of testing and adjusting for publication bias in meta-analysis+Duval, S; Tweedie, R+BIOMETRICS+JUN 2000::Single Dose Oral Aspirin for Acute Pain+Edwards, J.

Assessing Equality of Means Using the Overlap of Range-Preserving Confidence Intervals,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2016.1200487,NOV 2016,41,1,"Hypothesis testing, procedures where equality of means is assessed at a prespecified level based on the (non-)overlap of confidence intervals are discussed. Assessing statistical significance via the (non-)overlap of two confidence intervals with an appropriate confidence level provides a simple and effective way of visually understanding statistical results. This article extends previous approaches by considering range preserving confidence intervals where the values in such intervals are in the allowable range of the paranieter of interest. To obtain reliable procedures, appropriate effective degrees of freedom are suggested by considering the Welch-Satterthwaite equation for both independent two-sample and paired-sample cases. The proposed procedures also allow users to express results in terms of commonly used scale-free effect sizes, which are highly useful for interpreting parameters of interest. Simulation results suggest that the proposed procedures may be robust to unequal or small sample sizes, nonnormal distributions, heterogeneous variances, and various degrees of correlation. A real-life application from a study in cognitive psychology illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed procedures.","Effect size,Two-sample problem,Visualization,Welch-Satterthwaite equation","BEHRENS-FISHER PROBLEM,MULTIPLE COMPARISONS,DIFFERENCE,INFERENCE,TESTS,POWER","Noguchi, Kimihiro@Western Washington Univ, Dept Math, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA::Marmolejo-Ramos, Fernando@Stockholms Univ, Dept Psychol, Stockholm, Sweden","Noguchi, Kimihiro@Western Washington University::Marmolejo-Ramos, Fernando@Stockholm University","Marmolejo-Ramos, Fernando@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4680-1287","Confidence intervals for dependent data: Equating non-overlap with statistical significance+Afshartous, David; Preston, Richard A.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+OCT 1 2010::TYPE-I ERROR RATES FOR WELCH TEST AND JAMES 2ND-ORDER TEST UNDER NONNORMALITY AND INEQUALITY OF VARIANCE WHEN THERE ARE 2 GROUPS+ALGINA, J; OSHIMA, TC; LIN, WY+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL STATISTICS+FAL 1994::GRAPHICAL DISPLAY OF MEANS+ANDREWS, HP; SNEE, RD; SARNER, MH+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+1980::John W.

How the Maximal Evidence of P-Values Against Point Null Hypotheses Depends on Sample Size,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2016.1209128,NOV 2016,31,3,"Minimum Bayes factors are commonly used to transform two-sided p-values to lower bounds on the posterior probability of the null hypothesis. Several proposals exist in the literature, but none of them depends on the sample size. However, the evidence of a p-value against a point null hypothesis is known to depend on the sample size. In this article, we consider p-values in the linear model and propose new minimum Bayes factors that depend on sample size and converge to existing bounds as the sample size goes to infinity. It turns out that the maximal evidence of an exact two-sided p-value increases with decreasing sample size. The effect of adjusting minimum Bayes factors for sample size is shown in two applications.","Evidence,F-Test,Minimum Bayes factor,p-value,Sample size,t-Test","BAYESIAN MODEL SELECTION,TEST STATISTICS,G-PRIORS,FOUNDATIONS,PROPOSAL","Held, Leonhard@Univ Zurich, Dept Biostat Epidemiol, Biostat & Prevent Inst, Hirschengraben 84, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland::Ott, Manuela@Univ Zurich, Dept Biostat Epidemiol, Biostat & Prevent Inst, Hirschengraben 84, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland","Held, Leonhard@University of Zurich::Ott, Manuela@University of Zurich","Held, Leonhard@E-8159-2010","Towards Evidence-Based Medical Statistics. 1.: The P value Fallacy+[Anonymous].+Annals of Internal Medicine+1999::Towards Evidence-based Medical Statistics. 2.: The Bayes Factor+[Anonymous].+Annals of Internal Medicine+1999::Reverse-Bayes Analysis of Two Common Misinterpretations of Significance Tests+[Anonymous].+Clinical Trials+2013::Null Misinterpretation in Statistical Testing and its Impact on Health Risk Assessment+[Anonymous].+Preventive Medicine+2011::Revised Standards for Statistical Evidence+[Anonymous].+Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences+2013::Properties of Bayes Factors Based on Test Statistics+[Anonymous].+Scandinavian Journal of Statistics+2008::Rejection odds and rejection ratios: A proposal for statistical practice in testing hypotheses+Bayarri, M.

Through data-based modeling, we show that the current tournament format is not very effective in determining the true best team. Specifically, by considering a variety of alternate formats, we find that certain formats that exclude all but a handful of teams substantially outperform the current format in determining the true best team. We also find that among formats that involve all ten teams, a format in which the top two seeds each receive two byes is relatively effective. We show that our conclusions are robust to several key modeling choices. We also investigate the effectiveness of the tie-breaking scheme used by the Big East Conference, finding. hat it is little better than random and may even favor weaker teams.","Cohort seeding,Reseeding,Simulation,Tie-breakers","KNOCKOUT TOURNAMENTS,FOOTBALL","Abdul-Chani, Christopher@Villanova Univ, Dept Math Sci, Villanova, PA 19085 USA::Frey, Jesse@Villanova Univ, Dept Math Sci, Villanova, PA 19085 USA","Abdul-Chani, Christopher@Villanova University::Frey, Jesse@Villanova University",not exist,"A comparison of potential playoff systems for NCAA I-A football+Annis, DH; Wu, SS+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 2006::A CLASS OF DISTRIBUTIONS WHICH INCLUDES THE NORMAL ONES+AZZALINI, A+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+1985::Anomalies in Tournament Design: The Madness of March Madness+Baumann, R.; Matheson, V.

Understanding the Ensemble Kalman Filter,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2016.1141709,NOV 2016,44,8,"The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is a computational technique for approximate inference in state-space models. In typical applications, the state vectors are large spatial fields that are observed sequentially over time. The EnKF approximates the Kalman filter by representing the distribution of the state with an ensemble of draws from that distribution. The ensemble members are updated based on newly available data by shifting instead of reweighting, which allows the EnKF to avoid the degeneracy problems of reweighting-based algorithms. Taken together, the ensemble representation and shifting-based updates make the EnKF computationally feasible even for extremely high-dimensional state spaces. The EnKF is successfully used in data-assimilation applications with tens of millions of dimensions. While it implicitly assumes a linear Gaussian state-space model, it has also turned out to be remarkably robust to deviations from these assumptions in many applications. Despite its successes, the EnKF is largely unknown in the statistics community. We aim to change that with the present article, and to entice more statisticians to work on this topic.","Bayesian inference,Forecasting,Kalman smoother,Sequential Monte Carlo,State-space models","GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,DATA ASSIMILATION,PARTICLE FILTERS,SEQUENTIAL STATE,SMOOTHER","Katzfuss, Matthias@Texas A&M Univ, Dept Stat, 3143 TAMU, College Stn, TX 78843 USA::Stroud, Jonathan R.@George Washington Univ, Dept Stat, Washington, DC 20052 USA::Wikle, Christopher K.@Univ Missouri, Dept Stat, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Katzfuss, Matthias@Texas A&M University System@Texas A&M University College Station::Stroud, Jonathan R.@George Washington University::Wikle, Christopher K.@University of Missouri Columbia@University of Missouri System",not exist,"NONLINEAR BAYESIAN ESTIMATION USING GAUSSIAN SUM APPROXIMATIONS+ALSPACH, DL; SORENSON, HW+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1972::A Sequential Ensemble Kalman Filter for Atmospheric Data Assimilation+Anderson, J.L.+Monthly Weather Review+2001::THE DATA ASSIMILATION RESEARCH TESTBED A Community Facility+Anderson, Jeffrey; Hoar, Tim; Raeder, Kevin; et al.+BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY+SEP 2009::Ensemble Kalman Filters for Large Geophysical Applications ADAPTIVE ALGORITHMS FOR IMPROVING ENSEMBLE FILTER PERFORMANCE+Anderson, Jeffrey L.+IEEE CONTROL SYSTEMS MAGAZINE+JUN 2009::Exploring the need for localization in ensemble data assimilation using a hierarchical ensemble filter+Anderson, Jeffrey L.+PHYSICA D-NONLINEAR PHENOMENA+JUN 2007::An adaptive covariance inflation error correction algorithm for ensemble filters+Anderson, Jeffrey L.+TELLUS SERIES A-DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY+MAR 2007::An ensemble adjustment Kalman filter for data assimilation+Anderson, JL+MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW+2001::A Monte Carlo implementation of the nonlinear filtering problem to produce ensemble assimilations and forecasts+Anderson, JL; Anderson, SL+MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW+DEC 1999::Toward a nonlinear ensemble filter for high-dimensional systems+Bengtsson, T; Snyder, C; Nychka, D+JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES+DEC 24 2003::Adaptive sampling with the ensemble transform Kalman filter.

Bias Introduced by Rounding in Multiple Imputation for Ordered Categorical Variables,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2016.1200486,NOV 2016,18,0,"Multivariate normality is frequently assumed when multiple imputation is applied for missing data. When data are ordered categorical, imputing missing data using the fully normal imputation results in implausible values falling outside of the categorical values. Naive rounding has been suggested to round the imputed values to their categorical neighbors for further analysis. Previous studies showed that, for binary data, the rounded values can result in biased mean estimation when the population distribution is asymmetric. However, it has been conjectured that as the number of categories increases, the bias will decrease. To investigate this conjecture, the present study derives the formulas for the biases of the mean and standard deviation for ordered categorical variables with naive rounding. Results show that both the biases of the mean and standard deviation decrease as the number of categories increases from 3 to 9. This study also finds that although symmetric population distributions lead to unbiased means of the rounded Values, the standard deviations may still be largely biased. A simulation studyfurther shows that the biases due to naive rounding can result in substantially low coverage rates for the population mean parameter.","Missing completely at random,Nonresponse,Ordinal variable",FULLY CONDITIONAL SPECIFICATION,"Xia, Yan@Florida State Univ, Coll Educ, Dept Educ Psychol & Learning Syst, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA::Yang, Yanyun@Florida State Univ, Coll Educ, Dept Educ Psychol & Learning Syst, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Xia, Yan@State University System of Florida@Florida State University::Yang, Yanyun@State University System of Florida@Florida State University",not exist,"Rounding after multiple imputation with non-binary categorical covariates+Ake, CF.+ANN M SAS US GROUP I+2005::Rounding Strategies for Multiply Imputed Binary Data+Demirtas, Hakan+BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL+AUG 2009::no title+Enders, C.

How Robust Are Multirater Interrater Reliability Indices to Changes in Frequency Distribution?,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2016.1141708,NOV 2016,23,3,"Interrater reliability studies are used in a diverse set of fields. Often, these investigations involve three or more raters, and thus, require the use of indices such as Fleiss's kappa, Conger's kappa, or Krippendorff's alpha. Through two motivating examples-one theoretical and one from practice-this article exposes limitations of these indices when the units to be rated are not well-distributed across the rating categories. Then, using a Monte Carlo simulation and information visualizations, we argue for the use of two alternative indices, the Brennan-Prediger coefficient and Gwet's AC2, because the agreement levels reported by these indices are more robust to variation in the distribution of units that raters encounter. The article concludes by exploring the complex, interwoven relationship between the number of levels in a rating instrument, the agreement level present among raters, and the distribution of units that are to be scored.

Computation of Two- and Three-Dimensional Confidence Regions With the Likelihood Ratio,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2016.1182946,NOV 2016,13,0,"The asymptotic results pertaining to the distribution of the log-likelihood ratio allow for the creation of a confidence region, which is a general extension of the confidence interval. Two-and three-dimensional regions can be displayed visually to describe the plausible region of the parameters of interest simultaneously. While most advanced statistical textbooks on inference discuss these asymptotic confidence regions, there is no exploration of how to numerically compute these regions for graphical purposes. This article demonstrates the application of a simple trigonometric transformation to compute two-and three-dimensional confidence regions; we transform the Cartesian coordinates of the parameters to create what we call the radial profile log-likelihood. The method is applicable to any distribution with a defined likelihood function, so it is not limited to specific data distributions or model paradigms. We describe the method along with the algorithm, follow with an example of our method, and end with an examination of computation time.

Statistics of Primes (and Probably Twin Primes) Satisfy Taylor's Law from Ecology,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2016.1173591,NOV 2016,15,2,"Taylor's law, which originated in ecology, states that, in sets of measurements of population density, the sample variance is approximately proportional to a power of the sample mean. Taylor's law has been verified for many species ranging from bacterial to human. Here, we show that the variance V(x) and the mean M(x) of the primes not exceeding a real number x obey Taylor's law asymptotically for large x. Specifically, V(x) similar to (1/3)(M(x))(2) as x -> infinity. This apparently new fact about primes shows that Taylor's law may arise in the absence of biological processes, and that patterns discovered in biological data can suggest novel questions in numbertheory. If the Hardy-Littlewood twin primes conjecture is true, then the identical Taylor's law holds also for twin primes. Taylor's law holds in both instances because the primes (and the twin primes, given the conjecture) not exceeding x are asymptotically uniformly distributed on the integers in [2,x]. Hence, asymptotically M(x) similar to x/2, V(x) similar to x(2)/12. Higher-order moments of the primes (twin primes) not exceeding x satisfy a generalized Taylor's law. The 11,078,937 primes and 813,371 twin primes not exceeding 2 x 10(8) illustrate these results.","Generalized Taylor's law,Power law,Prime number theorem,Twin prime conjecture,Uniform distribution,Variance function",,"Cohen, Joel E.@Rockefeller Univ, New York, NY 10065 USA@Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10065 USA@Columbia Univ, Dept Stat, New York, NY USA@Univ Chicago, Dept Stat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Cohen, Joel E.@Columbia University@University of Chicago@Rockefeller University",not exist,"Statistical problems in estimating populations of Japanese beetle larvae+Bliss, CI+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY+1941::no title+Bui, H.

We envision that through the results in this article, a better appreciation of the subtleties involved in the modeling and analysis of recurrent events data will ensue, since the HPP is arguably one of the simplest among recurrent event models. In addition, the use of the theorem of total probability, Bayes'theorem, the iterated rules of expectation, variance and covariance, and the renewal equation could be illustrative when teaching distribution theory, mathematical statistics, and stochastic processes at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.

Case Study in Evaluating Time Series Prediction Models Using the Relative Mean Absolute Error,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2016.1148631,AUG 2016,20,1,"Statistical prediction models inform decision-making processes in many real-world settings. Prior to using predictions in practice, one must rigorously test and validate candidate models to ensure that the proposed predictions have sufficient accuracy to be used in practice. In this article, we present a framework for evaluating time series predictions, which emphasizes computational simplicity and an intuitive interpretation using the relative mean absolute error metric. For a single time series, this metric enables comparisons of candidate model predictions against naive reference models, a method that can provide useful and standardized performance benchmarks. Additionally, in applications with multiple time series, this framework facilitates comparisons of one or more models' predictive performance across different sets of data. We illustrate the use of this metric with a case study comparing predictions of dengue hemorrhagic fever incidence in two provinces of Thailand. This example demonstrates the utility and interpretability of the relative mean absolute error metric in practice, and underscores the practical advantages of using relative performance metrics when evaluating predictions.","Accuracy,Forecasting,Infectious disease,Prediction,Time series","DENGUE,LIKELIHOOD,OUTBREAKS,FORECAST","Reich, Nicholas G.@Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biostat & Epidemiol, Amherst, MA 01003 USA::Lessler, Justin@Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biostat & Epidemiol, Amherst, MA 01003 USA::Sakrejda, Krzysztof@Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biostat & Epidemiol, Amherst, MA 01003 USA::Lauer, Stephen A.@Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biostat & Epidemiol, Amherst, MA 01003 USA::Iamsirithaworn, Sopon@Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biostat & Epidemiol, Amherst, MA 01003 USA::Cummings, Derek A.

A Unified Approach to Authorship Attribution and Verification,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2016.1148630,AUG 2016,55,0,"In authorship attribution, one assigns texts from an unknown author to either one of two or more candidate authors by comparing the disputed texts with texts known to have been written by the candidate authors. In authorship verification, one decides whether a text or a set of texts could have been written by a given author. These two problems are usually treated separately. By assuming an open-set classification framework for the attribution problem, contemplating the possibility that none of the candidate authors is the unknown author, the verification problem becomes a special case of attribution problem. Here both problems are posed as a formal Bayesian multinomial model selection problem and are given a closed-form solution, tailored for categorical data, naturally incorporating text length and dependence in the analysis, and coping well with settings with a small number of training texts. The approach to authorship verification is illustrated by exploring whether a court ruling sentence could have been written by the judge that signs it, and the approach to authorship attribution is illustrated by revisiting the authorship attribution of the Federalist papers and through a small simulation study.","Bayesian methods,Model selection,Multinomial distribution,Stylometry","FEDERALIST-PAPERS,TEXT CATEGORIZATION,LITERARY-STYLE,CLASSIFICATION,MESSAGES,DELTA","Puig, Xavier@Tech Univ Catalonia, Dept Stat, Barcelona 08028, Spain::Font, Marti@Unknow::Ginebra, Josep@Unknow","Puig, Xavier@Polytechnic University of Catalonia::Font, Marti@Unknow::Ginebra, Josep@Unknow",not exist,"Applying authorship analysis to extremist-group web forum messages+Abbasi, A; Chen, HC+IEEE INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS+SEP-OCT 2005::Computer-Based Authorship Attribution Without Lexical Measures+[Anonymous].+Computers and the Humanities+2001::All the Way Through: Testing for Authorship in Different Frequency Strata+[Anonymous].+Literary and Linguistic Computing+2007::Multivariate Analysis and the Study of Style Variation+[Anonymous].+Literary and Linguistic Computing+2003::The Evolution of Stylometry in Humanities Scholarship+[Anonymous].+Literary and Linguistic Computing+1998::Interpreting Burrows's Delta: Geometric and Probabilistic Foundations+Argamon, Shlomo+LITERARY AND LINGUISTIC COMPUTING+JUN 2008::Who wrote the 15th book of oz?

Data-Driven Confidence Interval Estimation Incorporating Prior Information with an Adjustment for Skewed Data,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2016.1141707,AUG 2016,21,4,"Bayesian credible interval (CI) estimation is a statistical procedure that has been well addressed in both the theoretical and applied literature. Parametric assumptions regarding baseline data distributions are critical for the implementation of this method. We provide a nonparametric technique for incorporating prior information into the equal-tailed (ET) and highest posterior density (HPD) CI estimators in the Bayesian manner. We propose to use a data-driven likelihood function, replacing the parametric likelihood function to create a distribution-free posterior. Higher order asymptotic propositions are derived to show the efficiency and consistency of the proposed method. We demonstrate that the proposed approach may correct confidence regions with respect to skewness of the data distribution. An extensive Monte Carlo (MC) study confirms the proposed method significantly outperforms the classical CI estimation in a frequentist context. A real data example related to a study of myocardial infarction illustrates the excellent applicability of the proposed technique.

We propose and develop a calibrated Bayes approach for comparing these competing models that has the desired property of giving equal support to the three models when no genetic association is present. The naive approach with noncalibrated priors is shown to produce misleading Bayes factors. The method is fully developed with simulation studies, real data analyses, and an efficient algorithm based on an asymptotic approximation. An illuminating connection to the Kullback-Leibler divergence is also established. The proposed calibrated prior can serve as a reference prior for a genetic association study or as a common baseline prior for comparing Bayes analyses of different datasets.","Asymptotics,Bayes factor,Calibrated Bayes,Kullback-Leibler,Statistical Genetics","STATISTICAL-METHODS,P-VALUES,SNPS","Liao, J.

This article discusses the origin and evolution of the contest, describes its benefits in increased engagement and improved attendance, provides information and tips for faculty who might want to conduct a joke contest, and includes some example jokes.","Stimulating originality,Student engagement,Student motivation",,"Wierman, John C.@Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Appl Math & Stat, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA","Wierman, John C.@Johns Hopkins University",not exist,
Teaching and Learning Data Visualization: Ideas and Assignments,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2015.1123651,AUG 2016,30,1,"This article discusses how to make statistical graphics a more prominent element of the undergraduate statistics curricula. The focus is on several different types of assignments that exemplify how to incorporate graphics into a course in a pedagogically meaningful way. These assignments include having students deconstruct and reconstruct plots, copy masterful graphs, create one-minute visual revelations, convert tables into ""pictures,"" and develop interactive visualizations, for example, with the virtual earth as a plotting canvas. In addition to describing the goals and details of each assignment, we also discuss the broader topic of graphics and key concepts that we think warrant inclusion in the statistics curricula. We advocate that more attention needs to be paid to this fundamental field of statistics at all levels, from introductory undergraduate through graduate level courses. With the rapid rise of tools to visualize data, for example, Google trends, GapMinder, ManyEyes, and Tableau, and the increased use of graphics in the media, understanding the principles of good statistical graphics, and having the ability to create informative visualizations is an ever more important aspect of statistics education. Supplementary materials containing code and data for the assignments are available online.","Computing,Data analysis,Interactive visualization,Statistical graphics,Teaching","GRAPHS,TABLES","Nolan, Deborah@Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Stat, 367 Evans Hall MC 3860, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA::Perrett, Jamis@Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Stat, 367 Evans Hall MC 3860, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Nolan, Deborah@University of California System@University of California Berkeley::Perrett, Jamis@University of California System@University of California Berkeley",not exist,"Investigating a hierarchy of students' interpretations of graphs+Aoyama, K.+International Electronic Journal of Mathematics Education+2007::no title+no author+2014 Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Programs in Statistical Science+2014::no title+BAKKER A+P 7 INT C TEACH STAT+2006::Statistical Thinking in a Technological Environment+Ben-Zvi, D.; Friedlander, A.+Research on the Role of Technology in Teaching and learning statistics+1997::no title+no author+The World Factbook+2015::no title+Chihara, LM.; Hesterberg, T.

I revisit Kolmogorov's axiomatic view of the mean, which unifies all these concepts of mean, among others. A population counterpart of the notion of regular mean, along with notions of regular variance and standard deviation will also be discussed here as unifying concepts.

The Number of MCMC Draws Needed to Compute Bayesian Credible Bounds,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2016.1158738,AUG 2016,41,1,"In the past 20 years, there has been a staggering increase in the use of Bayesian statistical inference, based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, to estimate model parameters and other quantities of interest. This trend exists in virtually all areas of engineering and science. In a typical application, researchers will report estimates of parametric functions (e.g., quantiles, probabilities, or predictions of future outcomes) and corresponding intervals from MCMC methods. One difficulty with the use of inferential methods based on Monte Carlo (MC) is that reported results may be inaccurate due to MC error. MC error, however, can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the number of MC draws. Most users of MCMC methods seem to use indirect diagnostics, trial-and-error, or guess-work to decide how long to run a MCMC algorithm and accuracy of MCMC output results is rarely reported. Unless careful analysis is done, reported numerical results may contain digits that are completely meaningless. In this article, we describe an algorithm to provide direct guidance on the number of MCMC draws needed to achieve a desired amount of precision (i.e., a specified number of accurate significant digits) for Bayesian credible interval endpoints.","Monte Carlo error,Nonparametric quantile estimation,Precision","CHAIN MONTE-CARLO,MARKOV-CHAINS,BLOCK BOOTSTRAP,SIMULATION,CONFIDENCE,VARIANCE,OUTPUT,ERROR","Liu, Jia@Pfizer Inc, Andover, MA 01810 USA::Nordman, Daniel J.@Pfizer Inc, Andover, MA 01810 USA::Meeker, William Q.@Pfizer Inc, Andover, MA 01810 USA","Liu, Jia@Pfizer::Nordman, Daniel J.@Pfizer::Meeker, William Q.@Pfizer",not exist,"HETEROSKEDASTICITY AND AUTOCORRELATION CONSISTENT COVARIANCE-MATRIX ESTIMATION+ANDREWS, DWK+ECONOMETRICA+MAY 1991::Bias-Corrected Nonparametric Spectral Estimation+[Anonymous].+Journal of Time Series Analysis+1995::no title+Athreya, K.B.; Lahiri, S.N.+Measure Theory and Probability Theory+2006::Regenerative block bootstrap for Markov chains+Bertail, Patrice; Clemencon, Stephan+BERNOULLI+AUG 2006::Bayesian Modeling Using the MCMC Procedure+Chen, F.+P SAS GLOB FOR 2008+2009::no title+Dobson,, A.

We also introduce a weighted version of the rootogram that can be applied out of sample orto (weighted) subsets ofthe data, for example, in finite mixture models. An empirical illustration revisiting a well-known dataset from ethology is included, for which a negative binomial hurdle model is employed. Supplementary materials providing two further illustrations are available online: the first, using data from public health, employs a two-component finite mixture of negative binomial models; the second, using data from finance, involves underdispersion.

Explaining the Importance of Variability to Engineering Students,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2015.1064478,MAY 2016,6,0,"One of the main challenges of teaching statistics to engineering students is to convey the importance of being conscious of the presence of variability and of taking it into account when making technical and managerial decisions. Often, technical subjects are explained in an ideal and deterministic environment. This article shows the possibilities of simple electrical circuits-the Wheatstone Bridge among them-to explain to students how to characterize variability, how it is transmitted, and how it affects decisions. Additionally, they can be used to introduce the importance of robustness by showing that taking into account the variability of components allows the design of cheaper products with greater benefits than if one were to simply apply formulas that consider variables as exact values. The results are quite unexpected, and they arouse the interest and motivation of students. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.","Engineering students,Robust product,Teaching,Variability,Wheatstone Bridge",,"Grima, Pere@Univ Politecn Cataluna, BarcelonaTech, Dept Stat & Operat Res, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain::Rodero, Lourdes@Unknow::Tort-Martorell, Xavier@Unknow","Grima, Pere@Polytechnic University of Catalonia::Rodero, Lourdes@Unknow::Tort-Martorell, Xavier@Unknow","Grima, Pere@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1470-1230::Tort-Martorell, Xavier@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1167-6703","TEACHING STATISTICS TO ENGINEERS+BISGAARD, S+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+NOV 1991::Quality quandaries-Is your robust design procedure robust?+Box, G.; Fung, C.

For many other bivariate distributions, the identity that links these two quantities together is not straightforward to formulate. Furthermore, even when this can be done, solving the equation in either direction may be far from trivial. We propose a simple technique that enables students and researchers to compute one of these correlations when the other is specified. Generalizing the normal-based results to abroad range of bivariate distributional setups is potentially useful in graduate level teaching as well as in simulation studies that involve dichotomization and random number generation where the relationships between these correlation types need to be modeled.","Dichotomization,Random number generation,Simulation","POWER POLYNOMIALS,ORDINAL DATA,GENERATION","Demirtas, Hakan@Univ Illinois, Div Epidemiol & Biostat MC923, 1603 West Taylor St, Chicago, IL 60612 USA","Demirtas, Hakan@University of Illinois Chicago Hospital@University of Illinois Chicago@University of Illinois System",not exist,"Simultaneous generation of multivariate mixed data with Poisson and normal marginals+Amatya, Anup; Demirtas, Hakan+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+OCT 13 2015::A method for multivariate ordinal data generation given marginal distributions and correlations+Demirtas, H+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+NOV 2006::A Practical Way for Computing Approximate Lower and Upper Correlation Bounds+Demirtas, Hakan; Hedeker, Donald+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 2011::Computing the Point-biserial Correlation under Any Underlying Continuous Distribution+Demirtas, Hakan; Hedeker, Donald+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+2016::Multiple imputation under power polynomials+Demirtas, Hakan; Hedeker, Donald+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+2008::Concurrent Generation of Ordinal and Normal Data+Demirtas, Hakan; Yavuz, Yasemin+JOURNAL OF BIOPHARMACEUTICAL STATISTICS+JUL 4 2015::SIMULTANEOUS GENERATION OF BINARY AND NORMAL DATA WITH SPECIFIED MARGINAL AND ASSOCIATION STRUCTURES+Demirtas, Hakan; Doganay, Beyza+JOURNAL OF BIOPHARMACEUTICAL STATISTICS+2012::Simulation of massive public health data by power polynomials+Demirtas, Hakan; Hedeker, Donald; Mermelstein, Robin J.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+NOV 30 2012::A method for generating high-dimensional multivariate binary variates+Emrich, J.

A Statistical Approach to Crime Linkage,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2015.1123185,MAY 2016,73,1,"The object of this article is to develop a statistical approach to criminal linkage analysis that discovers and groups crime events that share a common offender and prioritizes suspects for further investigation. Bayes factors are used to describe the strength of evidence that two crimes are linked. Using concepts from agglomerative hierarchical clustering, the Bayes factors for crime pairs are combined to provide similarity measures for comparing two crime series. This facilitates crime series clustering, crime series identification, and suspect prioritization. The ability of our models to make correct linkages and predictions is demonstrated under a variety of real-world scenarios with a large number of solved and unsolved breaking and entering crimes. For example, a naive Bayes model for pairwise case linkage can identify 82% of actual linkages with a 5% false positive rate. For crime series identification, 74%-89% of the additional crimes in a crime series can be identified from a ranked list of 50 incidents.","Bayes factor,Burglary,Clustering,Comparative case analysis,Likelihood ratio,Predictive policing","BEHAVIORAL CASE LINKAGE,SERIAL SEX OFFENDERS,MODUS-OPERANDI,CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS,LOGISTIC-REGRESSION,TEMPORAL PROXIMITY,LINKING,CONSISTENCY,BURGLARIES,SIMILARITY","Porter, Michael D.@Univ Alabama, Informat Syst Stat & Management Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA","Porter, Michael D.@University of Alabama System@University of Alabama Tuscaloosa",not exist,"The use of data mining techniques in operational crime fighting+Adderley, R+INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFORMATICS, PROCEEDINGS+2004::Modus operandi modelling of group offending: A data mining case study+Adderley, R.; Musgrove, P.B.+International Journal of Police Science and Management+2003::no title+ADDERLEY R+P 7 ACM SIGKDD INT C+2001::Pragmatic solutions to offender profiling and behavioural investigative advice+Alison, Laurence; Goodwill, Alasdair; Almond, Louise; et al.+LEGAL AND CRIMINOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY+FEB 2010::An examination of behavioral consistency using individual behaviors or groups of behaviors in serial homicide+Bateman, Alicia L.; Salfati, C.

Analogies for Helping Clinicians and Investigators Better Understand the Principles and Practice of Biostatistics,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2015.1073625,MAY 2016,8,0,"For the interaction between the biostatistician and the clinician or research investigator to be successful, it is important not only for the investigator to be able to explain biological and medical principles in a way that can be understood by the biostatistician, so, too, the biostatistician needs tools to help the investigator understand both the practice of statistics and specific statistical methods. In our practice, we have found it useful to draw analogies between statistical concepts and familiar medical or everyday ideas. These analogies help to stress a point or provide an understanding on the part of the investigator. For example, explaining the reason for using a nonparametric procedure (a general procedure used when the underlying distribution of the data is not known or cannot be assumed) by comparing it to using broad spectrum antibiotics (a general antibiotic used when the specific bacteria causing infection is unknown or cannot be assumed) can be an effective teaching tool. We present a variety of useful (and hopefully amusing) analogies that can be adopted by statisticians to help investigators at all levels of experience better understand principles and practice of statistics.","Consulting,Education,Professional Practice",,"Lesser, Martin L.@Feinstein Inst Med Res, Biostat Unit, Manhasset, NY 11030 USA@Hofstra North Shore LIJ Sch Med, Hempstead, NY USA::Akerman, Meredith B.@Unknow::Kohn, Nina@Unknow","Lesser, Martin L.@Northwell Health@Hofstra University::Akerman, Meredith B.@Unknow::Kohn, Nina@Unknow",not exist,"no title+Dawson, G.

Their simplicity is striking and they should be more broadly used in applications everywhere. Their soundness is due to three statistical properties that these three distributions share as well as the fact that for all of them there exists a simple power reparameterization that symmetrizes the corresponding likelihood function. As a consequence, asymptotic maximum likelihood results are applicable even for samples of size one. Likelihood intervals of the new parameter may be easily transformed back to the original parameter of interest, the mean, by the invariance property of the likelihood function. Practical examples are given to illustrate the proposed inferential procedures.","Likelihood intervals,Profile likelihood,Small sample sizes","CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS,PARAMETER","Diaz-Frances, Eloisa@Ctr Invest Matemat CIMAT, Dept Probabil & Stat, Guanajuato 36240, Mexico","Diaz-Frances, Eloisa@CIMAT - Centro de Investigacion en Matematicas",not exist,"Normal Likelihood Functions+Anscombe, F.

The proposed approach can be regarded as a Bayesian version of the pooled-variance t-statistic and has various appealing properties in practical applications. It relies on data only through the t-statistic and can thus be calculated by using an Excel spreadsheet or a pocket calculator. It avoids several undesirable paradoxes, which may be encountered by the previous Bayesian approach in the literature. Specifically, the proposed approach can be easily taught in an introductory statistics course with an emphasis on Bayesian thinking.

Variations of Q-Q Plots: The Power of Our Eyes!,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2015.1077728,MAY 2016,30,4,"In statistical modeling, we strive to specify models that resemble data collected in studies or observed from processes. Consequently, distributional specification and parameter estimation are central to parametric models. Graphical procedures, such as the quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot, are arguably the most widely used method of distributional assessment, though critics find their interpretation to be overly subjective. Formal goodness of fit tests are available and are quite powerful, but only indicate whether there is a lack of fit, not why there is lack of fit. In this article, we explore the use of the lineup protocol to inject rigor into graphical distributional assessment and compare its power to that of formal distributional tests. We find that lineup tests are considerably more powerful than traditional tests of normality. A further investigation into the design of Q-Q plots shows that de-trended Q-Q plots are more powerful than the standard approach as long as the plot preserves distances in x and y to be the same. While we focus on diagnosing nonnormality, our approach is general and can be directly extended to the assessment of other distributions.","Lineup protocol,Normality test,Quantile-Quantile plot,Statistical graphics,Visual inference","NORMALITY,FIT","Loy, Adam@Lawrence Univ, Dept Math, Appleton, WI 54911 USA::Follett, Lendie@Unknow::Hofmann, Heike@Unknow","Loy, Adam@Lawrence University::Follett, Lendie@Unknow::Hofmann, Heike@Unknow","Loy, Adam@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5780-4611::Hofmann, Heike@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6216-5183","The Power to See: A New Graphical Test of Normality+Aldor-Noiman, Sivan; Brown, Lawrence D.; Buja, Andreas; et al.+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+NOV 2013::no title+no author+Mechanical Turk+2010::A TEST OF GOODNESS OF FIT+ANDERSON, TW; DARLING, DA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1954::no title+Becker, RA; Chambers, JM; Wilks, AR.+The new S language: a programming environment for data analysis and graphics+1988::Statistical inference for exploratory data analysis and model diagnostics+Buja, Andreas; Cook, Dianne; Hofmann, Heike; et al.+PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES+NOV 13 2009::Nonnaivete among Amazon Mechanical Turk workers: Consequences and solutions for behavioral researchers+Chandler, Jesse; Mueller, Pam; Paolacci, Gabriele+BEHAVIOR RESEARCH METHODS+MAR 2014::Graphical perception: Theory, experimentation, and application to the development of graphical methods+Cleveland, W.

One explanation is that viewer attention is driven by the whole bar, rather than only the edge that provides information about an average. This study explored several approaches to correcting this bias. Bar graphs with 95% confidence intervals were used with different levels of contrast to manipulate attention directed to the bar. Viewers showed less bias when the salience of the bar itself was reduced. Response latencies were lowest and bias was eliminated when participants were presented with only a confidence interval and no bar.","Bar graph,Bias,Confidence interval,Graph","CLOSURE,OBJECT,ATTENTION","Pentoney, Christopher S.@Claremont Grad Univ, Dept Psychol, Claremont, CA 91711 USA::Berger, Dale E.@Unknow","Pentoney, Christopher S.@Claremont Graduate School::Berger, Dale E.@Unknow",not exist,"Visual comparisons within and between object parts: evidence for a single-part superiority effect+Barenholtz, E; Feldman, J+VISION RESEARCH+JUL 2003::Error Bars Considered Harmful: Exploring Alternate Encodings for Mean and Error+Correll, Michael; Gleicher, Michael+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS+DEC 2014::THE EFFECT OF CONTOUR CLOSURE ON THE RAPID DISCRIMINATION OF 2-DIMENSIONAL SHAPES+ELDER, J; ZUCKER, S+VISION RESEARCH+MAY 1993::A CLOSED CURVE IS MUCH MORE THAN AN INCOMPLETE ONE - EFFECT OF CLOSURE IN FIGURE GROUND SEGMENTATION+KOVACS, I; JULESZ, B+PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA+AUG 15 1993::The role of closure in defining the ""objects"" of object-based attention+Marino, AC; Scholl, BJ+PERCEPTION &amp; PSYCHOPHYSICS+OCT 2005::Bar graphs depicting averages are perceptually misinterpreted: The within-the-bar bias+Newman, George E.; Scholl, Brian J.+PSYCHONOMIC BULLETIN &amp; REVIEW+AUG 2012::Objects and attention: the state of the art+Scholl, BJ+COGNITION+JUN 2001::What is a visual object?

The p-Value You Can't Buy,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2015.1069760,JAN 2 2016,32,5,"There is growing frustration with the concept of the p-value. Besides having an ambiguous interpretation, the p-value can be made as small as desired by increasing the sample size, n. The p-value is outdated and does not make sense with big data: Everything becomes statistically significant. The root of the problem with the p-value is in the mean comparison. We argue that statistical uncertainty should be measured on the individual, not the group, level. Consequently, standard deviation (SD), not standard error (SE), error bars should be used to graphically present the data on two groups. We introduce a new measure based on the discrimination of individuals/objects from two groups, and call it the D-value. The D-value can be viewed as the n-of-1 p-value because it is computed in the same way as p while letting n equal 1. We show how the D-value is related to discrimination probability and the area above the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The D-value has a clear interpretation as the proportion of patients who get worse after the treatment, and as such facilitates to weigh up the likelihood of events under different scenarios.","Discrimination error,Effect size,ROC curve,Significance testing","EFFECT SIZE,CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS,STATISTICS,DIFFERENCE,MODELS,AREA","Demidenko, Eugene@Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biomed Data Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA@Dartmouth Coll, Dept Math, Hanover, NH 03755 USA","Demidenko, Eugene@Dartmouth College",not exist,"The Reformation+Adler, J.+REFORMATION+May/June 2014::Rescuing US biomedical research from its systemic flaws+Alberts, Bruce; Kirschner, Marc W.; Tilghman, Shirley; et al.+PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA+APR 22 2014::Cellular Heterogeneity: Do Differences Make a Difference?+Altschuler, Steven J.; Wu, Lani F.+CELL+MAY 14 2010::Confidence Intervals for an Effect Size Measure Based on the Mann-Whitney Statistic.

The Central Role of Bayes' Theorem for Joint Estimation of Causal Effects and Propensity Scores,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2015.1111260,JAN 2 2016,32,2,"Although propensity scores have been central to the estimation of causal effects for over 30 years, only recently has the statistical literature begun to consider in detail methods for Bayesian estimation of propensity scores and causal effects. Underlying this recent body of literature on Bayesian propensity score estimation is an implicit discordance between the goal of the propensity score and the use of Bayes' theorem. The propensity score condenses multivariate covariate information into a scalar to allow estimation of causal effects without specifying a model for how each covariate relates to the outcome. Avoiding specification of a detailed model for the outcome response surface is valuable for robust estimation of causal effects, but this strategy is at odds with the use of Bayes' theorem, which presupposes a full probability model for the observed data that adheres to the likelihood principle. The goal of this article is to explicate this fundamental feature of Bayesian estimation of causal effects with propensity scores to provide context for the existing literature and for future work on this important topic.","Bayesian estimation,Causal inference,Model feedback","MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS,INFERENCE,STRATIFICATION,CONFOUNDERS,ADJUSTMENT,REGRESSION","Zigler, Corwin Matthew@Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Bldg 2,4th Floor,655 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Zigler, Corwin Matthew@Harvard University",not exist,"BAYESIAN PROPENSITY SCORE ESTIMATORS: INCORPORATING UNCERTAINTIES IN PROPENSITY SCORES INTO CAUSAL INFERENCE+An, Weihua+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODOLOGY, VOL 40+2010::Rare outcomes, common treatments: Analytic strategies using propensity scores+Braitman, LE; Rosenbaum, PR+ANNALS OF INTERNAL MEDICINE+OCT 15 2002::A note on using the estimated versus the known propensity score to estimate the average treatment effect+Brumback, Babette A.+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+FEB 15 2009::Comparison of logistic regression versus propensity score when the number of events is low and there are multiple confounders+Cepeda, MS; Boston, R; Farrar, JT; et al.+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+AUG 1 2003::Dealing with limited overlap in estimation of average treatment effects+Crump, Richard K.; Hotz, V.

Average Entropy: A New Uncertainty Measure with Application to Image Segmentation,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2015.1089788,JAN 2 2016,15,8,"Various modifications have been suggested in the past to extend Shannon entropy to continuous random variables. This article investigates these modifications, and suggests a new entropy measure with the name of average entropy (AE). AE is more general than Shannon entropy in the sense that its definition encompasses both continuous as well as discrete domains. It is additive, positive and attains zero only when the distribution is uniform. The main characteristic of the suggested measure lies in its consistency behavior. Many properties of AE, including its relationship with Kullback-Leibler information measure, are studied. Precise theorems about the vanishing of the conditional AE for both continuous and discrete distributions are provided. Toward the end, the measure is tested for its effectiveness in image segmentation.","Distribution,Entropy,Image segmentation,Information measurement",,"Kittaneh, Omar A.@Effat Univ, Jeddah 21478, Saudi Arabia::Khan, Mohammad A.

The Advantages of Using Group Means in Estimating the Lorenz Curve and Gini Index From Grouped Data,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2015.1105152,JAN 2 2016,34,1,"A recent article proposed a histogram-based method for estimating the Lorenz curve and Gini index from grouped data that did not use the group means reported by government agencies. When comparing their method to one based on group means, the authors assume a uniform density in each grouping interval, which leads to an overestimate of the overall average income. After reviewing the additional information in the group means, it will be shown that as the number of groups increases, the bounds on the Gini index obtained from the group means become narrower. This is not necessarily true for the histogram method. Two simple interpolation methods using the group means are described and the accuracy of the estimated Gini index they yield and the histogram-based one are compared to the published Gini index for the 1967-2013 period. The average absolute errors of the estimated Gini index obtained from the two methods using group means are noticeably less than that of the histogram-based method.

Evaluating the Validity of Post-Hoc Subgroup Inferences: A Case Study,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2015.1093961,JAN 2 2016,20,0,"In randomized experiments, the random assignment of units to treatment groups justifies many of the widely used traditional analysis methods for evaluating causal effects. Specifying subgroups of units for further examination after observing outcomes, however, may partially nullify any advantages of randomized assignment when data are analyzed naively. Some previous statistical literature has treated all post-hoc subgroup analyses homogeneously as entirely invalid and thus uninterpretable. The extent of the validity of such analyses and the factors that affect the degree of validity remain largely unstudied. Here, we describe a recent pharmaceutical case with First Amendment legal implications, in which post-hoc subgroup analyses played a pivotal and controversial role. Through Monte Carlo simulation, we show that post-hoc results that seem highly significant make dramatic movements toward insignificance after accounting for the subgrouping procedure presumably used. Finally, we propose a novel, randomization-based method that generates valid post-hoc subgroup p-values, provided we know exactly how the subgroups were constructed. If we do not know the exact subgrouping procedure, our method may still place helpful bounds on the significance level of estimated effects. This randomization-based approach allows us to evaluate causal effects in situations where valid evaluations were previously considered impossible.","Causal inference,Fisher randomization test,Multiple comparisons,p-value,Randomization-based inference,Statistical significance","CAUSAL INFERENCE,CLINICAL-TRIALS,STATISTICS","Lee, Joseph J.@Unknow::Rubin, Donald B.@Harvard Univ, Dept Stat, Stat, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Lee, Joseph J.@Unknow::Rubin, Donald B.@Harvard University","Lee, Joseph@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8016-2592","no title+no author+Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis+2013::Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis+[Anonymous].+Cleveland Clinic+2013::Causal Inference Using Potential Outcomes+[Anonymous].+Journal of the American Statistical Association+2005::Comment on Randomization Analysis of Experimental Data: The Fisher Randomization Test+[Anonymous].+Journal of the American Statistical Association+1980::InterMune Announces Phase III Data Demonstrating Survival Benefit of Actimmune in IPF+[Anonymous].+INTERMUNE ANN PHAS 3+2012::Subgroup analysis and other (mis)uses of baseline data in clinical trials+Assmann, SF; Pocock, SJ; Enos, LE; et al.+LANCET+MAR 25 2000::EXACT SIGNIFICANCE LEVELS FOR MULTIPLE BINOMIAL TESTING WITH APPLICATION TO CARCINOGENICITY SCREENS+BROWN, CC; FEARS, TR+BIOMETRICS+1981::no title+Fisher, R.

Using linear prediction techniques for stationary time series, a new test statistic that assesses a null hypothesis of equal means is proposed and investigated. Our test statistic mimics the classical F-type ratio form used with independent data, but substitutes estimated prediction residuals in for the errors. This simple tactic departs from past studies that adjust the quadratic forms in the numerator and denominator in the F ratio for autocorrelation. One of the advantages is that our statistic retains the classical null hypothesis F distribution (now as a limit) with the customary degrees of freedom.

"Misunderstood and Unattributed: Revisiting M. H. Doolittle's Measures of Association, With a Note on Bayes' Theorem",AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2015.1086686,JAN 2 2016,108,1,"In the 1880s, American scholars developed measures of association and chance for cross-classification tables that anticipated the more widely known work of Galton, Pearson, Yule, and Fisher. Three of the measures form the historical backdrop for the earliest known use of a joint probability measure that mirrored Bayes' theorem long before the latter gained general interest among statisticians. The joint probability measure, which served as a foundational step in M. H. Doolittle's development of the first of the two association ratios, has not previously been reviewed in the statistical literature. It was reintroduced as if newly developed in a subfield of experimental psychology more than a century after Doolittle's work was published. It has flourished there, but it has not seen use in other academic venues. The article describes its properties and limitations and proposes that it be disseminated and debated beyond its current narrow application. The article notes that Doolittle's first association ratio can be expressed as another joint probability and that prior treatments in the literature are inconsistent with Doolittle's understanding of its purpose. The article also demonstrates that the equivalent of Cohen's kappa () was developed by Doolittle in 1887, as his second association measure.","Bayes' theorem,Cohen's kappa,Chi-square,Confusion matrix,C.

Strengths and shortcomings of the traditional display are described. A new enhanced qqplot, the self-calibrating qqplot, is introduced and demonstrated on a variety of examplesboth synthetic and real. Real examples include normal qqplots, log-normal plots, half-normal plots for factorial experiments, qqplots for and s in process improvement applications, detection of multivariate outliers, and the comparison of empirical distributions.

Bootstrapping a Universal Pivot When Nuisance Parameters are Estimated,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2015.1086436,JAN 2 2016,9,0,"In complete samples from a continuous cumulative distribution with unknown parameters, it is known that various pivotal functions can be constructed by appealing to the probability integral transform. A pivotal function (or simply pivot) is a function of the data and parameters that has the property that its distribution is free of any unknown parameters. Pivotal functions play a key role in constructing confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. If there are nuisance parameters in addition to a parameter of interest, and consistent estimators of the nuisance parameters are available, then substituting them into the pivot can preserve the pivot property while altering the pivot distribution, or may instead create a function that is approximately a pivot in the sense that its asymptotic distribution is free of unknown parameters. In this latter case, bootstrapping has been shown to be an effective way of estimating its distribution accurately and constructing confidence intervals that have more accurate coverage probability in finite samples than those based on the asymptotic pivot distribution. In this article, one particular pivotal function based on the probability integral transform is considered when nuisance parameters are estimated, and the estimation of its distribution using parametric bootstrapping is examined.

"An Example of an Improvable Rao-Blackwell Improvement, Inefficient Maximum Likelihood Estimator, and Unbiased Generalized Bayes Estimator",AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2015.1100683,JAN 2 2016,12,0,"The Rao-Blackwell theorem offers a procedure for converting a crude unbiased estimator of a parameter into a better one, in fact unique and optimal if the improvement is based on a minimal sufficient statistic that is complete. In contrast, behind every minimal sufficient statistic that is not complete, there is an improvable Rao-Blackwell improvement. This is illustrated via a simple example based on the uniform distribution, in which a rather natural Rao-Blackwell improvement is uniformly improvable. Furthermore, in this example the maximum likelihood estimator is inefficient, and an unbiased generalized Bayes estimator performs exceptionally well. Counterexamples of this sort can be useful didactic tools for explaining the true nature of a methodology and possible consequences when some of the assumptions are violated.","Improper prior,Minimal sufficiency,Uniform distribution,Uniformly minimum-variance unbiased estimator",,"Galili, Tal@Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Stat & Operat Res, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel::Meilijson, Isaac@Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Stat & Operat Res, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Galili, Tal@Tel Aviv University::Meilijson, Isaac@Tel Aviv University","Galili, Tal@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0046-7332","no title+Abramovich, F.; Ritov, Y.+Statistical Theory: A Concise Introduction+2013::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD AND MINIMUM X2 ESTIMATES OF THE LOGISTIC FUNCTION+BERKSON, J+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1955::A NOTE ON BAYES ESTIMATES+BICKEL, PJ; BLACKWEL.D+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1967::CONDITIONAL EXPECTATION AND UNBIASED SEQUENTIAL ESTIMATION+BLACKWELL, D+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1947::Efficiency of a linear combination of the median and the sample mean: The double truncated normal distribution+Damilano, G; Puig, P+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+DEC 2004::no title+Jeffrey, A.; Zwillinger, D.+TABLE INTEGRALS SERI+2007::Completeness, similar regions, and unbiased estimation.

Mere Renovation is Too Little Too Late: We Need to Rethink our Undergraduate Curriculum from the Ground Up,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2015.1093029,OCT 2 2015,127,11,"The last half-dozen years have seen The American Statistician publish well-argued and provocative calls to change our thinking about statistics and how we teach it, among them Brown and Kass, Nolan and Temple-Lang, and Legler etal. Within this past year, the ASA has issued a new and comprehensive set of guidelines for undergraduate programs (ASA, Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Programs in Statistical Science). Accepting (and applauding) all this as background, the current article argues the need to rethink our curriculum from the ground up, and offers five principles and two caveats intended to help us along the path toward a new synthesis. These principles and caveats rest on my sense of three parallel evolutions: the convergence of trends in the roles of mathematics, computation, and context within statistics education. These ongoing changes, together with the articles cited above and the seminal provocation by Leo Breiman call for a deep rethinking of what we teach to undergraduates. In particular, following Brown and Kass, we should put priority on two goals, to make fundamental concepts accessible and to minimize prerequisites to research.[Received December 2014.

Teaching Statistics at Google-Scale,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2015.1089790,OCT 2 2015,19,2,"Modern data and applications pose very different challenges from those of the 1950s or even the 1980s. Students contemplating a career in statistics or data science need to have the tools to tackle problems involving massive, heavy-tailed data, often interacting with live, complex systems. However, despite the deepening connections between engineering and modern data science, we argue that training in classical statistical concepts plays a central role in preparing students to solve Google-scale problems.

The goal of the workshop is to expose students to exciting, modern applied statistical research and practice, with the ultimate aim of interesting them in seeking more training in statistics at the undergraduate and graduate levels. The program is explicitly designed to engage students in the connections between authentic domain problems and the statistical ideas and approaches needed to address these problems, which is an important aspect of statistical thinking that is difficult to teach and sometimes lacking in our methodological courses and programs. Over the past 9years, we ran the workshop six times and a similar program in the sciences two times. We describe the program, summarize feedback from participants, and identify the key features to its success.

We also illustrate the types of challenging projects the students are confronted with via two case studies and relate the skills learned and reinforced in this consulting class model to the skills demanded in the modern statistical work force.

However, 10years after the release of the Guidelines for the Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE) College Report, 2005, and the subsequent movement to stress conceptual understanding and foster active learning in statistics classrooms, the sequence still remains a traditional, lecture-intensive course. In this article, we discuss various instructional approaches, activities, and assessments that can be used to foster active learning and emphasize conceptual understanding while still covering the necessary theoretical content students need to be successful in subsequent statistics or actuarial science courses. In addition, we share student reflections on these course enhancements. The course revision we suggest doesn't require substantial changes in content, so other mathematical statistics instructors can implement these strategies without sacrificing concepts in probability and inference that are fundamental to the needs of their students.

This article discusses the use of design and analysis of experiments (DAE) as a nonterminal second course in statistics for undergraduate statistics majors, minors, and other students seeking exposure to the practice of statistics beyond the introductory course. DAE is a gateway to approaching statistical thinking as data-based problem solving by exposing students to statistical, computational, data, and communication skills in the second course. Given the somewhat antiquated view of design and deemphasis of classical design of experiments topics in the new ASA curriculum guidelines, DAE may seem an odd choice for the second course; however, it exposes students to the breadth of the statistical problem-solving process, explores foundational issues of the discipline, and is accessible to students who have not yet finished their advanced mathematical training. These skills remain essential in the data science era as students must be equipped to understand the potential and peril of found data using the principles of design. While DAE may not be the appropriate second course for all statistics programs, it provides a strong foundation for causal inference and experimental design for students pursuing a B.S. in Statistics in a program housed in a department of statistics.[Received December 2014.

A Data Science Course for Undergraduates: Thinking With Data,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2015.1081105,OCT 2 2015,46,11,"Data science is an emerging interdisciplinary field that combines elements of mathematics, statistics, computer science, and knowledge in a particular application domain for the purpose of extracting meaningful information from the increasingly sophisticated array of data available in many settings. These data tend to be nontraditional, in the sense that they are often live, large, complex, and/or messy. A first course in statistics at the undergraduate level typically introduces students to a variety of techniques to analyze small, neat, and clean datasets. However, whether they pursue more formal training in statistics or not, many of these students will end up working with data that are considerably more complex, and will need facility with statistical computing techniques. More importantly, these students require a framework for thinking structurally about data. We describe an undergraduate course in a liberal arts environment that provides students with the tools necessary to apply data science.

"Data Science in Statistics Curricula: Preparing Students to ""Think with Data""",AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2015.1077729,OCT 2 2015,24,10,"A growing number of students are completing undergraduate degrees in statistics and entering the workforce as data analysts. In these positions, they are expected to understand how to use databases and other data warehouses, scrape data from Internet sources, program solutions to complex problems in multiple languages, and think algorithmically as well as statistically. These data science topics have not traditionally been a major component of undergraduate programs in statistics. Consequently, a curricular shift is needed to address additional learning outcomes. The goal of this article is to motivate the importance of data science proficiency and to provide examples and resources for instructors to implement data science in their own statistics curricula. We provide case studies from seven institutions. These varied approaches to teaching data science demonstrate curricular innovations to address new needs. Also included here are examples of assignments designed for courses that foster engagement of undergraduates with data and data science.[Received November 2014.

Rarely are real studies and data so straightforward. In addition, carefully curated datasets that are brought into the statistics classroom may not feel realistic to students. We provide several examples of online activities where students can quickly collect their own local data, have input on the goals of the study and draw their own conclusions. These activities focus on core statistical issues that are often challenging to teach with traditional textbooks, such as working with messy data, bias, data relevance, and reliability. This approach to teaching integrates the challenges of data in a way that encourages students to see how easy it can be to inadvertently draw misleading conclusions. These activities are designed to be highly adaptable and have proven effective in a wide variety of introductory and advanced undergraduate courses.[Received December 2014.

Combating Anti-Statistical Thinking Using Simulation-Based Methods Throughout the Undergraduate Curriculum,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2015.1081619,OCT 2 2015,44,6,"The use of simulation-based methods for introducing inferen-ce is growing in popularity for the Stat 101 course, due in part to increasing evidence of the methods ability to improve studen-ts' statistical thinking. This impact comes from simulation-based methods (a) clearly presenting the overarching logic of inference, (b) strengthening ties between statistics and probability/mathematical concepts, (c) encouraging a focus on the entire research process, (d) facilitating student thinking about advanced statistical concepts, (e) allowing more time to explore, do, and talk about real research and messy data, and (f) acting as a firm-er foundation on which to build statistical intuition. Thus, we argue that simulation-based inference should be an entry point to an undergraduate statistics program for all students, and that simulation-based inference should be used throughout all under-graduate statistics courses. To achieve this goal and fully recognize the benefits of simulation-based inference on the undergraduate statistics program, we will need to break free of historical forces tying undergraduate statistics curricula to mathematics, consider radical and innovative new pedagogical approaches in our courses, fully implement assessment-driven content innovations, and embrace computation throughout the curriculum.[Received December 2014.

Its effectiveness has been praised for increasing student participation during in-class discussions, providing hands-on engagement in real-world business problems, and increasing long-term retention rates. This article illustrates how novel case studies that mimic real-life statistical consulting engagements can be incorporated in the curriculum of an undergraduate, introductory time series course. The assessment of learning objectives as well as pedagogical implications when teaching using statistical consulting case studies is elucidated. The article also lays out guidelines for adopting statistical consulting case studies should the readers choose to incorporate the case method into the curricula of courses that they teach.

From Curriculum Guidelines to Learning Outcomes: Assessment at the Program Level,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2015.1077730,OCT 2 2015,13,1,"The 2000 ASA Guidelines for Undergraduate Statistics majors aimed to provide guidance to programs with undergraduate degrees in statistics as to the content and skills that statistics majors should be learning. The 2014 Guidelines revise the earlier guidelines to reflect changes in the discipline. As programs strive to adjust their curricula to align with the 2014 Guidelines, it is appropriate to also think about developing an assessment cycle of evaluation. This will enable programs to determine whether students are learning what we want them to learn and to work on continuously improving the program over time. The first step is to translate the broader Guidelines into institution-specific measurable learning outcomes. This article focuses on providing examples of learning outcomes developed by different institutions based on the 2000 Guidelines. The companion article by Moore and Kaplan (this issue) focuses on choosing appropriate assessment methods and rubrics and creating an assessment plan. We hope the examples provided are illustrative and that they will assist programs as they implement the 2014 Guidelines.[Received November 2014.

Program Assessment for an Undergraduate Statistics Major,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2015.1087331,OCT 2 2015,20,0,"Program assessment is used by institutions and/or departments to prompt conversations about the status of student learning and make informed decisions about educational programs. It is also typically required by accreditation agencies, such as the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) or the Western Association of Schools & Colleges (WASC). The cyclic assessment process includes four steps: establishing student learning outcomes, deciding on assessment methods, collecting and analyzing data, and reflecting on the results. The theory behind the choice of assessment methods and the use of rubrics in assessment is discussed. A description of the experiences of a Department of Statistics at a large research university during their process of developing an assessment plan for the undergraduate statistics major is provided.

We discuss what those themes are and what the ASA is doing to address them currently, and then conclude by discussing what ASA members can do to help.","History of statistics,Lemuel Shattuck,Statistical literacy,Statistics education","ASSOCIATION,OUTLOOK,HISTORY,FUTURE","Utts, Jessica@Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Stat, Irvine, CA 92697 USA@Amer Stat Assoc, Quebec City, PQ, Canada","Utts, Jessica@University of California Irvine@University of California System",not exist,"Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education: College Report+Aliaga, M.; Cobb, G.; Cuff, C.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Garfield, J.; Gould, R.; Lock, R.; Moore, T.; Rossman, A.; Stephenson, B.; Utts, J.; Velleman, P.; Witmer, J</span>.+Technical report+2010::The dilemma of the new statistics+Ayres, LP+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1927::THE FUTURE OF STATISTICS AS A DISCIPLINE+BRADLEY, RA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1982::The function of statistics in undergraduate training+Chaddock, RE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1926::Teaching Statistics: More Data, Less Lecturing+Cobb, G.+Amstat News+1991::OPPORTUNITIES FOR TEACHING AND RESEARCH+COX, GM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1945::THE HISTORY OF THE SUBSECTION ON TEACHING OF STATISTICS IN THE HEALTH-SCIENCES+DAWSONSAUNDERS, B; JONES, PK; VERHULST, SJ+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1990::no title+Fisher, A.+The Fastest Growing STEM Major in the U.

The biostatisticians at the Institute have been central to the design, conduct, monitoring, and final analyses of these trials. The uniquely favorable deck of cards the group of biostatisticians at the Institute has been dealt over the six and half decades of the group's life has led to contributions that have had a major impact on the fields of biostatistics and clinical trials. The leaders of the NHLBI and its several Divisions have valued the independence, creativity, and collaborative interactions of statisticians within the Institute. The medical problems the Institute faced impelled the statisticians to develop methodology that would address questions of great public importance. Perhaps most importantly, the individual members of the group had a collective vision passed from member to member over time that new methodology must fit the questions being asked. The group has always had the technical ability to develop new methods and the conviction that they were responsible for ensuring that they could explain their methods to the clinicians with whom they worked.",,"SEQUENTIAL CLINICAL TRIALS,SAMPLE-SIZE,HYPERTENSION PREVENTION,MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION,MORTALITY,DISEASE,SURVIVAL,TIME,EFFICIENCY,PRESSURE","DeMets, David L.@Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biostat & Med Informat, Madison, WI 53706 USA::Wittes, Janet Turk@Stat Collaborat Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA::Geller, Nancy L.@NHLBI, Off Biostat Res, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","DeMets, David L.@University of Wisconsin System@University of Wisconsin Madison::Wittes, Janet Turk@Unknow::Geller, Nancy L.@National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA@NIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI)",not exist,"Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial: design and methods+no author+Am J Cardiol.+2007::Comparison of coronary bypass surgery with angioplasty in patients with multivessel disease+Alderman, EL;

For example, if the random variable is the lifetime of a person or a machine, Markov's inequality says that the probability that an individual survives more than three times the average lifetime in the population of such individuals cannot exceed one-third. Here we give a simple, intuitive geometric interpretation and derivation of Markov's inequality. These results lead to inequalities sharper than Markov's when information about conditional expectations is available, as in reliability theory, demography, and actuarial mathematics. We use these results to sharpen Chebyshev's tail inequality also.","Survival curve,Reliability,Remaining life expectancy,Lifetime,Demography",,"Cohen, Joel E.@Rockefeller Univ, Lab Populat, Populat, New York, NY 10065 USA@Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10065 USA","Cohen, Joel E.@Columbia University@Rockefeller University",not exist,"United States Life Tables, 2008+Arias, E.+National Vital Statistics Reports+2012::no title+Bowers, N.

One way of reinforcing ethical responsibilities is through required courses covering a variety of ethics-related topics at the graduate level. We assessed ethics requirements for graduate-level statistics training programs in the United States for the 2013-2014 academic year using the websites of 88 universities, examining 103 biostatistics programs, and 136 statistics degree programs. We categorized programs' ethics training requirements as required or not required. Thirty-one (35.1%) universities required an ethics course for at least some degree students. Sixty-two (25.5%) degree programs required an ethics course for at least some students. The majority (77.4%) of required courses were worth 0 or 1 credit. Of the 177 programs without an ethics requirement, 19 (10.7%) listed an ethics elective. Although a single ethics course is insufficient for instilling an ethical approach to science, degree programs that model expectations through coursework point to the value of ethics in science. More training programs should prepare statisticians to consider the ethical dimensions of their work through required coursework.

Did the Military Interventions in the Mexican Drug War Increase Violence?,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2014.965796,JAN 2 2015,26,8,"We analyze publicly available data to estimate the causal effects of military interventions on the homicide rates in certain problematic regions in Mexico. We use the Rubin causal model to compare the post-intervention homicide rate in each intervened region to the hypothetical homicide rate for that same year had the military intervention not taken place. Because the effect of a military intervention is not confined to the municipality subject to the intervention, a nonstandard definition of units is necessary to estimate the causal effect of the intervention under the standard no-interference assumption of stable-unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA). Donor pools are created for each missing potential outcome under no intervention, thereby allowing for the estimation of unit-level causal effects. A multiple imputation approach accounts for uncertainty about the missing potential outcomes.","Matching,Donor pools,Causal inference,Rubin causal model","REGRESSION ADJUSTMENT,PROPENSITY SCORE,BIAS,DESIGN","Espinosa, Valeria@Harvard Univ, Dept Stat, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA::Rubin, Donald B.@Harvard Univ, Dept Stat, Stat, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Espinosa, Valeria@Harvard University::Rubin, Donald B.@Harvard University",not exist,"Synthetic Control Methods for Comparative Case Studies: Estimating the Effect of California's Tobacco Control Program+Abadie, Alberto; Diamond, Alexis; Hainmueller, Jens+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2010::Heart failure, chronic diuretic use, and increase in mortality and hospitalization: an observational study using propensity score methods+Ahmed, Ali; Husain, Ahsan; Love, Thomas E.; et al.+EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL+JUN 2006::no title+no author+Mexico Drug War Fast Facts+2012::Testing treatment effects in unconfounded studies under model misspecification: Logistic regression, discretization, and their combination+Cangul, M.

Maximizing Probability Bounds Under Moment-Matching Restrictions,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2014.992960,JAN 2 2015,13,0,"The problem of characterizing a distribution by its moments dates to work by Chebyshev in the mid-nineteenth century. There are clear (and close) connections with characteristic functions, moment spaces, quadrature, and other very classical mathematical pursuits. Lindsay and Basak posed the specific question of how far from normality could a distribution be if it matches k normal moments. They provided a bound on the maximal difference in cdfs, and implied that these bounds were attained. It will be shown here that in fact the bound is not attained if the number of even moments matched is odd. An explicit solution is developed as a symmetric distribution with a finite number of mass points when the number of even moments matched is even, and this bound for the even case is shown to hold as an explicit limit for the subsequent odd case. As Lindsay noted, the discrepancies can be sizable even for a moderate number of matched moments.

There have been recent advances in design and estimation, but the simple Dorfman procedure introduced by R. Dorfman in 1943 is widely used in practice. In many practical situations, the exact value of the probability p of being affected is unknown. We present both minimax and Bayesian solutions for the group size problem when p is unknown. For unbounded p, we show that the minimax solution for group size is 8, while using a Bayesian strategy with Jeffreys' prior results in a group size of 13. We also present solutions when p is bounded from above. For the practitioner, we propose strong justification for using a group size of between 8 and 13 when a constraint on p is not incorporated and provide useable code for computing the minimax group size under a constrained p.","Loss function,Optimal design,Optimization problem","COST,PRIORS,HIV,DISTRIBUTIONS,INFECTIONS,DEFECTIVES","Malinovsky, Yaakov@Univ Maryland, Dept Math & Stat, Baltimore, MD 21250 USA::Albert, Paul S.@Eunice Kennedy Shriver Natl Inst Child Hlth & Hum, Biostat & Bioinformat Branch, Div Intramural Populat Hlth Res, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Malinovsky, Yaakov@University System of Maryland@University of Maryland Baltimore::Albert, Paul S.@National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA@NIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)",not exist,"THE FORMAL DEFINITION OF REFERENCE PRIORS+Berger, James O.; Bernardo, Jose M.; Sun, Dongchu+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2009::Objective Priors for Discrete Parameter Spaces+Berger, James O.; Bernardo, Jose M.; Sun, Dongchu+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2012::REFERENCE POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTIONS FOR BAYESIAN-INFERENCE+BERNARDO, JM+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1979::INFORMATION-THEORETIC ASYMPTOTICS OF BAYES METHODS+CLARKE, BS; BARRON, AR+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY+MAY 1990::Optimal two-stage algorithms for group testing problems+De Bonis, A; Gasieniec, L; Vaccaro, U+SIAM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING+2005::NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION WITH HOMOGENEOUS GROUP TESTING DATA+Delaigle, Aurore; Hall, Peter+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 2012::The detection of defective members of large populations+Dorfman, R+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1943::no title+Du, D.; Hwang, F.

The discussion is partly in the form of an imaginary dialog between a teacher and a student, where the latter is supposed to have studied mathematical statistics for at least one semester.","Score statistic,Skewness,Symmetric confidence interval,Wald statistic",,"Andersson, Per Gosta@Stockholm Univ, Dept Stat, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Andersson, Per Gosta@Stockholm University",not exist,"A comparison of nine confidence intervals for a Poisson parameter when the expected number of events is &lt;= 5+Barker, L+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 2002::Interval estimation for a binomial proportion - Comment - Rejoinder+Brown, LD; Cai, TT; DasGupta, A; et al.+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 2001::Comparison of Poisson confidence intervals+Byrne, J; Kabaila, P+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2005::Short exact confidence intervals for the Poisson mean+Byrne, J; Kabaila, P+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2001::no title+Casella, G.; Berger, R.+Statistical Inference+2002::CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS FOR THE MEAN OF A POISSON-DISTRIBUTION - A REVIEW+SAHAI, H; KHURSHID, A+BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL+1993::Comparison of Confidence Intervals for a Poisson Mean - Further Considerations+Swift, Michael Bruce+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2009"
Bayesian Variable Selection Under Collinearity,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2015.1031827,2015,17,9,"In this article, we highlight some interesting facts about Bayesian variable selection methods for linear regression models in settings where the design matrix exhibits strong collinearity. We first demonstrate via real data analysis and simulation studies that summaries of the posterior distribution based on marginal and joint distributions may give conflicting results for assessing the importance of strongly correlated covariates. The natural question is which one should be used in practice. The simulation studies suggest that posterior inclusion probabilities and Bayes factors that evaluate the importance of correlated covariates jointly are more appropriate, and some priors may be more adversely affected in such a setting. To obtain a better understanding behind the phenomenon, we study some toy examples with Zellner's g-prior. The results show that strong collinearity may lead to a multimodal posterior distribution over models, in which joint summaries are more appropriate than marginal summaries. Thus, we recommend a routine examination of the correlation matrix and calculation of the joint inclusion probabilities for correlated covariates, in addition to marginal inclusion probabilities, for assessing the importance of covariates in Bayesian variable selection.","Bayesian model averaging,Linear regression,Marginal inclusion probability,Median probability model,Multimodality,Zellner's g-prior","PRIORS,REGULARIZATION","Ghosh, Joyee@Univ Iowa, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA::Ghattas, Andrew E.@Univ Iowa, Dept Biostat, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA","Ghosh, Joyee@University of Iowa::Ghattas, Andrew E.@University of Iowa",not exist,"Optimal predictive model selection+Barbieri, MM; Berger, JO+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2004::Posterior model probabilities via path-based pairwise priors+Berger, JO; Molina, G+STATISTICA NEERLANDICA+FEB 2005::Bayesian wavelet regression on curves with application to a spectroscopic calibration problem+Brown, PJ; Fearn, T; Vannucci, M+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2001::no title+Christensen, R.+Plane answers to complex questions+2002::Bayesian Adaptive Sampling for Variable Selection and Model Averaging+Clyde, Merlise A.; Ghosh, Joyee; Littman, Michael L.+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+MAR 2011::Benchmark priors for Bayesian model averaging+Fernandez, C; Ley, E; Steel, MFJ+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+FEB 2001::Approaches for Bayesian variable selection+George, EI; McCulloch, RE+STATISTICA SINICA+APR 1997::Rao-Blackwellization for Bayesian Variable Selection and Model Averaging in Linear and Binary Regression: A Novel Data Augmentation Approach+Ghosh, Joyee; Clyde, Merlise A.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2011::Secure Bayesian model averaging for horizontally partitioned data+Ghosh, Joyee; Reiter, Jerome P.+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+MAY 2013::no title+Kraemer, N.; Boulesteix, A.-L.+ppls: Penalized Partial Least Squares+2012::Bayesian variable selection using an adaptive powered correlation prior+Krishna, Arun; Bondell, Howard D.; Ghosh, Sujit K.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+AUG 1 2009::Mixtures of g priors for Bayesian variable selection+Liang, Feng; Paulo, Rui; Molina, German; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2008::Bayesian Regularization via Graph Laplacian+Liu, Fei; Chakraborty, Sounak; Li, Fan; et al.+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2014::Application of Near InfraredReflectance Spectroscopy to the Compositional Analysis of Biscuits and Biscuit Doughs+Osborne, B.; Fearn, T.; Miller, A.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Douglas, S</span>.+Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture+1984::On assessing prior distributions and Bayesian regression analysis using g-prior distributions+Zellner, A.+Bayesian Inference and Decision Techniques: Essays in Honor of Bruno de Finetti+1986::no title+ZELLNER A+BAYESIAN STAT+1980::Regularization and variable selection via the elastic net+Zou, H; Hastie, T+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2005"
Discreteness Causes Bias in Percentage-Based Comparisons: A Case Study From Educational Testing,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1080/00031305.2015.1031828,2015,21,2,"Discretizing continuous distributions can lead to bias in parameter estimates. We present a case study from educational testing that illustrates dramatic consequences of discreteness when discretizing partitions differ across distributions. The percentage of test takers who score above a certain cutoff score (percent above cutoff, or ""PAC"") often describes overall performance on a test. Year-over-year changes in PAC, or Delta PAC, have gained prominence under recent U.S. education policies, with public schools facing sanctions if they fail to meet PAC targets. In this article, we describe how test score distributions act as continuous distributions that are discretized inconsistently over time. We show that this can propagate considerable bias to PAC trends, where positive Delta PACs appear negative, and vice versa, for a substantial number of actual tests. A simple model shows that this bias applies to any comparison of PAC statistics in which values for one distribution are discretized differently from values for the other.","Education,Estimation,Testing",,"Yee, Darrick@Harvard Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA::Ho, Andrew@Harvard Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Educ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Yee, Darrick@Harvard University::Ho, Andrew@Harvard University",not exist,"no title+no author+CPAExamination Passing Rates+2013::Assessment - School performance will fail to meet legislated benchmarks+Bryant, M.

In simulations, the new test can detect short memory components more often than the Ljung-Box test when these short memory components are in fact within a long memory process. Interestingly, our test finds short memory autocorrelations in U.S. inflation rate data, whereas the Ljung-Box test fails to find these autocorrelations. Modeling these short memory autocorrelations of the inflation rate data leads to improved model accuracy and more precise prediction.","Autoregressive fractionally integrated moving-average,Goodness-of-fit test,Portmanteau test,Sample autocorrelation","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,FRACTIONAL-INTEGRATION,RANGE DEPENDENCE,MODELS,AUTOCORRELATIONS,STATIONARY,SAMPLE,ESTIMATORS,RATES,BIAS","Hughes, Timothy A.

The statistical foundations of the EI method,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313001750358419,MAY 2001,16,9,"A recently proposed statistical model of ecological inference (the inference of individual behavior from observations consisting of aggregated individual-level data), known by its adherents as ""EI"", has recently gained a great deal of attention both inside and outside the statistical profession. This article shows that EI is in fact an application of the standard statistical theory of prediction, though with many statistical errors, not the least of which is the failure of the author of EI to recognize the relationship between EI and prediction. Although application of the theory of prediction may improve the inference of individual behavior for any observation of the aggregated dataset, it is unlikely to improve the estimate of individual behavior derived from the use of all of the observations, which is the usual goal of ecological inference.","ecological inference,ecological regression,method of bounds,prediction",,"McCue, KF@CALTECH, Environm Qual Lab, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","McCue, KF@California Institute of Technology",not exist,"no title+[Anonymous].+A Solution to the Ecological Inference Problem: Reconstructing Individual Behavior From Aggregate Data+1997::Political methodology: A welcoming discipline+Beck, NL+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2000::no title+BICKEL PJ+MATH STAT+1977::ALTERNATIVE TO ECOLOGICAL CORRELATION+Duncan, Otis Dudley; Davis, Beverly+AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW+DEC 1953::ECOLOGICAL REGRESSION AND VOTING-RIGHTS+FREEDMAN, DA; KLEIN, SP; SACKS, J; et al.+EVALUATION REVIEW+DEC 1991::The future of ecological inference research: A comment on Freedman et al. - Response to King's comment+Freedman, DA; Ostland, M; Roberts, MR; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1999::A Solution to the Ecological Inference Problem+Freedman, David A.; Klein, S.

Also, it measures association per se between the row and column variables. The purpose of this article is to present a collection of ii definitions for the chi-squared coefficient related to either of these goals. One of the quoted definitions of the chi-squared coefficient seems especially appealing as an association measure: the averaged relative Quetelet index of category-to-category associations.","aggregation of contingency tables,category-to-category association,decomposition of the variance,summary association measure",,"Mirkin, B@Univ London Birkbeck Coll, Sch Comp Sci & Informat Syst, London WC1E 7HX, England","Mirkin, B@Birkbeck University London@University of London","Mirkin, Boris@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5470-8635","no title+BENZECRI JP+CORRESPONDENCE ANAL+1992::no title+BRILLOUIN L+SCI INFORMATION THEO+1962::no title+DIDAY E+ELEMENTS ANAL DONNEE+1982::ON PEARSON CHI-SQUARED STATISTIC FOR INDEPENDENCE IN 2-WAY CONTINGENCY-TABLES+GILULA, Z+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+1981::THE DECOMPOSABILITY AND MONOTONICITY OF PEARSON CHI-SQUARE FOR COLLAPSED CONTINGENCY-TABLES WITH APPLICATIONS+GILULA, Z; KRIEGER, AM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1983::no title+Goodman, L; Kruskal, W.+Measures of Association for Cross-Classifications+1979::SOME USEFUL EXTENSIONS OF THE USUAL CORRESPONDENCE-ANALYSIS APPROACH AND THE USUAL LOG-LINEAR MODELS APPROACH IN THE ANALYSIS OF CONTINGENCY-TABLES+GOODMAN, LA+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+DEC 1986::MEASURES OF ASSOCIATION FOR CROSS CLASSIFICATIONS+GOODMAN, LA; KRUSKAL, WH+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1954::no title+Kendall, M.; Stuart, A.+The advanced theory of statistics+1979::ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE FOR CATEGORICAL DATA+LIGHT, RJ; MARGOLIN, BH+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1971::Least-squares structuring, clustering and data processing issues+Mirkin, B+COMPUTER JOURNAL+1998::no title+MIRKIN B+GROUPING SOCIOECONOM+1985::On the criterion, that a given system of deviations from the probable in the case of a correlated system of variables is such that it can be reasonably supposed to have arisen from random sampling+Pearson, K.+Karl Pearson's Early Statistical Papers+1948::Mathematical contributions to the theory of evolution VII.

"Comparison of GEE, MINQUE, ML, and REML estimating equations for normally distributed data",AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313001750358608,MAY 2001,24,7,"Generalized estimating equations (GEE) provide a regression framework for analyzing correlated data that are not necessarily assumed to be normal. For linear mixed models assuming normality, maximum likelihood (ML) and restricted maximum likelihood (REML) are commonly used for estimating variance and covariance parameters. In the analysis of variance tradition, minimum norm quadratic unbiased estimation (MINQUE) has been developed to estimate variance and covariance components without relying on distributional assumptions. This article rewrites the ML, REML, and MINQUE estimating equations in a form similar to GEE. This form is not particularly useful for computations, but it provides a very clear picture of the similarities and differences of the four methods. The derivations are straightforward and suitable for a linear models course.","correlated data,estimated generalized least squares,generalized estimating equations,marginal model,variance-covariance parameter estimation","CORRELATED BINARY REGRESSION,LONGITUDINAL DATA-ANALYSIS,DISCRETE,MODELS","Wu, CT@Feng Chia Univ, Dept Stat, Taichung 40724, Taiwan@N Carolina State Univ, Dept Stat, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA::Gumpertz, ML@Feng Chia Univ, Dept Stat, Taichung 40724, Taiwan@N Carolina State Univ, Dept Stat, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA::Boos, DD@Feng Chia Univ, Dept Stat, Taichung 40724, Taiwan@N Carolina State Univ, Dept Stat, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Wu, CT@Feng Chia University@North Carolina State University@University of North Carolina::Gumpertz, ML@Feng Chia University@North Carolina State University@University of North Carolina::Boos, DD@Feng Chia University@North Carolina State University@University of North Carolina",not exist,"A GENERALIZED ESTIMATING EQUATIONS APPROACH FOR SPATIALLY CORRELATED BINARY DATA - APPLICATIONS TO THE ANALYSIS OF NEUROIMAGING DATA+ALBERT, PS; MCSHANE, LM+BIOMETRICS+JUN 1995::no title+BROWN GK+J AM STAT ASSOC+1978::no title+Davidian, M.; Giltinan, D.

Distributions agreeing with exchangeable sequential forecasting,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313001750358617,MAY 2001,8,1,"We follow the lines of Bruno de Finetti's ""fundamental theorem of prevision"" to characterize a very large family of distributions that agree with exchangeable forecasts conditioned only on the sum of successes in a sequence of events. This agreement is despite the fact that the sum is not a sufficient statistic for the entire family of distributions. After some introductory exposition on exchangeability and sufficiency, we first derive the most general relation that coherency requires of the simultaneous assertion of a probability mass function for the sum of N + 1 ordered events, and a conditional probability function for the final event given each possible value of the sum of the first iii events. We then apply this relation to characterize the family of all distributions on N + 1 events that agree with the exchangeable sequential forecasting equations. Surprisingly, this agreeing family is much larger than the family of exchangeable distributions, but is included within the family of all pairwise exchangeable land thus equiprobable) distributions.

Sequencing topics in introductory statistics: A debate on what to teach when,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313001750358626,MAY 2001,13,6,"We discuss various perspectives on the sequencing of topics to be studied in an introductory statistics course, debating the merits and drawbacks of different options. We focus on the introduction of data collection issues; the study of descriptive statistics for bivariate data; the presentation order of inference for means and proportions; and the placement of tests of significance and confidence intervals. Our goal is not to declare final resolution on these issues, but to stimulate instructors' thinking about this important aspect of course design.

We use that interest to motivate the learning of statistical thinking in our first-year Introduction to Statistical Methods course. We have designed a class survey that uses randomized responses. Each person does his/her own randomization with a pair of colored dice. This engages the students in the gathering and analyzing of sensitive data about his/her class in such a way that no individual's personal information is divulged. The survey gives the students a concrete situation where randomization removes the motivation to give false answers to sensitive questions. Instead, the ""false"" answers come into the data by the randomization which has a known probability structure, so the students can extract estimates of the class proportions without knowing any individual's personal information. This reinforces the message that statistical methods can only be relied on to give meaningful results when there is some known random structure underlying the data.","data analysis,privacy,randomized response,statistical thinking",,"Bolstad, WM@Univ Waikato, Dept Stat, Hamilton, New Zealand::Hunt, LA@Univ Waikato, Dept Stat, Hamilton, New Zealand::McWhirter, JL@Univ Waikato, Dept Stat, Hamilton, New Zealand","Bolstad, WM@University of Waikato::Hunt, LA@University of Waikato::McWhirter, JL@University of Waikato",not exist,"no title+Berry, D.A.+Statistics: A Bayesian Perspective+1996::no title+KITCHENS LJ+EXPLORING STAT MODER+1996::no title+Wild, C.

Visualizing the median as the minimum-deviation location,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313001750358482,MAY 2001,4,4,"The calculus proofs of this property of the median presented in mathematical statistics texts are not very instructive. A noncalculus proof has been published, but is still somewhat lengthy and likely to deter some nonmathematical readers. To make the proof more memorable, teachers can make the minimization task more real by using a concrete criterion such as total distance traveled, rather than simply an abstract sum of absolute deviations. We suggest a short, simple, heuristic graphical approach, which we illustrate using a Java applet.

Understanding the Cox regression models with time-change covariates,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313001750358491,MAY 2001,3,15,The Cox regression model is a cornerstone of modem survival analysis and is widely used in many other fields as well. But the Cox models with time-change covariates are not easy to understand or visualize. We therefore offer a simple and easy-to-understand interpretation of the (arbitrary) baseline hazard and time-change covariate. This interpretation also provides a way to simulate variables that follow a Cox model with arbitrary baseline hazard and time-change covariate.,"arbitrary baseline hazard,S-Plus code,simulation",,"Zhou, M@Univ Kentucky, Dept Stat, Lexington, KY 40506 USA","Zhou, M@University of Kentucky",not exist,"no title+Barlow, RE; Proschan, F.+Statistical theory of reliability and life testing+1981::no title+GENTLEMAN R+J COMPUTATIONAL GRAP+1996::no title+Therneau, T.+A Package for Survival Analysis in S+1999"

The abuse of power: The pervasive fallacy of power calculations for data analysis,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313001300339897,FEB 2001,41,700,"It is well known that statistical power calculations can be valuable in planning an experiment. There is also a large literature advocating that power calculations be made whenever one performs a statistical test of a hypothesis and one obtains a statistically nonsignificant result.

Conditional linear mixed models,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313001300339905,FEB 2001,29,37,"The main advantage of longitudinal studies is that they can distinguish changes over time within individuals (longitudinal effects) from differences among subjects at the Start of the study (cross-sectional effects). In observational studies, however, longitudinal changes need to be studied after correction for potential important cross-sectional differences between subjects. It will be shown that, in the context of linear mixed models, the estimation of longitudinal effects may be highly influenced by the assumptions about cross-sectional effects. Furthermore, aspects from conditional and mixture inference will be combined, yielding so-called conditional linear mixed models that allow estimation of longitudinal effects (average trends as well as subject-specific trends), independent of any cross-sectional assumptions. These models will be introduced and justified, and extensively illustrated in the analysis of longitudinal data from 680 participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging.","conditional inference,cross-sectional effects,longitudinal effects,linear mixed model,longitudinal data,mixture inference","LONGITUDINAL DATA,MIXTURE LIKELIHOODS,MIXING DISTRIBUTION,HEARING THRESHOLDS,GEOMETRY","Verbeke, G@Catholic Univ Louvain, Ctr Biostat, UZ St Rafael, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium::Spiessens, B@Catholic Univ Louvain, Ctr Biostat, UZ St Rafael, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium::Lesaffre, E@Catholic Univ Louvain, Ctr Biostat, UZ St Rafael, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium","Verbeke, G@Universite Catholique Louvain::Spiessens, B@Universite Catholique Louvain::Lesaffre, E@Universite Catholique Louvain","Verbeke, Geert@I-5587-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8430-7576","STATISTICAL-METHODS FOR STUDYING INDIVIDUAL CHANGE DURING AGING+BRANT, LJ; PEARSON, JD; MORRELL, CH; et al.+COLLEGIUM ANTROPOLOGICUM+DEC 1992::AGE-CHANGES IN PURE-TONE HEARING THRESHOLDS IN A LONGITUDINAL-STUDY OF NORMAL HUMAN AGING+BRANT, LJ; FOZARD, JL+JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA+AUG 1990::no title+Breslow, N.

How to get a job in academics,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313001300339914,FEB 2001,4,3,"Doctoral students in statistics who seek jobs in academics may know very little about the process of obtaining such a job and what they should do during their years in graduate school to improve their chances of being offered a job in academics. Although students may see job candidates present seminars in their departments, they are unlikely to be aware of what the candidate is doing during the rest of the visit to the department. They are also unlikely to gain from the experiences of other students who have gone through the job search process in previous years because those students graduate and leave and, hence, are unavailable to give advice. This article presents information and advice for students who plan to seek a job in academics. Although some of the article pertains to the interview process itself, it also gives advice for preparing for a job in academics throughout the student's years in graduate school. Much of this advice is applicable to all Ph.D. students, whether or not they go into academics. Although the advice is meant for graduate students, this article may also be a useful resource for advisors, mentors, department heads, and others who help guide students through their graduate studies.","education,graduate school",,"Stasny, EA@Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Stasny, EA@Ohio State University",not exist,"Presentation myths+Becker, RA; KellerMcNulty, S+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1996::PRESENTING STATISTICAL PAPERS+FREEMAN, DH; GONZALEZ, ME; HOAGLIN, DC; et al.+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+1983::no title+SCOTT DW+AMSTAT NEWS+1997::no title+TRUMBO BE+STAT SCI+1989"
Using model/data simulations to detect streakiness,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313001300339923,FEB 2001,11,10,A simulation-based approach is proposed for approximating a Bayesian analysis. Parameters and data are simulated from a Bayesian model and inference about a parameter is performed by exploring the set of simulated parameter values conditional on a set of values of a simulated statistic. The approach is used to learn about parameters of a streaky model on the basis of a statistic used to measure streakiness.

On asymmetric properties of the correlation coefficient in the regression setting,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313001300339932,FEB 2001,3,34,"Although correlation is a symmetric concept of two variables, this is not the case for regression where we distinguish a response from an explanatory variable. This article presents several ways of expressing the correlation coefficient as an asymmetric formula of the two variables involved in the regression setting. Contrary to some well-known results, those are not necessarily preserved in the sample when the model is wrong. As a consequence, they may be used for model checking or model selection. In particular, we propose a criterion for choosing the response variable in a simple linear regression problem. An example from the domain of finance illustrates our purpose.

Unfortunately, they are often incorrectly viewed as an error probability for rejection of the hypothesis or, even worse, as the posterior probability that the hypothesis is true. The fact that these interpretations can be completely misleading when testing precise hypotheses is first reviewed, through consideration of two revealing simulations.

Power priors and their use in clinical trials,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313006X109269,MAY 2006,23,10,"This article reviews power priors, a class of prior distributions for an unknown parameter that exploits information from results of previous, similar studies, a situation arising often in clinical trials. The article shows that, for independent and identically distributed historical data, a basic formulation of power priors (geometric priors) can be obtained as the result of a prior updating-and-combining process based on training samples of iid historical data. This formulation gives an operational justification to power priors. It also allows us to relate the discount scalar quantity controlling the influence of historical information on final inference to the size of training samples. Properties of power priors and their extension to more complex set-ups are discussed. Then several examples are provided of their use in the analysis of clinical trials data. The approach is shown to be appropriate for handling problems arising when information is combined from different studies, such as lack of exchangeability between preceding and current data, and the risk that prior information overwhelms evidence from the Study in question.","conjugate analysis,elicitation,geometric priors,objective Bayesian analysis,prediction,training sample","PRIOR DISTRIBUTIONS,MODEL SELECTION,BAYES FACTORS","De Santis, F@Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Stat Probabil & Stat Applicate, I-00185 Rome, Italy","De Santis, F@Sapienza University Rome","DE SANTIS, Fulvio@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1729-1759","Objective Bayesian methods for model selection: introduction and comparison+Berger, J.

User-friendly introduction to link-probit-normal models,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313006X110203,MAY 2006,37,9,"Probit-normal models have attractive properties compared to logit-normal models. In particular, they allow for easy specification of marginal links of interest while permitting a conditional random effects structure. Moreover, programming fitting algorithms for probit-normal models can be trivial with the use of well-developed algorithms for approximating multivariate normal quantiles. In typical settings, data cannot distinguish between probit and logit conditional link functions. Therefore, if marginal interpretations are desired, the default conditional link should be the most convenient one. We refer to models with a probit conditional link, an arbitrary marginal link, and a normal random effect distribution as link-probit-normal models. In this article we outline these models and discuss appropriate situations for using multivariate normal approximations for estimation. Unlike other articles in this area that focus oil very general situations and implement Markov chain or MCEM algorithms, we focus oil simpler settings and give a collection of user-friendly examples. Marginally, the link-probit-normal model is obtained by a nonlinear model on a discretized multivariate normal distribution, and thus can be thought of as a special case of discretizing a multivariate T distribution, as the degrees of freedom go to infinity. We also consider the larger class of multivariate T marginal models and illustrate how these models can be used to closely approximate a logit link.","binary outcomes,generalized linear mixed models,maximum likelihood,nonlinear mixed effects models","MULTIVARIATE-T-PROBABILITIES,LIKELIHOOD INFERENCE,BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS,LONGITUDINAL DATA,BINARY DATA,DISCRETE,COMPUTATION,REGRESSION,JOINT","Caffo, B@Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Johns Hopkins Biosat Ctr, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA::Griswold, M@Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Johns Hopkins Biosat Ctr, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Caffo, B@Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health@Johns Hopkins University::Griswold, M@Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health@Johns Hopkins University",not exist,"no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical Data Analysis+2002::Evaluating agreement and disagreement among movie reviewers+Agresti, A.; Winner, L.+Chance+1997::no title+Albert, J; Chib, S.+Bayesian modeling of binary repeated measures data with application to crossover trials+1996::Bayesian analysis of binary and polychotomous responses data+Albert, J.; Chib, S.+J.

"The boxer, the wrestler, and the coin flip: A paradox of robust Bayesian inference and belief functions",AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313006X106190,MAY 2006,23,18,"Bayesian inference requires all unknowns to be represented by probability distributions, which awkwardly implies that the probability of an event for which we are completely ignorant (e.g., that the world's greatest boxer would defeat the world's greatest wrestler) must be assigned a particular numerical value such as 1/2, as if it were known as precisely as the probability of a truly random event (e.g., a coin flip).

Robust Bayes and belief functions are two methods that have been proposed to distinguish ignorance and randomness. In robust Bayes, a parameter can be restricted to a range, but without a prior distribution, yielding a range of potential posterior inferences. In belief functions (also known as the Dempster-Shafer theory), probability mass can be assigned to subsets of parameter space, so that randomness is represented by the probability distribution and uncertainty is represented by large subsets, within which the model does not attempt to assign probabilities.

Through a simple example involving a coin flip and a boxing/wrestling match, we illustrate difficulties with robust Bayes and belief functions. In short: robust Bayes allows ignorance to spread too broadly, and belief functions inappropriately collapse to simple Bayesian models.","Dempster-Shafer theory,epistemic and aleatory uncertainty,foundations of probability,ignorance,robust Bayes,subjective prior distribution",SETS,"Gelman, A@Columbia Univ, Dept Stat, New York, NY 10027 USA@Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA","Gelman, A@Columbia University@Columbia University",not exist,"The robust Bayesian viewpoint (with discussion)+Berger, J.

A spatial analysis of basketball shot chart data,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313006X90305,FEB 2006,17,8,"Basketball coaches at all levels use shot charts to study shot locations and outcomes for their own teams as well as upcoming opponents. Shot charts are simple plots of the location and result of each shot taken during a game. Although shot chart data are rapidly increasing in richness and availability, most coaches still use them purely as descriptive summaries. However, a team's ability to defend a certain player could potentially be improved by using shot data to make inferences about the player's tendencies and abilities. This article develops hierarchical spatial models for shot-chart data, which allow for spatially varying effects of covariates. Our spatial models permit differential smoothing of the fitted surface in two spatial directions, which naturally correspond to polar coordinates: distance to the basket and angle from the line connecting the two baskets. We illustrate our approach using the 2003-2004 shot chart data for Minnesota Timberwolves guard Sam Cassell.","Bayesian,conditionally autoregressive prior,sports","STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS,MODELS","Reich, BJ@N Carolina State Univ, Dept Stat, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA@Univ Minnesota, Div Biostat, Sch Publ Hlth, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA::Hodges, JS@N Carolina State Univ, Dept Stat, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA@Univ Minnesota, Div Biostat, Sch Publ Hlth, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA::Carlin, BP@N Carolina State Univ, Dept Stat, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA@Univ Minnesota, Div Biostat, Sch Publ Hlth, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA::Reich, AM@N Carolina State Univ, Dept Stat, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA@Univ Minnesota, Div Biostat, Sch Publ Hlth, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Reich, BJ@North Carolina State University@University of North Carolina@University of Minnesota Twin Cities@University of Minnesota System::Hodges, JS@North Carolina State University@University of North Carolina@University of Minnesota Twin Cities@University of Minnesota System::Carlin, BP@North Carolina State University@University of North Carolina@University of Minnesota Twin Cities@University of Minnesota System::Reich, AM@North Carolina State University@University of North Carolina@University of Minnesota Twin Cities@University of Minnesota System",not exist,"A STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS OF HITTING STREAKS IN BASEBALL+ALBRIGHT, SC+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1993::SPATIAL INTERACTION AND STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS OF LATTICE SYSTEMS+BESAG, J+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1974::Bayesian analysis of agricultural field experiments+Besag, J; Higdon, D+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1999::Nonconjugate Bayesian estimation of covariance matrices and its use in hierarchical models+Daniels, MJ; Kass, RE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1999::Proper multivariate conditional autoregressive models for spatial data analysis+Gelfand, AE; Vounatsou, P+BIOSTATISTICS+JAN 2003::THE HOT HAND IN BASKETBALL - ON THE MISPERCEPTION OF RANDOM SEQUENCES+GILOVICH, T; VALLONE, R; TVERSKY, A+COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY+1985::no title+HAMILTON B+SAINT P PIONEER 0509+2004::no title+HICKSON DA+SPATIAL ANAL BASKETB+2003::R: A language for data analysis and graphics+Ihaka, R.; Gentleman, R.+J.

"""Last licks"": Do they really help?",AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313006X90350,FEB 2006,23,1,"Much has been written about the home field advantage in sports. Baseball and softball are Unusual games, in that the rules are explicitly different for home versus visiting teams, since by rule home teams bat second in each inning (they have ""last licks""). This is generally considered to be an advantage, which seems to be contradicted by the apparent weakness of the home field advantage in baseball compared to that in other sports. In this article we examine the effect of ""last licks"" on baseball and softball team success using neutral site college baseball and softball playoff games. We find little evidence of an effect in baseball, but much greater evidence in softball, related to whether a game is close late in the game. In softball games that are tied at the end of an inning batting last seems to be disadvantageous later in the game, apparently related to the chances of the team scoring first to break the tie. Since the database also includes games where one team is playing on its home field, we are also able to say something about benefits from playing at home that are not related to ""last licks.""","baseball,home advantage,softball","HOME ADVANTAGE,CHAMPIONSHIP PRESSURES,SPORTS,AUDIENCES,BASEBALL,PROGRESS,MODEL,GAME,1ST","Simon, GA@NYU, Leonard N Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10012 USA::Simonoff, JS@NYU, Leonard N Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10012 USA","Simon, GA@New York University::Simonoff, JS@New York University","Simonoff, Jeffrey@A-6765-2008","Rating teams and analysing outcomes in one-day and test cricket+Allsopp, PE; Clarke, SR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+2004::no title+*ASS PRESS+CHRISTIAN SCI M 1117+1949::DISPUTING THE EFFECTS OF CHAMPIONSHIP PRESSURES AND HOME AUDIENCES+BAUMEISTER, RF+JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY+APR 1995::PARADOXICAL EFFECTS OF SUPPORTIVE AUDIENCES ON PERFORMANCE UNDER PRESSURE - THE HOME FIELD DISADVANTAGE IN SPORTS CHAMPIONSHIPS+BAUMEISTER, RF; STEINHILBER, A+JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY+1984::Baseball+Bennett, J.+Statistics in Sport+1998::no title+BRAY SR+SPORT SCI ASS ALBERT+2003::THE HOME ADVANTAGE IN SPORT COMPETITIONS - A LITERATURE-REVIEW+COURNEYA, KS; CARRON, AV+JOURNAL OF SPORT &amp; EXERCISE PSYCHOLOGY+MAR 1992::BATTING 1ST VERSUS LAST - IMPLICATIONS FOR THE HOME ADVANTAGE+COURNEYA, KS; CARRON, AV+JOURNAL OF SPORT &amp; EXERCISE PSYCHOLOGY+SEP 1990::IMPORTANCE OF GAME LOCATION AND SCORING 1ST IN COLLEGE BASEBALL+COURNEYA, KS+PERCEPTUAL AND MOTOR SKILLS+OCT 1990::HOME ADVANTAGE - DOES IT EXIST IN WOMENS SPORTS+GAYTON, WF; MUTRIE, SA; HEARNS, JF+PERCEPTUAL AND MOTOR SKILLS+OCT 1987::A comparison of goodness-of-fit tests for the logistic regression model+Hosmer, DW; Hosmer, T; leCessie, S; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+MAY 15 1997::PROGRESS OF SCORE DURING A BASEBALL GAME+LINDSEY, GR+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1961::no title+NEMEC D+OFFICIAL RULES BASEB+1999::Home advantage in sport - An overview of studies on the advantage of playing at home+Nevill, AM; Holder, RL+SPORTS MEDICINE+OCT 1999::CHAMPIONSHIP PRESSURES - CHOKING OR TRIUMPHING IN ONES OWN TERRITORY+SCHLENKER, BR; PHILLIPS, ST; BONIECKI, KA; et al.+JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY+APR 1995::HOME ADVANTAGE+SCHWARTZ, B; BARSKY, SF+SOCIAL FORCES+1977::no title+Simonoff, J.

As effect measures, absolute difference (D) and percent change (PC) are used more than symmetrized percent change (SPC). However, all these measures alter the dependency structure with B and their distributions can differ from B and F. To examine their interpretability and relative performance, we considered simulations under independence and additive and multiplicative correlation structures for parametric and nonparametric analyses. Under independence, nonparametric analysis on F had the greatest power. Elsewhere, simple ANOVA on SPC had power equal to or greater than alternative analysis methods.","change from baseline,expanded baseline eligibility,measure of treatment effect,required sample size,robust percent change",,"Berry, DA@Univ Texas, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Biostat & Appl Math, Houston, TX 77030 USA::Ayers, GD@Univ Texas, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Biostat & Appl Math, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Berry, DA@UTMD Anderson Cancer Center@University of Texas System::Ayers, GD@UTMD Anderson Cancer Center@University of Texas System",not exist,"LOGARITHMIC TRANSFORMATIONS IN ANOVA+BERRY, DA+BIOMETRICS+JUN 1987::no title+BERRY DA+STAT METHODOLOGY PHA+1989::Sympercents: symmetric percentage differences on the 100 log(e) scale simplify the presentation of log transformed data+Cole, TJ+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+NOV 30 2000::ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE USING THE RANK TRANSFORMATION+CONOVER, WJ; IMAN, RL+BIOMETRICS+1982::ADJUSTING FOR BASELINE - CHANGE OR PERCENTAGE CHANGE+KAISER, L+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+OCT 1989::On a primary efficacy endpoint+Koti, KM+DRUG INFORMATION JOURNAL+JAN-MAR 2001::FURTHER COMPARATIVE ANALYSES OF PRETEST-POSTTEST RESEARCH DESIGNS+LAIRD, N+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+1983::no title+SENN S+STAT ISSUES DRUG DEV+1997::no title+Steel, R.G.D.; Torrie, J.H.+Principles and procedures of statistics+1980::no title+Tukey, JW.+Exploratory data analysis+1977"

Being warren buffett: A classroom simulation of risk and wealth when investing in the stock market,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313006X90378,FEB 2006,3,3,"Students who are new to statistics and its role in modern finance have a hard time making the connection between variance and risk. To link these, we developed a classroom Simulation in which groups of students roll dice that simulate the success of three investments. The simulated investments behave quite differently: one remains almost constant, another drifts slowly upward. and the third climbs to extremes or plummets. As the simulation proceeds, some groups have great success with this last investment-they become the ""Warren Buffetts"" of the class, accumulating far greater wealth than their classmates. For most groups, however, this last investment leads to ruin because of its volatility, the variance in its returns. The marked difference in outcomes surprises students who discover how hard it is to separate luck from skill. The simulation also demonstrates how portfolios. weighted combinations of investments, reduce the variance. Students discover that a Mixture of two poor investments emerges as a surprising performer. After this experience, our students immediately associate financial volatility with variance. This lesson also introduces Students to the history of the stock market in the U.S. We calibrated the returns on two simulated investments to mimic returns on U.S. Treasury Bills and stocks.","geometric mean,long-run return,portfolio,volatility drag",,"Foster, DP@Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Dept Stat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA::Stine, RA@Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Dept Stat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Foster, DP@University of Pennsylvania::Stine, RA@University of Pennsylvania",not exist,"no title+Cover, T.

A two-player game consists of repeated tosses of a loaded coin, until one of the player's three outcome sequences-for example, Tails, Heads, Tails (THT)-occurs. Player 2 chooses his or her sequence after hearing Player 1's choice. The question is, if we know that the probability of Heads is 70%, does Player I or Player 2 have the advantage? To their detriment, nearly all students will want to go first and select HHH, which is not even the best choice for the universally disadvantaged Player 1.

Mathematical statistics courses for undergraduate senior or first-year graduate students should expose students to some properties of the mixture model.

Simultaneous confidence intervals for two estimable functions and their ratio under a linear model,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313005X70605,NOV 2005,13,9,"This article considers the problem of finding simultaneous confidence intervals for two estimable functions of linear model parameters and their ratio. A pertinent example is the dominance ratio in crossing experiments with plants and animals, which is computed from an estimate of the dominance and additive gene effects. Breeders are usually interested in inferences on the ratio along with the effect estimates. We investigate several solutions to the problem. One proposal uses a plug-in approach, based on the multivariate-t distribution, which is shown by simulation to have good small-sample properties. A conservative method is proposed, which operates under a worst-case scenario. Both methods yield simultaneous coverage probabilities closer to the nominal level than the Scheffe or Bonferrom method. The methods are illustrated using two real examples, one from the Child Health and Development Studies and one from plant breeding.

Illustrating the impact of a time-varying covariate with an extended Kaplan-Meier estimator,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313005X70371,NOV 2005,18,89,"In clinical endpoint trials, the association between a baseline covariate and the risk of an endpoint is often measured by the hazard ratio as calculated by a Cox regression model, and illustrated by Kaplan-Meier curves comparing cohorts defined by levels of the covariate. The Cox regression model is easily extended to the case of time-varying covariates; however, there is no clear approach for similarly extending the standard Kaplan-Meier estimator. Various ad hoc procedures that have been used in the medical literature are seriously flawed. This article discusses an extended Kaplan-Meier estimator that can be used with time-varying covariates and illustrates this method using data from a long-term clinical trial.","clinical trial,cox regression model,endpoint,graphical method,RENAAL","END-POINT TRIALS,INFORMATIVE NONCOMPLIANCE,HEART-FAILURE,SURVIVAL,OUTCOMES,EVENT,REGRESSION,MODEL","Snapinn, SM@Amgen Inc, Newbury Pk, CA 91320 USA@Temple Univ, Dept Stat, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA::Jiang, Q@Amgen Inc, Newbury Pk, CA 91320 USA@Temple Univ, Dept Stat, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA::Iglewicz, B@Amgen Inc, Newbury Pk, CA 91320 USA@Temple Univ, Dept Stat, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA","Snapinn, SM@Amgen@Temple University@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)::Jiang, Q@Amgen@Temple University@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)::Iglewicz, B@Amgen@Temple University@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)",not exist,"Prognostic importance of weight loss in chronic heart failure and the effect of treatment with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors: an observational study+Anker, SD; Negassa, A; Coats, AJS; et al.+LANCET+MAR 29 2003::Prevention of heart failure in patients in the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study+Arnold, JMO; Yusuf, S; Young, J; et al.+CIRCULATION+MAR 11 2003::Statistics notes - Survival probabilities (the Kaplan-Meier method)+Bland, JM; Altman, DG+BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL+DEC 5 1998::Effects of losartan on renal and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy+Brenner, BM; Cooper, ME; de Zeeuw, D; et al.+NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE+SEP 20 2001::AGE-ADJUSTED SURVIVAL CURVES WITH APPLICATION IN THE FRAMINGHAM-STUDY+CUPPLES, LA; GAGNON, DR; RAMASWAMY, R; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+AUG 30 1995::Event history graphs for censored survival data+Dubin, JA; Muller, HG; Wang, JL+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+OCT 15 2001::Time-dependent covariates in the Cox proportional-hazards regression model+Fisher, LD; Lin, DY+ANNUAL REVIEW OF PUBLIC HEALTH+1999::GRAPHICAL METHODS FOR CENSORED-DATA+GENTLEMAN, R; CROWLEY, J+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1991::A KERNEL-METHOD FOR INCORPORATING INFORMATION ON DISEASE PROGRESSION IN THE ANALYSIS OF SURVIVAL+GRAY, RJ+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1994::Calculation of sample size in survival trials: The impact of informative noncompliance+Jiang, Q; Snapinn, S; Iglewicz, B+BIOMETRICS+SEP 2004::Accounting for informative non-compliance with a bivariate exponential model in the design of endpoint trials+Jiang, Q; Snapinn, S; Iglewicz, B+PHARMACEUTICAL STATISTICS+JUL-SEP 2005::NONPARAMETRIC-ESTIMATION FROM INCOMPLETE OBSERVATIONS+KAPLAN, EL; MEIER, P+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1958::Reduction of cardiovascular risk by regression of electrocardiographic markers of left ventricular hypertrophy by the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril+Mathew, J; Sleight, P; Lonn, E; et al.+CIRCULATION+OCT 2 2001::Nonparametric survival estimation using prognostic longitudinal covariates+Murray, S; Tsiatis, AA+BIOMETRICS+MAR 1996::Survival plots of time-to-event outcomes in clinical trials: good practice and pitfalls+Pocock, SJ; Clayton, TC; Altman, DG+LANCET+MAY 11 2002::A NON-PARAMETRIC GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SURVIVAL AND THE OCCURRENCE OF AN EVENT - APPLICATION TO RESPONDER VERSUS NON-RESPONDER BIAS+SIMON, R; MAKUCH, RW+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+1984::Informative noncompliance in endpoint trials+Snapinn, SM; Jiang, Q; Iglewicz, B+CURRENT CONTROLLED TRIALS IN CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE+JUL 3 2004::An extended Kaplan-Meier estimator and its applications+Strauss, D; Shavelle, R+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+MAY 15 1998"

Rethinking the paper helicopter: Combining statistical and engineering knowledge,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313005X70777,NOV 2005,7,7,"Box's paper helicopter has been used to teach experimental design for more than a decade. It is simple, inexpensive, and provides real data for an involved, multifactor experiment. Unfortunately it can also further an all-too-common practice that Professor Box himself has repeatedly cautioned against, namely ignoring the fundamental science while rushing to solve problems that may not be sufficiently understood. Often this slighting of the science so as to get on with the statistics is justified by referring to Box's oft-quoted maxim that ""All models are wrong, however some are useful."" Nevertheless, what is equally true, to paraphrase both Professor Box and George Orwell, is that ""All models are wrong, but some are more wrong than others."" To experiment effectively it is necessary to understand the relevant science so as to distinguish between what is usefully wrong, and what is dangerously wrong.

This article presents an improved analysis of Box's helicopter problem relying on statistical and engineering knowledge and shows that this leads to an enhanced paper helicopter, requiring fewer experimental trails and achieving superior performance. In fact, of the 20 experimental trials run for validation-10 each of the proposed aerodynamic design and the conventional full factorial optimum-the longest 10 flight times all belong to the aerodynamic optimum, while the shortest 10 all belong to the conventional full factorial optimum. I further discuss how ancillary engineering knowledge can be incorporated into thinking about-and teaching-ex peri mental design.","aerodynamics,engineering education,experimental design,factorial,nonlinear,quadratic",,"Annis, DH@USN, Postgrad Sch, Monterey, CA 93943 USA","Annis, DH@United States Department of Defense@Naval Postgraduate School@United States Navy",not exist,"no title+Avallone, E.

A ranking method based on minimizing the number of in-sample errors,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313005X54883,AUG 2005,14,3,"This article introduces a simple Bayesian method for ranking college football teams. The parameter space is the set of all possible rankings, and individual game results are modeled by taking the odds that the lower ranked team wins to be beta : 1, where beta < 1. As a result, the likelihood for a given ranking is a function solely of the number of in-sample errors, and by choosing the parameter beta to be very close to zero, we may effectively minimize the number of in-sample errors. We propose both a modified Gibbs sampler algorithm for exploring the posterior distribution and an associated importance sampling scheme for examining the impact of individual games on the posterior mean ranks. We rank teams according to their posterior mean ranks, and we use simulations to compare the performance of this ranking to that of rankings produced by standard methods that use the same (win/loss only) information. We find that the new method is almost as good as standard methods in predicting unknown game results, while far outdoing standard methods in matching known game results. An outlier-resistance property of the ranking method is illustrated using the importance sampling scheme.","Bayesian methods,Gibbs sampler,importance sampling,paired comparisons,rankings,Rao-Blackwellization","COLLEGE FOOTBALL TEAMS,STATISTICS","Frey, J@Ohio State Univ, Dept Stat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Frey, J@Ohio State University",not exist,"RANK ANALYSIS OF INCOMPLETE BLOCK DESIGNS .1.

Measuring relative importance of sources of variation without using variance,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313005X55170,AUG 2005,19,2,"This article proposes a new parameter, the group or class dominance probability, to measure the relative importance of random effects in one-way random effects models. This parameter is the probability the group random effect is larger in absolute size than the individual (or error) random effect. The new parameter compares the middle part of the distributions of the two sources of variation, and pays little attention to the tails of the distributions. This is in contrast to the traditional approach of comparing the variances of the random effects, which can be heavily influenced by the tails of the distributions. We suggest parametric and nonparametric estimators of the group dominance probability, and demonstrate the applicability of the ideas using data on blood pressure measurements.","bootstrap confidence interval,class dominance probability,group dominance probability,one-way random effects model,variance component",INTRACLASS CORRELATION-COEFFICIENT,"Harris, IR@So Methodist Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Dallas, TX 75275 USA@No Arizona Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA::Burch, BD@So Methodist Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Dallas, TX 75275 USA@No Arizona Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA","Harris, IR@Southern Methodist University@Northern Arizona University::Burch, BD@Southern Methodist University@Northern Arizona University",not exist,"no title+Airy, G.

Take the largest in the first of n sets, each of the n random items, the second largest in the second set, and so on to the smallest in the nth set. The sample of n items selected in this way is an unbiased sample of the population. For typical unimodal distributions the mean of such a sample is slightly less than (n+1)/2 times more efficient than the mean of n items taken at random.

Six online statistics courses: Examination and review,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313005X54162,AUG 2005,42,14,"We extend George W. Cobb's evaluative framework of statistics textbooks to six online instructional materials that exemplify the diversity of introductory statistics materials available on the Internet. Materials range from course Web sites with limited interactive capabilities to courseware and electronic textbooks that make extensive use of interactive learning objects and environments. Instructional materials are examined in light of recent cognitive research that underscores the robustness of learning from examples, the importance of authentic problem solving in promoting knowledge in use and skill acquisition, and the use of feedback to maximize learning opportunities. Selected units that focus on statistical tools (measures of central tendency, simple linear regression, and one-way analysis of variance) are analyzed in terms of authenticity and diversity of examples, authenticity and cognitive complexity of exercises, and use of interactive learning objects and feedback. General conclusions and suggestions for future directions for online statistics instruction are presented.","distance learning,evaluation,Web-based instruction","INTERACTIVITY,INSTRUCTION,EXAMPLES,SCIENCE,GRAPHS,LEARN","Larreamendy-Joerns, J@Univ Los Andes, Dept Psychol, Bogota, Colombia@Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA::Leinhardt, G@Univ Los Andes, Dept Psychol, Bogota, Colombia@Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA::Corredor, J@Univ Los Andes, Dept Psychol, Bogota, Colombia@Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Larreamendy-Joerns, J@University of the Andes Colombia@University of Pittsburgh@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)::Leinhardt, G@University of the Andes Colombia@University of Pittsburgh@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)::Corredor, J@University of the Andes Colombia@University of Pittsburgh@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)",not exist,"An effective metacognitive strategy: learning by doing and explaining with a computer-based Cognitive Tutor+Aleven, VAWMM; Koedinger, KR+COGNITIVE SCIENCE+MAR-APR 2002::no title+Anderson, J.

The Bayesian two-sample t test,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313005X55233,AUG 2005,24,26,"This article shows how the pooled-variance two-sample t statistic arises from a Bayesian formulation of the two-sided point null testing problem, with emphasis on teaching. We identify a reasonable and useful prior giving a closed-form Bayes factor that can be written in terms of the distribution of the two-sample t statistic under the null and alternative hypotheses, respectively. This provides a Bayesian motivation for the two-sample t statistic, which has heretofore been buried as a special case of more complex linear models, or given only roughly via analytic or Monte Carlo approximations. The resulting formulation of the Bayesian test is easy to apply in practice, and also easy to teach in an introductory course that emphasizes Bayesian methods. The priors are easy to use and simple to elicit, and the posterior probabilities are easily computed using available software, in some cases using spreadsheets.","Bayes factor,posterior probability,prior elicitation,teaching Bayesian statistics","PERSPECTIVE,HYPOTHESIS,LIKELIHOOD","Gonen, M@Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, New York, NY 10021 USA@Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Stat, Irvine, CA 92697 USA@Texas Tech Univ, Dept Informat Syst & Quantitat Sci, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA::Johnson, WO@Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, New York, NY 10021 USA@Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Stat, Irvine, CA 92697 USA@Texas Tech Univ, Dept Informat Syst & Quantitat Sci, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA::Lu, YG@Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, New York, NY 10021 USA@Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Stat, Irvine, CA 92697 USA@Texas Tech Univ, Dept Informat Syst & Quantitat Sci, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA::Westfall, PH@Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, New York, NY 10021 USA@Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Stat, Irvine, CA 92697 USA@Texas Tech Univ, Dept Informat Syst & Quantitat Sci, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA","Gonen, M@Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center@University of California Irvine@University of California System@Texas Tech University System@Texas Tech University::Johnson, WO@Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center@University of California Irvine@University of California System@Texas Tech University System@Texas Tech University::Lu, YG@Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center@University of California Irvine@University of California System@Texas Tech University System@Texas Tech University::Westfall, PH@Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center@University of California Irvine@University of California System@Texas Tech University System@Texas Tech University","Gonen, Mithat@E-4826-2012","Teaching Bayes' rule: A data-oriented approach+Albert, J+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 1997::no title+ALBERT J+WORKSH STAT DISCOVER+2001::Bayesian testing and estimation of association in a two-way contingency table+Albert, JH+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1997::no title+Antelman, G.+Elementary bayesian statistics+1997::TESTING A POINT NULL HYPOTHESIS - THE IRRECONCILABILITY OF P-VALUES AND EVIDENCE+BERGER, JO; SELLKE, T+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1987::Unified frequentist and Bayesian testing of a precise hypothesis+Berger, JO; Boukai, B; Wang, Y+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+AUG 1997::no title+Bernardo, J.

However, for certain types of random variables, the PGF may be more appealing. For example, sums of independent, non-negative, integer-valued random variables with finite support are easily studied via the PGF. In particular, the exact distribution of the sum can easily be calculated. Several illustrative classroom examples, with varying degrees of difficulty, are presented.

Evaluation criteria for discrete confidence intervals: Beyond coverage and length,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313005X42453,MAY 2005,15,10,"Confidence intervals for discrete distributions are often evaluated only by coverage and expected length. We discuss two additional criteria, p-confidence and p-bias. The choice of these criteria is motivated by the interpretation of a confidence interval as being the set of parameter values not rejected by a hypothesis test. Using these additional criteria we compare a number of equal-tailed confidence intervals for the binomial distribution. It is shown that methods that, produce superior intervals, as measured by coverage and length, need not perform well in terms of p-confidence and p-bias. Cox's measuring device example is discussed to motivate the need for criteria beyond coverage and length.","bias,confidence,coverage probability,interval length,p value",PROPORTIONS,"Vos, PW@E Carolina Univ, Dept Biostat, Greenville, NC 27858 USA::Hudson, S@E Carolina Univ, Dept Biostat, Greenville, NC 27858 USA","Vos, PW@University of North Carolina@East Carolina University::Hudson, S@University of North Carolina@East Carolina University",not exist,"Approximate is better than ""exact"" for interval estimation of binomial proportions+Agresti, A; Coull, BA+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1998::Dealing with discreteness: making 'exact' confidence intervals for proportions, differences of proportions, and odds ratios more exact+Agresti, A+STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH+JAN 2003::Confidence curves and improved exact confidence intervals for discrete distributions+Blaker, H+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+DEC 2000::BINOMIAL CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS+BLYTH, CR; STILL, HA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1983::Interval estimation for a binomial proportion - Comment - Rejoinder+Brown, LD; Cai, TT; DasGupta, A; et al.+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 2001::The use of confidence or fiducial limits illustrated in the case of the binomial.+Clopper, CJ; Pearson, ES+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1934::no title+Cox, D.

Understanding heterogeneity in generalized mixed and frailty models,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313005X43236,MAY 2005,8,16,Variance components are useful parameters to quantify the different sources of randomness in hierarchical models. Interpreting the variance components in generalized mixed and frailty models is not straightforward because the variance is not directly related to quantities with a biological meaning. We therefore investigate how the estimated values of the variance components affect the variability of specific quantities of interest such as the prevalence or the median time to event. We discuss two examples from veterinary science with clustering between animals and show for these examples how variance components can be interpreted in the case of a binary and time-to-event response variable.,"logistic regression,random effects,survival data,variance components",,"Duchateau, L@State Univ Ghent, Fac Med Vet, Dept Physiol Biochem & Biometr, B-9820 Merelbeke, Belgium@Limburgs Univ Ctr, Ctr Stat, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium::Janssen, P@State Univ Ghent, Fac Med Vet, Dept Physiol Biochem & Biometr, B-9820 Merelbeke, Belgium@Limburgs Univ Ctr, Ctr Stat, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium","Duchateau, L@Ghent University@Hasselt University::Janssen, P@Ghent University@Hasselt University",not exist,"no title+BROWN H+APPL MIXED MODELS ME+1999::Variances are not always nuisance parameters+Carroll, RJ+BIOMETRICS+JUN 2003::The shared frailty model and the power for heterogeneity tests in multicenter trials+Duchateau, L; Janssen, P; Lindsey, P; et al.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+SEP 28 2002::no title+DUCHATEAU L+LINEAR MIXED MODELS+1999::no title+Klein, J; Moeschberger, M.+Survival Analysis: Techniques for Censored and Truncated Data+2003::no title+McCulloch, C.; Searle, S.

A bootstrap test of stochastic equality of two populations,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313005X23526,MAY 2005,29,36,"When comparing two variables with nonnormal distributions, application of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test (WMW) is a common choice. However, it is only valid to test the null hypothesis stating equality of the distributions. Sometimes the hypothesis of interest is H-0 : P(X < Y) = P(X > Y) against P(X < Y) not equal P(X > Y), called stochastic equality and inequality. Here we propose a bootstrap test for this problem. Results of an extensive simulation study based on empirical distributions suggest that the new test is valid for a wide range of problems in parasitology and psychology, and the loss of power as compared to WMW is rather small in those cases when both tests are applicable.","Brunner-Munzel test,Mann-Whitney U-test,Rank Welch test,stochastic equality,Wilcoxon rank sum test","RANK TRANSFORMATIONS,T-TEST,STATISTICS,SAMPLES,VARIANCES,COSTS,POWER","Reiczigel, J@Natl Ctr Epidemiol, Budapest, Hungary::Zakarias, I@Natl Ctr Epidemiol, Budapest, Hungary::Rozsa, L@Natl Ctr Epidemiol, Budapest, Hungary","Reiczigel, J@Unknow::Zakarias, I@Unknow::Rozsa, L@Unknow","Rozsa, Lajos@F-9727-2010@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9470-0934","A class of Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon type statistics+Ahmad, IA+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+NOV 1996::Increasing physicians' awareness of the impact of statistics on research outcomes: Comparative power of the t-test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test in small samples applied research+Bridge, PD; Sawilowsky, SS+JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY+MAR 1999::The nonparametric Behrens-Fisher problem: Asymptotic theory and a small-sample approximation+Brunner, E; Munzel, U+BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL+2000::Parasitology meets ecology on its own terms: Margolis et al revisited+Bush, AO; Lafferty, KD; Lotz, JM; et al.+JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY+AUG 1997::RANK TRANSFORMATIONS AS A BRIDGE BETWEEN PARAMETRIC AND NONPARAMETRIC STATISTICS+CONOVER, WJ; IMAN, RL+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+1981::no title+Davison, AC; Hinkley, DV.+Bootstrap methods and their applications+1997::Comparing several robust tests of stochastic equality with ordinally scaled variables and small to moderate sized samples+Delaney, HD; Vargha, A+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+DEC 2002::Some Competitors of Test Based on Powers of Ranks for the Two Sample Problem+Deshpande, J.

During his life, Fisher engaged in vigorous controversy with Karl Pearson, Jerzy Neyman, and W. S. Gosset, to name but a few. After Fisher's death, his family donated his book copyrights and other intellectual and personal material to the University of Adelaide.

Exemplar sampling: Nonrandom methods of selecting a sample which characterizes a finite multivariate population,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313005X42886,MAY 2005,13,3,"An exemplar sample is a small subset of a dataset that forms a characterization of the dataset and can also be used as a list of targets for further inspection. Traditionally exemplars are encountered in cluster analysis techniques such as k-medoids, where each exemplar represents a different cluster. This article extends the concept of exemplar sampling by constructing four criteria for choosing a sample: similarity, distinctness, exhaustiveness, and typicalness. Each criterion illustrates a different way of characterizing the dataset. We describe an adapted version of the CLARANS algorithm which can be used to efficiently draw exemplar samples, and show some examples on test datasets. Exemplar sampling is proposed for use in finite population inference, as an alternative to methods such as stratification or balancing.","balanced sample,cluster analysis,data mining,information-rich cases,model-based estimation,nonprobability sampling,representative sample",,"Bull, B@Datamine Ltd, Wellington, New Zealand","Bull, B@Unknow",not exist,"no title+Cochran, W.

Randomization to treatment conditions can be done at the cluster level or at the person level within each cluster. The latter may result in control group contamination, and cluster randomization is therefore often preferred in practice. This article models the control group contamination, calculates the required sample sizes for both levels of randomization, and gives the degree of contamination for which cluster randomization is preferable above randomization of persons within clusters. Moreover, it provides examples of situations where one has to make a choice between both levels of randomization.","experimental design,intervention study,intra-cluster correlation coefficient,nested data,relative efficiency","PREVENTION TRIAL,DESIGN,CONTAMINATION,INTERVENTION,MODELS","Moerbeek, M@Univ Utrecht, Dept Methodol & Stat, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands","Moerbeek, M@Utrecht University",not exist,"Short-term effects of a Randomized computer-based out-of-school smoking prevention trial aimed at elementary schoolchildren+Ausems, M; Mesters, I; van Breukelen, G; et al.+PREVENTIVE MEDICINE+JUN 2002::RUFLOXACIN ONCE-DAILY VERSUS CIPROFLOXACIN TWICE-DAILY IN THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH ACUTE UNCOMPLICATED PYELONEPHRITIS+BACH, D; VANDENBERGSEGERS, A; HUBNER, A; et al.+JOURNAL OF UROLOGY+JUL 1995::The NIMH multisite HIV prevention trial: Reducing HIV sexual risk behavior+Celentano, DD; Dilorio, C; Hartwell, T; et al.+SCIENCE+JUN 19 1998::Diffusion effects: Control group contamination threats to the validity of teacher-administered interventions+Craven, RG; Marsh, HW; Debus, RL; et al.+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY+SEP 2001::METHODS FOR COMPARING EVENT RATES IN INTERVENTION STUDIES WHEN THE UNIT OF ALLOCATION IS A CLUSTER+DONNER, A; KLAR, N+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+AUG 1 1994::RANDOMIZATION BY CLUSTER - SAMPLE-SIZE REQUIREMENTS AND ANALYSIS+DONNER, A; BIRKETT, N; BUCK, C+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+1981::On design considerations and randomization-based inference for community intervention trials+Gail, MH; Mark, SD; Carroll, RJ; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUN 15 1996::no title+Goldstein, H.+Multilevel Statistical Models+1995::MULTISITE EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING-PROGRAM EVALUATIONS - A TALE OF 3 STUDIES+GREENBERG, D; MEYER, RH; WISEMAN, M+INDUSTRIAL &amp; LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW+JUL 1994::ANALYSIS OF CLUSTERED DATA IN COMMUNITY PSYCHOLOGY - WITH AN EXAMPLE FROM A WORKSITE SMOKING CESSATION PROJECT+HEDEKER, D; MCMAHON, SD; JASON, LA; et al.+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY PSYCHOLOGY+OCT 1994::RANDOM REGRESSION-MODELS FOR MULTICENTER CLINICAL-TRIALS DATA+HEDEKER, D; GIBBONS, RD; DAVIS, JM+PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY BULLETIN+1991::Randomization of clusters versus randomization of persons within clusters: Which is preferable?+Moerbeek, M+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+FEB 2005::Optimal experimental designs for multilevel models with covariates+Moerbeek, M; Van Breukelen, GJP; Berger, MPF+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2001::A multilevel perspective on the design and analysis of intervention studies+Plewis, I.; Hurry, J.+Educational Research and Evaluation+1998::Statistical power and optimal design for multisite randomized trials+Raudenbush, SW; Liu, XF+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+JUN 2000::Cluster versus individual randomization in adolescent tobacco and alcohol studies: Illustrations for design decisions+Slymen, DJ; Hovell, MF+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+AUG 1997::IMPACT OF VITAMIN-A SUPPLEMENTATION ON CHILDHOOD MORTALITY - A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED COMMUNITY TRIAL+SOMMER, A; DJUNAEDI, E; LOEDEN, AA; et al.+LANCET+MAY 24 1986::Contamination in trials: is cluster randomisation the answer?+Torgerson, DJ+BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL+FEB 10 2001"
Making babies by the flip of a coin?,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313005X42813,MAY 2005,6,7,"Many probability and genetics textbooks pose standard questions about eye color, birth defects, sexes of children, and so on. Solutions to these questions, specifically about sexes, generally make two assumptions: first, that a randomly selected embryo is equally likely to be male or female; second, that the sexes of successive children from the same parents are independent. In other words, probabilists (and some geneticists) treat sexes of children like flips of a fair coin: two possible outcomes, each equally likely, with outcomes independent from trial to trial. But are these assumptions realistic? Demographic data suggest that neither a balance of sexes nor true independence exist in nature. Yet most textbooks, both in genetics and probability theory, continue to use the binomial distribution as an acceptable approximation for solving genetics problems involving live-birth sex ratios in species where sex is determined by an XX versus XY chromosome mechanism. We look at a widely circulated article in Parade magazine regarding the gender distribution in human families with two children and analyze comparable data from federal sources to show that such families do not conform to any binomial distribution. The sequence of investigations we take here could be followed in an introductory or intermediate probability and statistics course.","binomial model,chi-square test,genetics,gender,probability",,"Carlton, MA@Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Dept Stat, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA@Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Dept Biol, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA::Stansfield, WD@Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Dept Stat, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA@Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Dept Biol, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA","Carlton, MA@California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo@California State University System@California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo@California State University System::Stansfield, WD@California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo@California State University System@California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo@California State University System",not exist,"Surfactant protein secreted by the maturing mouse fetal lung acts as a hormone that signals the initiation of parturition+Condon, JC; Jeyasuria, P; Faust, JM; et al.+PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA+APR 6 2004::no title+Degroot,, M.

This article provides background and raises issues to keep in mind when reading the program descriptions in the articles that follow. Changing our understanding of what constitutes effective pedagogy, improving the use of technology, and placing an emphasis on working with data in elementary courses raise the standard that teaching assistants must meet. Many graduate students come from countries with cultures and education systems quite different from those in the United States.

Statistical practice - Detecting bias in jury selection,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313007X243629,NOV 2007,10,5,"The process of jury selection typically requires opposing counsel to reduce a pool of prospective jurors to the prescribed jury size by alternately excusing or striking individuals from service. These decisions, called peremptory strikes, are executed without the need of revealing any underlying rationale. However, recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have held that attorneys may not exercise their peremptory strikes to systematically exclude prospective jurors on the basis of race or gender. The first step in establishing a charge of such improper bias requires the challenging party to show evidence that his or her opponent's strikes are inconsistent with random consideration of these protected characteristics. Since court procedure dictates that there is some alternating between Prosecution and Defense in the striking process, choices for each side impact those of the other, and a simple comparison of the jury pool with the peremptory strikes is insufficient for establishing any inference of bias. For these situations, we present a methodology for assessing the neutrality of juror strikes, based on the Poisson binomial distribution.","batson challenge,peremptory strikes,Poisson binomial distribution","PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES,TRIALS","Barrett, Bruce E.@Univ Alabama, Dept Informat Syst & Stat, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA","Barrett, Bruce E.@University of Alabama Tuscaloosa@University of Alabama System",not exist,"The use of confidence or fiducial limits illustrated in the case of the binomial.+Clopper, CJ; Pearson, ES+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1934::no title+FINKELSTEIN MO+CHANCE+2004::Clear choices and guesswork in peremptory challenges in federal criminal trials+Finkelstein, MO; Levin, B+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1997::no title+Finkelstein, MO.+Quantitative methods in law+1978::Bayes' Theorem, Binominal Probabilities, and Fair Numbers of Peremptory Challenges in Jury Trials+Franklin, L.

Modeling and simulation to adjust p values in presence of a regression to the mean effect,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313007X245023,NOV 2007,15,5,"Exploratory analysis methods, such as data mining, make it more common than ever to analyze data in a retrospective fashion, for example, to detect subgroups of interest. Such post-hoc approaches can easily be misleading, with an ""effect"" being found that is nothing more than an artifact of the data. One reason for such a finding-which is actually nonexistent-can be the well-known phenomenon of regression to the mean. It poses a challenge that, if ignored, can generate incorrect claims of significance.

This article summarizes the characteristics of regression to the mean and proposes an often easily implemented general approach to adjust such findings for potential confounding effects. The approach relies on the derivation of a reference distribution for calculated p values, based on modeling and simulation. The methodology allows for complex models to be used, because the simulations do not require that one works out the correlation structure of the parameter estimates analytically to adjust the regression to the mean effect. It also allows for a straightforward assessment of the goodness of the fit, following the idea of posterior predictive checks.

We illustrate the approach with the adjustment of the result from a recent study on patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease for which an unplanned subgroup selection was used after study completion.","modeling,p value adjustment,posterior predictive check,retrospective analysis,simulation,subgroup analysis","ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE,SAMPLES SUBJECT,RIVASTIGMINE,EFFICACY","Krause, Andreas@Pharsight Corp, Strateg Consulting Serv, Mountain View, CA 94041 USA@Novartis Pharma AG, Modeling & Simulat Grp, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland::Pinheiro, Jose@Pharsight Corp, Strateg Consulting Serv, Mountain View, CA 94041 USA@Novartis Pharma AG, Modeling & Simulat Grp, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland","Krause, Andreas@Unknow@Novartis::Pinheiro, Jose@Unknow@Novartis",not exist,"Regression to the mean: what it is and how to deal with it+Barnett, AG; van der Pols, JC; Dobson, AJ+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+FEB 2005::A more flexible regression-to-the-mean model with possible stratification+Chen, SD; Cox, C; Cui, L+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1998::A randomized trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENA 713 (rivastigmine tartrate), a new acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, in patients with mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's disease+Corey-Bloom, J.; Anand, R.; Veach, J.+Int.

The most typical characteristic of survival data is incompleteness, where by far the most common models are those of censoring and truncation. Although quite different in nature, the left truncation and the right censoring models result in nonparametric estimates which are very similar in form. However, in other models of truncation and censoring this similarity breaks and estimation should be based on the special properties of each type of incompleteness. This note contrasts two simple models, one of censoring with a known censoring distribution and the other of truncation with a known truncation distribution. The goal is to highlight the differences between the two types of incomplete data in a way that can help analyze and interpret more complicated survival data.","censored data,selection bias,survival analysis,truncated data",,"Mandel, Micha@Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Stat, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel","Mandel, Micha@Hebrew University of Jerusalem",not exist,"The product-limit estimate as an inverse-probability-weighted average+Shen, PS+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2003::Survival of critically ill patients hospitalized in and out of intensive care+Simchen, Elisheva; Sprung, Charles L.; Galai, Noya; et al.+CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE+FEB 2006::EMPIRICAL DISTRIBUTIONS IN SELECTION BIAS MODELS+VARDI, Y+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1985"
The bagged median and the bragged mean,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313007X245407,NOV 2007,14,0,"Bagging (bootstrap aggregating) is a procedure that aims at reducing the prediction error of a classifier or the mean square error of an estimate by averaging its values across bootstrap samples. We illustrate some of the effects of bagging on point estimation using only averages and medians. Our examples show that when we compute the bagged version of a robust estimate, the size of the bootstrap samples can be viewed as a tuning constant that controls the trade-off between efficiency and robustness. To quantify the robustness properties of bagged estimates we introduce a new concept of breakdown point that is useful in situations when resampling is needed. Finally, a robust version of bagging applied to the average leads to generalizations of previous results about the Hodges-Lehmann estimate.","bagging,bootstrap,breakdown point,Hodges-Lehmann estimate,robustness","STATISTICS,ESTIMATORS","Berrendero, Jose R.@Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Matemat, E-28049 Madrid, Spain","Berrendero, Jose R.@Autonomous University of Madrid",not exist,"Bagging predictors+Breiman, L+MACHINE LEARNING+AUG 1996::Analyzing bagging+Buhlmann, P; Yu, B+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+AUG 2002::Bagging, boosting and ensemble methods+Buhlmann, P+HANDBOOK OF COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS: CONCEPTS AND METHODS+2004::Observations on bagging+Buja, A; Stuetzle, W+STATISTICA SINICA+APR 2006::Effects of bagging and bias correction on estimators defined by estimating equations+Chen, SX; Hall, P+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 2003::Stochastic orders and majorization of mean order statistics+De la Cal, Jesus; Carcamo, Javier+JOURNAL OF APPLIED PROBABILITY+SEP 2006::1977 RIETZ LECTURE - BOOTSTRAP METHODS - ANOTHER LOOK AT THE JACKKNIFE+EFRON, B+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1979::ON THE LIMITING BEHAVIOR OF THE MODE AND MEDIAN OF A SUM OF INDEPENDENT RANDOM-VARIABLES+HALL, P+ANNALS OF PROBABILITY+1980::A NEW DISTRIBUTION-FREE QUANTILE ESTIMATOR+HARRELL, FE; DAVIS, CE+BIOMETRIKA+1982::no title+Huber, P.

Starting from these bounds we define a dataset to contain outside values if at least one of the latter bounds is outside of the box. This leads to a new, yet simple definition of fences. They are symmetric around the box if, and only if, the median is in the middle of the box. In that case, the new definition coincides with Tukey's rule of 1.5 times the inter quartile range. To avoid instabilities for small (sub-) samples we propose to complement the box-and-whiskers plot of the original data with a box-and-whiskers plot of Walsh means.","box plots,mean,quartiles,robustness,stability,Walsh means",,"Duambgen, Lutz@Univ Bern, Inst Math Stat & Actuarial Sci, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland::Riedwyl, Hans@Univ Bern, Inst Math Stat & Actuarial Sci, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland","Duambgen, Lutz@University of Bern::Riedwyl, Hans@University of Bern",not exist,"SOME IMPLEMENTATIONS OF THE BOXPLOT+FRIGGE, M; HOAGLIN, DC; IGLEWICZ, B+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+FEB 1989::no title+HESS MW+NATURE+1967::ESTIMATES OF LOCATION BASED ON RANK-TESTS+HODGES, JL; LEHMANN, EL+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1963::Exploratory data analysis for possibly censored data from skewed distribution+Kimber, A.

By a simple fraction we mean a fraction that, when put in lowest terms, has a small denominator. After discussing the history of Bayesian inference on a proportion, we propose a class of otherwise noninformative priors that incorporates the idea that the proportion is likely to be a simple fraction, and we explore the impact of the choice of parameter. We propose the posterior mode as a point estimator, and we study the behavior of this estimator both asymptotically and for small sample sizes. We illustrate our approach by applying it both to the famous problem of estimating the probability that the sun will rise again tomorrow and to examples from the scientific work of the Augustinian friar Gregor Mendel.","Gregor Mendel,Harold Jeffreys,noninformative priors,simplicity postulate",,"Frey, Jesse@Villanova Univ, Dept Math Sci, Villanova, PA 19085 USA","Frey, Jesse@Villanova University",not exist,"Approximate is better than ""exact"" for interval estimation of binomial proportions+Agresti, A; Coull, BA+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1998::An essay towards solving a problem in the doctrine of chances+Bayes, T.+Phil Trans+1763::no title+Berger,, J.+Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis+1985::no title+Fisher, R.

Sample size estimates using the evidential paradigm, illustrated with an example for Gaussian response data, are compared to those obtained using NP methodology. A relation between the error probabilities of the two paradigms is derived.

Whitworth discovered the famous Kelly formula for proportionate betting as put forth in a recent note by Szekely and Richards.

A ""fair"" valuation was one that would yield zero capital growth, that is, a geometric mean return of zero. In contrast, the Kelly criterion seeks a fixed proportion of a gambler's wealth that should be wagered to maximize capital growth.

Simple state-space models in a mixed model framework,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313007X220426,AUG 2007,22,12,"State-space models play a central role in time series analysis. Biological time series, which present trend, seasonal, and cyclic fluctuations, can be well described by such models. In addition, biological experiments and surveys often have a relatively complex design structure calling for special attention. It is straightforward to account for design effects in a mixed linear model framework. This article shows how simple state-space models can be cast as a standard mixed model, provided the transition matrix of the state equation has a simple form. This opens up the opportunity for refined modeling of time series data involving complex blocking and treatment structures. Conversely, the state-space model gives rise to a special class of variance-covariance structures. Thus, integrating state-space components into a mixed model broadens the class of variance-covariance structures that may be employed to model serial correlation in longitudinal data. The approach is illustrated using several biological examples.","best linear unbiased prediction,basic structural model,generalized linear mixed model,Kalman filter,longitudinal data,random walk,restricted maximum likelihood,time series","FIELD EXPERIMENTS,LIKELIHOOD,INFERENCE,DYNAMICS","Piepho, Hans-Peter@Univ Hohenheim, Fachgebiet Bioinformat, Inst Pflanzenbau & Gunland, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany@Int Livestock Res Inst, Nairobi, Kenya::Ogutu, Joseph Ochieng@Univ Hohenheim, Fachgebiet Bioinformat, Inst Pflanzenbau & Gunland, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany@Int Livestock Res Inst, Nairobi, Kenya","Piepho, Hans-Peter@University Hohenheim@International Livestock Research Institute::Ogutu, Joseph Ochieng@University Hohenheim@International Livestock Research Institute","Ogutu, Joseph O@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7379-0387::Piepho, Hans-Peter@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7813-2992","STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS OF FIELD EXPERIMENTS USING NEIGHBORING PLOTS+BESAG, J; KEMPTON, R+BIOMETRICS+JUN 1986::Bayesian analysis of agricultural field experiments+Besag, J; Higdon, D+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1999::State-space models for the dynamics of wild animal populations+Buckland, ST; Newman, KB; Thomas, L; et al.+ECOLOGICAL MODELLING+JAN 1 2004::Cheese production potential of milk of Dahlem Cashmere goats from a rheological point of view+Dimassi, O; Neidhart, S; Carle, R; et al.+SMALL RUMINANT RESEARCH+FEB 2005::no title+Durbin, J.; Koopman, S.

As an alternative, we propose estimating the median regression parameters via Gaussian estimating equations after applying a Box-Cox transformation to both the outcome and the linear predictor.

The article discusses features of Table SALT as well as its use in the subcommittee's analysis of data.","categorical data,exploratory data analysis,multiway table,strategic plan",,"Schenker, Nathaniel@Univ Maryland, Joint Program Survey Methodol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA@Rho Inc, Massachusetts Off, Newton, MA 02459 USA@Mt Holyoke Coll, Dept Math & Stat, S Hadley, MA 01075 USA@US Gen Accounting Off, Washington, DC 20548 USA@Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Prevent Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA::Monti, Katherine L.@Univ Maryland, Joint Program Survey Methodol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA@Rho Inc, Massachusetts Off, Newton, MA 02459 USA@Mt Holyoke Coll, Dept Math & Stat, S Hadley, MA 01075 USA@US Gen Accounting Off, Washington, DC 20548 USA@Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Prevent Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA::Cobb, George W.@Univ Maryland, Joint Program Survey Methodol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA@Rho Inc, Massachusetts Off, Newton, MA 02459 USA@Mt Holyoke Coll, Dept Math & Stat, S Hadley, MA 01075 USA@US Gen Accounting Off, Washington, DC 20548 USA@Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Prevent Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA::Fecso, Ronald S.@Univ Maryland, Joint Program Survey Methodol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA@Rho Inc, Massachusetts Off, Newton, MA 02459 USA@Mt Holyoke Coll, Dept Math & Stat, S Hadley, MA 01075 USA@US Gen Accounting Off, Washington, DC 20548 USA@Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Prevent Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA::Chmiel, Joan S.@Univ Maryland, Joint Program Survey Methodol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA@Rho Inc, Massachusetts Off, Newton, MA 02459 USA@Mt Holyoke Coll, Dept Math & Stat, S Hadley, MA 01075 USA@US Gen Accounting Off, Washington, DC 20548 USA@Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Prevent Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA","Schenker, Nathaniel@University System of Maryland@University of Maryland College Park@Unknow@Mount Holyoke College@Unknow@Northwestern University@Feinberg School of Medicine::Monti, Katherine L.@University System of Maryland@University of Maryland College Park@Unknow@Mount Holyoke College@Unknow@Northwestern University@Feinberg School of Medicine::Cobb, George W.@University System of Maryland@University of Maryland College Park@Unknow@Mount Holyoke College@Unknow@Northwestern University@Feinberg School of Medicine::Fecso, Ronald S.@University System of Maryland@University of Maryland College Park@Unknow@Mount Holyoke College@Unknow@Northwestern University@Feinberg School of Medicine::Chmiel, Joan S.@University System of Maryland@University of Maryland College Park@Unknow@Mount Holyoke College@Unknow@Northwestern University@Feinberg School of Medicine",not exist,"Promoting statistical thinking among secondary school students in the national context+Boland, PJ+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 2003::AN EXAMPLE OF USE OF GRAPHICS IN REGRESSION+DENBY, L; PREGIBON, D+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+FEB 1987::Stem-and-leaf displays+Emerson, J.

Quantum random bit generators,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313007X223225,AUG 2007,38,2,The importance of random number generators has increased over the years. This follows from the fact that contemporary research methods rely more and more on simulation and the increased importance of encryption technology. The output of a random number generator is created by either an algorithm or a physical device. The most popular method for random number generation is through the use of an algorithm. This article presents a new category of physical random bit generator that is packaged by several manufacturers.

Is an .833 hitter better than a .338 hitter?,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313007X192437,MAY 2007,10,1,"This article considers the problem Of using batting average alone to estimatea baseball player's chance of getting a hit. This problem differs from typical proportion estimation problems because we know only the observed proportion of successes rather than both the number of successes and the number of trials. Our information is also restricted because the observed proportion of successes is reported to only three decimal places. We solve this problem in the context of present-day major league baseball by first developing a model for the joint distribution of hits, at bats, and chance of getting a hit. We then treat that model as a prior distribution and update the prior based on the observed batting average. One interesting result is that among batting averages likely to occur in practice, .334 leads to the highest posterior mean for true ability.","baseball,batting average,Bayesian methods",MODEL,"Frey, Jesse@Villanova Univ, Dept Math Sci, Villanova, PA 19085 USA","Frey, Jesse@Villanova University",not exist,"A STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS OF HITTING STREAKS IN BASEBALL+ALBRIGHT, SC+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1993::no title+Berger,, J.+Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis+1985::Bridging different eras in sports+Berry, SM; Reese, CS; Larkey, PD+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1999::ESTIMATION WITH SELECTED BINOMIAL INFORMATION OR DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT WINFIELD,DAVE IS BATTING .471+CASELLA, G; BERGER, RL+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1994::ROBUST LOCALLY WEIGHTED REGRESSION AND SMOOTHING SCATTERPLOTS+CLEVELAND, WS+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1979::DATA-ANALYSIS USING STEINS ESTIMATOR AND ITS GENERALIZATIONS+EFRON, B; MORRIS, C+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1975::USE OF A CORRELATED BINOMIAL MODEL FOR ANALYSIS OF CERTAIN TOXICOLOGICAL EXPERIMENTS+KUPPER, LL; HASEMAN, JK+BIOMETRICS+1978::no title+LAHMAN S+LAHMAN BASEBALL DATA+2004::no title+Lewis, M.+Moneyball: the art of winning an unfair game+2003::A MARKOV-CHAIN MODEL OF EXTRABINOMIAL VARIATION+RUDOLFER, SM+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1990"

In retrospect it is perhaps now obvious that standard stochastic sampling algorithms were destined to fail when applied to the type of models that these data require. During this period, both the genetics and statistics research communities have developed a range of new algorithms that have endeavored to avoid these failures. This article presents a brief journey through the development of some of these algorithms. I hope to demonstrate that continued collaborative research and education in both genetics and statistics disciplines is crucial for the advancement of future sampling frameworks, and call on researchers in both fields to take up this challenge.","approximate Bayesian computation,Markov chain Monte Carlo,population genetics,reversible jump,simulated tempering,statistical genetics","CHAIN MONTE-CARLO,APPROXIMATE BAYESIAN COMPUTATION,MARKOV-CHAIN,PEDIGREE DATA,INFERENCE,CONSTRUCTION,LIKELIHOODS","Sisson, S.

Specifically, we assess accuracy rates for median decision procedures used in the radiological diagnosis of asbestosis. Conditional exchangeability of individual radiologists' diagnoses is recognized as more appropriate than independence which is commonly presumed. The FTP yields coherent bounds on probabilities of interest when available information is insufficient to determine a complete distribution. Further assertions that are natural to the problem motivate a partial ordering of conditional probabilities, extending the computation from a linear to a quadratic programming problem.","asbestosis,coherence,exchangeability,fundamental theorem of prevision,linear programming,medical diagnosis,predictive values,probability bounds,quadratic programming,second opinions,sensitivity,specificity",,"Capotorti, Andrea@Univ Perugia, Dept Math & Comp Sci, I-06123 Perugia, Italy@Univ Canterbury, Dept Math & Stat, Christchurch 8020, New Zealand@Univ Palermo, Dept Stat & Math S Vianelli, I-90128 Palermo, Italy::Lad, Frank@Univ Perugia, Dept Math & Comp Sci, I-06123 Perugia, Italy@Univ Canterbury, Dept Math & Stat, Christchurch 8020, New Zealand@Univ Palermo, Dept Stat & Math S Vianelli, I-90128 Palermo, Italy::Sanfilippo, Giuseppe@Univ Perugia, Dept Math & Comp Sci, I-06123 Perugia, Italy@Univ Canterbury, Dept Math & Stat, Christchurch 8020, New Zealand@Univ Palermo, Dept Stat & Math S Vianelli, I-90128 Palermo, Italy","Capotorti, Andrea@University of Perugia@University of Canterbury@University of Palermo - Italy::Lad, Frank@University of Perugia@University of Canterbury@University of Palermo - Italy::Sanfilippo, Giuseppe@University of Perugia@University of Canterbury@University of Palermo - Italy","Sanfilippo, Giuseppe@F-8711-2011@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0657-3833::Capotorti, Andrea@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1337-8315","no title+Brooke, A.; Kendrick, D.; Meeraus, A.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Raman, R</span>.+GAMS.

This article grounds kappa-type indices in statistical modeling, making explicit the underlying premises and assumptions. We critically review whether the interpretation of the kappa index as a chance-corrected probability of agreement can be substantiated. Further, we show that the so-called paradoxical behavior of the kappa index is explained from the fact that it is a measure of predictive association, rather than a pure measure of reproducibility. We discuss a number of alternative forms, critically examining whether they can be translated in tangible real-life interpretations.","categorical data,gauge capability analysis,measurement system analysis,nominal data,reliability,reproducibility","COEFFICIENT,RATERS","De Mast, Jeroen@Univ Amsterdam, NL-1018 TV Amsterdam, Netherlands","De Mast, Jeroen@University of Amsterdam","De Mast, Jeroen@A-6836-2011","no title+Allen, M.J; Yen, W.M.+Introduction to measurement theory+1979::Communications through limited questioning+Bennett, E.

The word ""statistics"" originated in eighteenth century Germany, its science, however, originated long before that. In this article we present some early clues of application of statistical principles on medicine from the Roman era, which, albeit rudimentary, contain many modern basic principles of statistics, like the concepts of sample size, mean, distribution of population, representativeness and randomization of the sample. Most clues come from Galen's writings and are probably cited for the first time with a statistical point of view.

"Likelihood ratio, score, and Wald tests in a constrained parameter space",AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313007X171322,FEB 2007,32,70,"Likelihood ratio, score, and Wald tests statistics are asymptotically equivalent. This statement is widely known to hold true under standard conditions. But what if the parameter space is constrained and the null hypothesis lies on the boundary of the parameter space, such as, for example, in variance component testing? Quite a bit is known in such situations too, but knowledge is scattered across the literature and considerably less well known among practitioners. Motivated from simple but generic examples, we show there is quite a market for asymptotic one-sided hypothesis tests, in the scalar as well as in the vector case. Reassuringly, the three standard tests can be used here as well and are asymptotically equivalent, but a somewhat more elaborate version of the score and Wald test statistics is needed. Null distributions take the form of mixtures of chi(2) distributions. Statistical and numerical considerations lead us to formulate pragmatic guidelines as to when to prefer which of the three tests.","boundary condition,dose response,generalized linear mixed model,likelihood ratio test,linear mixed model,one-sided test,score test,variance component,Wald test","GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,REGRESSION PARAMETERS,VARIANCE-COMPONENTS,OVERDISPERSION,HOMOGENEITY","Molenberghs, Geert@Hasselt Univ, Ctr Stat, Diepenbeek, Belgium@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Biostat, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium::Verbeke, Geert@Hasselt Univ, Ctr Stat, Diepenbeek, Belgium@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Biostat, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium","Molenberghs, Geert@Hasselt University@KU Leuven::Verbeke, Geert@Hasselt University@KU Leuven","Verbeke, Geert@I-5587-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8430-7576","no title+Aerts, M.; Geys, H.; Molenberghs, G.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Ryan, L</span>.+Topics in Modelling of Clustered Data+2002::Tests to detect clustering of infected individuals within families+Britton, T+BIOMETRICS+MAR 1997::SOME REMARKS ON OVERDISPERSION+COX, DR+BIOMETRIKA+1983::The distribution of a linear combination of chi2 random variables+Davies, R.+Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series C: Applied Statistics+1980::A 12-week treatment for dermatophyte toe onychomycosis: Terbinafine 250 mg/day vs, itraconazole 200 mg/day - A double-blind comparative trial+DeBacker, M; DeKeyser, P; DeVroey, C; et al.+BRITISH JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY+JUN 1996::Behaviour of the likelihood ratio test statistic under a Bahadur model for exchangeable binary data+Declerck, L; Aerts, M; Molenberghs, G+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+1998::no title+Dykstra, R.

Characterizing density crossing points,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313007X171304,FEB 2007,6,5,"This article addresses the following question: Where and how often do distinct probability density functions cross? For example, what can be said about crossing points between normal and Student's t or chi-square densities, respectively, and what are the asymptotic crossing points if the degrees of freedom tend to infinity? Crossing points are especially of interest if, for instance, the normal is used as an approximation according to the central limit theorem because they determine the total variation distance and the areas of over- and underestimation of actual probabilities. They are strongly related to the behavior of the density ratio, a ubiquitous quantity in many fields of statistics like Neyman-Pearson or decision theory. We discuss several examples with respect to the standard normal density phi and provide elegant and appealing limiting forms for asymptotic crossing points of v with respect to densities of standardized sums appearing in the central limit theorem. Finally, we derive and investigate the crossing points of phi with the t-density with nu degrees of freedom.","chi-square distribution,implicit function theorem,gamma distribution,local limit theorem,monotone likelihood ratio,variation diminishing transformation",,"Finner, Helmut@Univ Dusseldorf, Leibniz Ctr, German Diabet Ctr, Inst Biometr & Epidemiol, D-4000 Dusseldorf, Germany@Omnicare Clin Res, Biometr Dept, Cologne, Germany::Roters, Markus@Univ Dusseldorf, Leibniz Ctr, German Diabet Ctr, Inst Biometr & Epidemiol, D-4000 Dusseldorf, Germany@Omnicare Clin Res, Biometr Dept, Cologne, Germany::Dickhaus, Thorsten@Univ Dusseldorf, Leibniz Ctr, German Diabet Ctr, Inst Biometr & Epidemiol, D-4000 Dusseldorf, Germany@Omnicare Clin Res, Biometr Dept, Cologne, Germany","Finner, Helmut@Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf@Deutsches Diabetes-Zentrum (DDZ)@Unknow::Roters, Markus@Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf@Deutsches Diabetes-Zentrum (DDZ)@Unknow::Dickhaus, Thorsten@Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf@Deutsches Diabetes-Zentrum (DDZ)@Unknow","Dickhaus, Thorsten@I-3571-2012","no title+Abramowitz, M.; Stegun, I.

Linear transformations and the k-means clustering algorithm: Applications to clustering curves,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313007X171016,FEB 2007,25,37,Functional data can be clustered by plugging estimated regression coefficients from individual curves into the k-means algorithm. Clustering results can differ depending on how the curves are fit to the data. Estimating curves using different sets of basis functions corresponds to different linear transformations of the data. k-means clustering is not invariant to linear transformations of the data. The optimal linear transformation for clustering will stretch the distribution so that the primary direction of variability aligns with actual differences in the clusters. It is shown that clustering the raw data will often give results similar to clustering regression coefficients obtained using an orthogonal design matrix. Clustering functional data using an L-2 metric on function space can be achieved by clustering a suitable linear transformation of the regression coefficients.

The use of statistics in medical research: A comparison of The New England Journal of Medicine and Nature Medicine,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313007X170242,FEB 2007,45,41,"There is widespread evidence of the extensive use of statistical methods in medical research. Just the same, standards are generally low and a growing body of literature points to statistical errors in most medical journals. However, there is no comprehensive study contrasting the top medical journals of basic and clinical science for recent practice in their use of statistics.

All original research articles in Volume 10, Numbers 1-6 of Nature Medicine (Nat Med) and Volume 350, Numbers 1-26 of The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) were screened for their statistical content. Types, frequencies, and complexity of applied statistical methods were systematically recorded. A 46-item checklist was used to evaluate statistical quality for a subgroup of papers.

94.5 percent (95% CI 87.6-98.2) of NEJM articles and 82.4 percent (95% CI 65.5-93.2) of Nat Med articles contained inferential statistics. NEJM papers were significantly more likely to use advanced statistical methods (p < 0.0001). Statistical errors were identified in a considerable proportion of articles, although not always serious in nature. Documentation of applied statistical methods was generally poor and insufficient, particularly in Nat Med.

Compared to 1983, a vast increase in usage and complexity of statistical methods could be observed for NEJM papers. This does not necessarily hold true for Nat Med papers, as the results of the study indicate that basic science sticks with basic analysis. As statistical errors seem to remain common in medical literature. closer attention to statistical methodology should be seriously considered to raise standards.","complexity,errors and shortcomings,statistical methods in medical journals,techniques","MISUSE,QUALITY,ARTICLES,MANUSCRIPTS,PSYCHIATRY,ANESTHESIA,CONFIDENCE,TRIALS,ERRORS","Strasak, Alexander M.@Innsbruck Med Univ, Dept Med Stat Informat & Hlth Econ, Innsbruck, Austria@Univ Innsbruck, Fac Econ & Stat, Dept Stat, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria::Zaman, Qamruz@Innsbruck Med Univ, Dept Med Stat Informat & Hlth Econ, Innsbruck, Austria@Univ Innsbruck, Fac Econ & Stat, Dept Stat, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria::Marinell, Gerhard@Innsbruck Med Univ, Dept Med Stat Informat & Hlth Econ, Innsbruck, Austria@Univ Innsbruck, Fac Econ & Stat, Dept Stat, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria::Pfeiffer, Karl P.@Innsbruck Med Univ, Dept Med Stat Informat & Hlth Econ, Innsbruck, Austria@Univ Innsbruck, Fac Econ & Stat, Dept Stat, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria::Ulmer, Hanno@Innsbruck Med Univ, Dept Med Stat Informat & Hlth Econ, Innsbruck, Austria@Univ Innsbruck, Fac Econ & Stat, Dept Stat, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria","Strasak, Alexander M.@Medical University of Innsbruck@University of Innsbruck::Zaman, Qamruz@Medical University of Innsbruck@University of Innsbruck::Marinell, Gerhard@Medical University of Innsbruck@University of Innsbruck::Pfeiffer, Karl P.@Medical University of Innsbruck@University of Innsbruck::Ulmer, Hanno@Medical University of Innsbruck@University of Innsbruck","Ulmer, Hanno@C-3488-2011@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5911-1002","Statistics in medical journals.+Altman, D G+Statistics in medicine+1982 Jan-Mar::STATISTICAL GUIDELINES FOR CONTRIBUTORS TO MEDICAL JOURNALS+ALTMAN, DG; GORE, SM; GARDNER, MJ; et al.+BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL+1983::STATISTICS AND ETHICS IN MEDICAL-RESEARCH .8.

We can find evidence of this difficulty in research articles reporting statistical findings: many analyze the data using simple random sampling assumptions even though a cluster sample was actually taken. We review several statistics texts' treatment of sampling assumptions for confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. We then propose activities that could be used in the classroom to help students gain a better understanding of the concepts of simple random sampling and confidence intervals.","cluster sample,confidence interval,pseudoreplication,simple random sample,statistical education",DESIGN,"Alf, Cherie@Iowa State Univ, Dept Stat, Ames, IA 50011 USA@Arizona State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA::Lohr, Sharon@Iowa State Univ, Dept Stat, Ames, IA 50011 USA@Arizona State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Alf, Cherie@Iowa State University@Arizona State University::Lohr, Sharon@Iowa State University@Arizona State University",not exist,"no title+Agresti, A.; Franklin, C.+Statistics: the Art and Science of Learning from Data+2007::no title+Aliaga, Martha; Gunderson, Brenda.+Interactive Statistics+2006::Reasoning About Sampling Distributions+Chance, B.; dleMas, R.; Garfield, J.+The Challenge of Developing Statistical Literacy, Reasoning and Thinking+2004::Design and analysis of controlled trials in naturally clustered environments: Implications for medical informatics+Chuang, JH; Hripcsak, G; Heitjan, DF+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION+MAY-JUN 2002::no title+Cochran, W.

Much ado about nothing: A comparison of missing data methods and software to fit incomplete data regression models,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313007X172556,FEB 2007,66,327,"Missing data are a recurring problem that can cause bias or lead to inefficient analyses. Statistical methods to address missingness have been actively pursued in recent years, including imputation. likelihood, and weighting approaches. Each approach is more complicated when there are many patterns of missing values. or when both categorical and continuous random variables are involved. Implementations of routines to incorporate observations with incomplete variables in regression models are now widely available. We review these routines in the context of a motivating example from a large health services research dataset. While there are still limitations to the current implementations, and additional efforts are required of the analyst, it is feasible to incorporate partially observed values, and these methods should be used in practice.","conditional Gaussian,health services research,maximum likelihood,multiple imputation,psychiatric epidemiology","GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,MULTIPLE IMPUTATION,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,CLINICAL-TRIALS,MIXTURE-MODELS,ALGORITHM,VARIABLES,OUTCOMES,EM","Horton, Nicholas J.@Smith Coll, Clark Sci Ctr, Dept Math & Stat, Northampton, MA 01063 USA@Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Ambulatory Care & Prevent, Boston, MA USA@Harvard Pilgrim Hlth Care, Boston, MA USA::Kleinman, Ken P.@Smith Coll, Clark Sci Ctr, Dept Math & Stat, Northampton, MA 01063 USA@Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Ambulatory Care & Prevent, Boston, MA USA@Harvard Pilgrim Hlth Care, Boston, MA USA","Horton, Nicholas J.@Smith College@Harvard University@Harvard Pilgrim Health Care::Kleinman, Ken P.@Smith College@Harvard University@Harvard Pilgrim Health Care","Horton, Nicholas@A-2493-2008@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3332-4311::Benneyworth, Brian@A-4667-2009@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4692-5303","no title+Allison, P.+Imputation of Categorical Variables with PROC MI+2005::no title+Allison, P.+Missing data+2002::Multiple imputation for missing data - A cautionary tale+Allison, PD+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS &amp;

Analysis of a pilot study for amelioration of itching in liver disease: When is a failed trial not a failure?,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313006X150551,NOV 2006,15,0,"This article presents an analysis of a small ""failed clinical trial"" that shows how the combination of solid statistical theory and methods and expert collaboration from other disciplines can lead to new areas of research. A double-blind placebo-controlled pilot study of 15 subjects was conducted in order to examine the efficacy of gabapentin in reducing itching and scratching secondary to liver disease. The data from the study contained missing values due to a number of mechanisms. In addition, the measurement instrument produced highly variable data, including large outliers. This article describes how these issues were resolved for this trial in an expedient manner, and particular attention is paid to a modification of nearest-neighbor hot-deck imputation. Although the study results were inconclusive with respect to the efficacy of gabapentin on itching, when they are considered in the light of other known properties of the drug, the outcome points to an exciting new line of inquiry on the role of gabapentin in regulating the placebo effect itself.","autocorrelation,mixed-effects model,medical statistics,pretest-posttest,outliers","NALOXONE INFUSIONS,PRURITUS,CHOLESTASIS","McGee, Monnie@So Methodist Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Dallas, TX 75275 USA@SUNY Downstate Med Ctr, Kings Cty Hosp Ctr, Brooklyn, NY 11203 USA::Bergasa, Nora V.@So Methodist Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Dallas, TX 75275 USA@SUNY Downstate Med Ctr, Kings Cty Hosp Ctr, Brooklyn, NY 11203 USA","McGee, Monnie@Southern Methodist University@State University of New York (SUNY) System@State University of New York (SUNY) Downstate Medical Center::Bergasa, Nora V.@Southern Methodist University@State University of New York (SUNY) System@State University of New York (SUNY) Downstate Medical Center",not exist,"Relationships between measurement of pain using visual analog score and morphine requirements during postoperative intravenous morphine titration+Aubrun, F; Langeron, O; Quesnel, C; et al.+ANESTHESIOLOGY+JUN 2003::Pilot study of bright-light therapy reflected toward the eyes for the pruritus of chronic liver disease+Bergasa, NV; Link, MJ; Keogh, M; et al.+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY+MAY 2001::EFFECTS OF NALOXONE INFUSIONS IN PATIENTS WITH THE PRURITUS OF CHOLESTASIS - A DOUBLE-BLIND, RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL+BERGASA, NV; ALLING, DW; TALBOT, TL; et al.+ANNALS OF INTERNAL MEDICINE+AUG 1 1995::A CONTROLLED TRIAL OF NALOXONE INFUSIONS FOR THE PRURITUS OF CHRONIC CHOLESTASIS+BERGASA, NV; TALBOT, TL; ALLING, DW; et al.+GASTROENTEROLOGY+FEB 1992::no title+BERGASA NV+IN PRESS HEPATOLOGY+no time::Oral nalmefene therapy reduces scratching activity due to the pruritus of cholestasis: A controlled study+Bergasa, NV; Alling, DW; Talbot, TL; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY+SEP 1999::no title+CARPENTER J+EC SOCIAL RES COUNCI+2005::Applying parametric tests to visual analog scores+Hartmannsgruber, MWB; Silverman, DG+ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA+JUL 2000::Reuse of imputed data in microarray analysis increases imputation efficiency+Kim, KY; Kim, BJ; Yi, GS+BMC BIOINFORMATICS+OCT 26 2004::no title+Little, R.

Calibration guidelines challenge outlier practices,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313006X150182,NOV 2006,12,9,"Thromboplastin, a biological agent important to safe clinical management of patients who receive anticoagulant therapy, is obtained by extraction from mammalian tissues. Because of this natural origin, there is wide variation between successive batches. Therefore, a laboratory experiment must be conducted in order to calibrate each new batch of the material against a standard. In its advice on the statistical estimation of the calibration factor, but without presenting reasons or scientific justification, the World Health Organization uses a simple though crude rule on detecting outliers among the experimental data and deleting them. After a general survey of the nature and cause of outliers, this article offers a critical discussion of the principles of identifying and handling them.

The victory of least squares and orthogonality in statistics,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313006X151109,NOV 2006,22,6,"This article gives a short history of the origin of least squares from a geometric perspective. It describes techniques used to deal with contradictory data in the second half of the eighteenth century, and their applications to problems in astronomy and geodesy. It is interesting that analogues of least squares-with maximum deviation and sums of absolute deviations, respectively, replacing sums of squared deviations-preceded least squares, which first appeared publicly in 1805, by 50 years. Geometry-specifically, an inner product being used to produce angles and orthogonality-is offered as the reason for least squares becoming preferable. More generally, we briefly outline how definitions and fundamental results in the general linear model, analysis of variance, conditional probability, independence, sufficiency, and time series can be unified and clarified as deriving from the inner product.","conditional probability,history of statistics,inner product,least squares,sufficiency,time series","PROBABILITY,HISTORY","deLaubenfels, Ralph@Unknow","deLaubenfels, Ralph@Unknow",not exist,"Theory andMethods+Brockwell, P.

"Tell me the method, I'll give you the mean",AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313006X151460,NOV 2006,28,9,"Different procedures underlying the determination of the mean of a set of values impart different weights to these values. Thus, different methods result in different weighted means. In particular, when the weights are directly proportional, or in fact equal, to the (weighted) values, the self-weighted mean is obtained, and when they are inversely proportional to the values, the harmonic mean results. Generally, the former is greater and the latter is smaller than the arithmetic (uniformly weighted) mean. We illustrate cases of sampling procedures and of geometric requirements that give rise to the self-weighted and harmonic means. We call attention to some psychological difficulties and to the didactic value of dealing with cases of differential weighting.","harmonic mean,self-weighted mean,uniformity heuristic,weighted average","UNCERTAINTY,STUDENTS,JUDGMENT","Lann, Avital@Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Stat, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel@Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Psychol, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel@Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Sch Educ, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel::Falk, Ruma@Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Stat, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel@Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Psychol, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel@Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Sch Educ, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel","Lann, Avital@Hebrew University of Jerusalem@Hebrew University of Jerusalem@Hebrew University of Jerusalem::Falk, Ruma@Hebrew University of Jerusalem@Hebrew University of Jerusalem@Hebrew University of Jerusalem",not exist,"College students' conceptions of probability+Albert, JH+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+FEB 2003::no title+ERCOLANO JL+MATH TEACHER+1973::no title+FALK R+CHANCE+2005::A CLOSER LOOK AT THE PROBABILITIES OF THE NOTORIOUS 3 PRISONERS+FALK, R+COGNITION+JUN 1992::no title+Feller, W.+An Introduction to Probability Theory and its Applications+1957::The effect of methods of ascertainment upon the estimation of frequencies+Fisher, RA+ANNALS OF EUGENICS+OCT 1934::Partition priming in judgment under uncertainty+Fox, CR; Rottenstreich, Y+PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE+MAY 2003::no title+Hacking, I.+The emergence of probability+1975::no title+Haight, F.

"The difference between ""significant"" and ""not significant"" is not itself statistically significant",AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313006X152649,NOV 2006,10,271,"It is common to summarize statistical comparisons by declarations of statistical significance or non significance. Here we discuss one problem with such declarations, namely that changes in statistical significance are often not themselves statistically significant. By this, we are not merely making the commonplace observation that any particular threshold is arbitrary-for example, only a small change is required to move an estimate from a 5.1% significance level to 4.9%, thus moving it into statistical significance. Rather, we are pointing out that even large changes in significance levels can correspond to small, nonsignificant changes in the underlying quantities.

The error we describe is conceptually different from other oft-cited problems-that statistical significance is not the same as practical importance, that dichotomization into significant and nonsignificant results encourages the dismissal of observed differences in favor of the usually less interesting null hypothesis of no difference, and that any particular threshold for declaring significance is arbitrary. We are troubled by all of these concerns and do not intend to minimize their importance. Rather, our goal is to bring attention to this additional error of interpretation. We illustrate with a theoretical example and two applied examples. The ubiquity of this statistical error leads us to suggest that Students and practitioners be made more aware that the difference between ""significant"" and ""not significant"" is not itself statistically significant.","hypothesis testing,meta-analysis,pairwise comparison,replication",OLDER BROTHERS,"Gelman, Andrew@Columbia Univ, Dept Stat, New York, NY 10027 USA@Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA@Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Stat, Irvine, CA USA::Stern, Hal@Columbia Univ, Dept Stat, New York, NY 10027 USA@Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA@Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Stat, Irvine, CA USA","Gelman, Andrew@Columbia University@Columbia University@University of California System@University of California Irvine::Stern, Hal@Columbia University@Columbia University@University of California System@University of California Irvine",not exist,"INFLUENCE OF ELECTROMAGNETIC-FIELDS ON THE EFFLUX OF CALCIUM-IONS FROM BRAIN-TISSUE INVITRO - A 3-MODEL ANALYSIS CONSISTENT WITH THE FREQUENCY-RESPONSE UP TO 510 HZ+BLACKMAN, CF; BENANE, SG; ELLIOTT, DJ; et al.+BIOELECTROMAGNETICS+1988::Homosexuality in men and number of older brothers+Blanchard, R; Bogaert, AF+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY+JAN 1996::Biological versus nonbiological older brothers and men's sexual orientation+Bogaert, Anthony F.+PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA+JUL 11 2006::no title+BOWER B+SCI NEWS+2006::no title+BOWER B+SCI NEWS+2006::no title+Gelman, A.; Carlin, J.

In addition to plotting the observed values directly, we make a scatterplot of orthogonal contrasts from the general linear model. This plot contains the same correlation information as the ordinary scatterplot. Therefore, one can interpret how the effects of the various design variables contribute to the correlation coefficient. This idea is also useful in more general cases. Any graphic presentation of the original observations can be accompanied by a corresponding plot of orthogonal contrasts that often will clarify the interpretation.","design of experiments,fractional factorial design,scatterplot,general linear model,partial least squares,principal component analysis",,"Langsrud, Oyvind@Norwegian Food Res Inst, MATFORSK, N-1430 As, Norway","Langsrud, Oyvind@Unknow",not exist,"no title+Box, G.

Calibrated Bayes: A Bayes/frequentist roadmap,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313006X117837,AUG 2006,64,75,"The lack of an agreed inferential basis for statistics makes life ""interesting"" for academic statisticians, but at the price of negative implications for the status of statistics in industry, science, and government. The practice of our discipline will mature only when we can come to a basic agreement about how to apply statistics to real problems. Simple and more general illustrations are given of the negative consequences of the existing schism between frequentists and Bayesians.

An assessment of strengths and weaknesses of the frequentist and Bayes systems of inference suggests that calibrated Bayes-a compromise based on the works of Box, Rubin, and others-captures the strengths of both approaches and provides a roadmap, for future advances. The approach asserts that inferences under a particular model should be Bayesian, but model assessment can and should involve frequentist ideas. This article also discusses some implications of this proposed compromise for the teaching and practice of statistics.","Bayesian statistics,frequentist statistics,likelihood principle,model checking,statistical inference","COMPOSITE NULL MODELS,IMPUTED SURVEY DATA,ISNT EVERYONE,STATISTICAL-INFERENCE,MULTIPLE-IMPUTATION,P-VALUES,FOUNDATIONS","Little, Roderick J.@Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Little, Roderick J.@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan","Little, Roderick@H-2440-2011","EXACT BAYESIAN ANALYSIS OF A 2X2 CONTINGENCY TABLE, AND FISHERS EXACT SIGNIFICANCE TEST+ALTHAM, PME+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1969::no title+BARNETT V+COMP STAT INFERENCE+1973::An essay on the logical foundations of survey sampling I+Basu, D.+Foundations of Statistical Inference+1971::P values for composite null models+Bayarri, MJ; Berger, JO+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2000::Bayesian analysis: A look at today and thoughts of tomorrow+Berger, JO+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2000::REFERENCE POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTIONS FOR BAYESIAN-INFERENCE+BERNARDO, JM+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1979::ON FOUNDATIONS OF STATISTICAL-INFERENCE+BIRNBAUM, A+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1962::SAMPLING AND BAYES INFERENCE IN SCIENTIFIC MODELING AND ROBUSTNESS+BOX, GEP+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1980::CLASS OF ROBUST SAMPLING DESIGNS FOR LARGE-SCALE SURVEYS+BREWER, KRW+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1979::Testing Fisher, Neyman, Pearson, and Bayes+Christensen, R+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 2005::no title+Cox, D.

A framework for evaluating the utility of data altered to protect confidentiality,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313006X124640,AUG 2006,40,61,"When releasing data to the public, statistical agencies and survey organizations typically alter data values in order to protect the confidentiality of survey respondents' identities and attribute values. To select among the wide variety of data alteration methods, agencies require tools for evaluating the utility of proposed data releases. Such utility measures can be combined with disclosure risk measures to gauge risk-utility tradeoffs of competing methods. This article presents utility measures focused on differences in inferences obtained from the altered data and corresponding inferences obtained from. the original data. Using both genuine and simulated data, we show how the measures can be used in a decision-theoretic formulation for evaluating disclosure limitation procedures.","confidentiality,disclosure,disclosure risk,microdata,record linkage,statistical disclosure limitation,utility","DATA DISSEMINATION,RECORD-LINKAGE,DISCLOSURE,MICRODATA,RISK","Karr, A.

Penalized splines and reproducing kernel methods,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313006X124541,AUG 2006,44,24,"Two data analytic research areas-penalized splines and reproducing kernel methods-have become very vibrant since the mid-1990s. This article shows how the former can be embedded in the latter via theory for reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. This connection facilitates cross-fertilization between the two bodies of research. In particular, connections between support vector machines and penalized splines are established. These allow for significant reductions in computational complexity, and easier incorporation of special structure such as additivity.","bioinformatics,classification,data mining,generalized additive models,kernel machines,machine learning,mixed models,reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces,semi-parametric regression,statistical learning,supervised learning,support vector machines","SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES,CLASSIFICATION,NETWORKS,MODELS","Pearce, N.

Tukey's gh distribution for multiple imputation,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313006X126819,AUG 2006,8,27,"Tukey proposed a class of distributions, the g-and-h family (gh family), based on a transformation of a standard normal variable to accommodate different skewness and elongation in the distribution of variables arising in practical applications. It is easy to draw values from this distribution even though it is hard to explicitly state the probability density function. Given this flexibility, the gh family may be extremely useful in creating multiple imputations for missing data. This article demonstrates how this family, as well as its generalizations, can be used in the multiple imputation analysis of incomplete data. The focus of this article is on a scalar variable with missing values. In the absence of any additional information, data are missing completely at random, and hence the correct analysis is the complete-case analysis. Thus, the application of the gh multiple imputation to the scalar cases affords comparison with the correct analysis and with other model-based multiple imputation methods. Comparisons are made using simulated datasets and the data from a survey of adolescents ascertaining driving after drinking alcohol.","bootstrap,elongation,missing data,nonnormal data,quantiles,skewness",,"He, Yulei@Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA@Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth, Inst Social Res, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA::Raghunathan, Trivellore E.@Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA@Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth, Inst Social Res, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","He, Yulei@University of Michigan@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan::Raghunathan, Trivellore E.@University of Michigan@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan",not exist,"no title+HE Y+THESIS U MICHIGAN+2005::no title+Hoaglin, D.

A Lego system for conditional inference,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313006X118430,AUG 2006,22,249,"Conditioning on the observed data is an important and flexible design principle for statistical test procedures. Although generally applicable, permutation tests currently in use are limited to the treatment of special cases, such as contingency tables or K-sample problems. A new theoretical framework for permutation tests opens up the why to a unified and generalized view. This article argues that the transfer of such a theory to practical data analysis has important implications in many applications and requires tools that enable the data analyst to compute on the theoretical concepts as closely as possible. We reanalyze four datasets by adapting the general conceptual framework to these challenging inference problems and using the coin add-on package in the R system for statistical computing to show what one can gain from going, beyond the ""classical"" test procedures.","asymptotic distribution,independence,permutation tests,software","PERMUTATION TESTS,CLINICAL-TRIALS","Hothorn, Torsten@Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Inst Med Informat Biometrie & Epidemiol, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany@Wirtschaftsuniv Wien, Dept Math & Stat, A-1090 Vienna, Austria@Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Math, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands::Hornik, Kurt@Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Inst Med Informat Biometrie & Epidemiol, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany@Wirtschaftsuniv Wien, Dept Math & Stat, A-1090 Vienna, Austria@Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Math, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands::Van de Wiel, Mark A.@Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Inst Med Informat Biometrie & Epidemiol, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany@Wirtschaftsuniv Wien, Dept Math & Stat, A-1090 Vienna, Austria@Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Math, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands::Zeileis, Achim@Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Inst Med Informat Biometrie & Epidemiol, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany@Wirtschaftsuniv Wien, Dept Math & Stat, A-1090 Vienna, Austria@Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Math, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands","Hothorn, Torsten@University of Erlangen Nuremberg@Unknow@Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam::Hornik, Kurt@University of Erlangen Nuremberg@Unknow@Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam::Van de Wiel, Mark A.@University of Erlangen Nuremberg@Unknow@Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam::Zeileis, Achim@University of Erlangen Nuremberg@Unknow@Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam","Hothorn, Torsten@A-3639-2010@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8301-0471::van de Wiel, Mark@F-6759-2013::Hornik, Kurt@S-8548-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4198-9911::Zeileis, Achim@K-9226-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0918-3766","no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical Data Analysis+2002::An adjusted, asymmetric two-sample t test+Balkin, SD; Mallows, CL+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 2001::Pros and cons of permutation tests in clinical trials+Berger, VW+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+MAY 30 2000::Joint analysis of the NACP-REP1 marker within the alpha synuclein gene concludes association with alcohol dependence+Bonsch, D; Lederer, T; Reulbach, U; et al.+HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS+APR 1 2005::no title+Edgington, E.

On Bayesian analysis of generalized linear models using the Jacobian technique,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313006X128150,AUG 2006,5,3,"In this article, we obtain an estimator of the regression parameters for generalized linear models, using the Jacobian technique. We restrict ourselves to the natural exponential family for the response variable and choose the conjugate prior for the natural parameter. Using the Jacobian of transformation, we obtain the posterior distribution for the canonical link function and thereby obtain the posterior mode for the link. Under the full rank assumption for the covariate matrix, we then find an estimator for the regression parameters for the natural exponential family. Then the proposed estimator is specially derived for the Poisson model with log link function, and the binomial response model with the logit link function. We also discuss extensions to the binomial response model when covariates are all positive. Finally, an illustrative real-life example is given for the Poisson model with log link. In order to estimate the standard error of our estimators, we use the Bernstein-von Mises theorem. Finally, we compare the results using our Jacobian technique with a maximum likelihood estimates for the regression parameters.","Bernstein-von Mises theorem,canonical link,conjugate prior,log link,natural exponential family,posterior mode,regression parameter",,"Das, Sourish@Univ Connecticut, Dept Stat, Storrs, CT 06269 USA::Dey, Dipak K.@Univ Connecticut, Dept Stat, Storrs, CT 06269 USA","Das, Sourish@University of Connecticut::Dey, Dipak K.@University of Connecticut",not exist,"no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical Data Analysis+2002::CONJUGATE PRIORS FOR EXPONENTIAL FAMILIES+DIACONIS, P; YLVISAKER, D+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1979::no title+Ferguson, T.+A Course in Large Sample Theory+1996::ON BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS OF GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS USING JEFFREYS PRIOR+IBRAHIM, JG; LAUD, PW+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1991::no title+McCullagh, P.; Nelder, J.+Generalized Linear Models+1989"

The three packages, MIM, Tetrad and WinMine, can help researchers discover underlying causal structure. Although each package uses a different algorithm, the results are to some extent similar. All three packages are free and easy to use. They are likely to be of interest to researchers who do not have strong theory regarding the causal structure in their data. DAG modeling is a powerful analytic tool to consider in conjunction with, or in place of, path analysis, structural equation modeling, and other statistical techniques.","Bayesian networks,causality,data mining,indirect effects",BAYESIAN NETWORKS,"Haughton, Dominique@Bentley Coll, Waltham, MA 02452 USA::Kamis, Arnold@Bentley Coll, Waltham, MA 02452 USA::Scholten, Patrick@Bentley Coll, Waltham, MA 02452 USA","Haughton, Dominique@Unknow::Kamis, Arnold@Unknow::Scholten, Patrick@Unknow","Kamis, Arnold@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4222-9730","Vector autoregression, policy analysis, and directed graphs: an application to the US economy+Awokuse, TO; Bessler, DA.+J Appl Econ+2003::no title+BESSLER D+WORLD POVERTY CAUSAL+2003::Economic development: Evidence from directed acyclic graphs+Bessler, DA; Loper, N+MANCHESTER SCHOOL+SEP 2001::The evaluation of evidence in the forensic investigation of fire incidents (Part 1): an approach using Bayesian networks+Biedermann, A; Taroni, F; Delemont, O; et al.+FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL+JAN 6 2005::no title+Edwards, D.+Introduction to Graphical Modelling+2000::Using Bayesian networks to analyze expression data+Friedman, N; Linial, M; Nachman, I; et al.+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY+2000::no title+HAUGHTON D+LIVING STANDARDS EC+2001::The determinants of infant mortality in Malaysia: A graphical chain modelling approach+Mohamed, WN+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1998::no title+Murphy, K.+A Brief Introduction to Graphical Models and Bayesian Networks+1998::Providing Websites with capabilities of one-to-one marketing+Mussi, S+EXPERT SYSTEMS+FEB 2003::no title+Pearl, J.+Causality+2000::Causation, Prediction and Search+Spirtes, P.; Glymour, C.; Scheines, R.+LECT NOTES STAT+1993::no title+*TETR+TETR PROJ+2006::no title+*WIK+DIR AC GRAPH+2006::no title+*WIK+GRAPH MATH+2006::no title+*WINMINE+WINMINE TOOLK+2006::Prediction and assessment of student behaviour in open and distance education in computers using Bayesian networks+Xenos, M+COMPUTERS &amp; EDUCATION+DEC 2004"

A Bayesian cluster analysis of these rows confirms the existence of that boundary. and reveals a few chapters that are misclassified by the estimated change-point.

"A quick, compact, two-sample dispersion test: Count five",AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313005X22248,FEB 2005,26,3,"The common ""F test"" for testing the equality of two population variances is very sensitive to the normality assumption, yet many introductory statistics books do not stress this sensitivity. Several alternative dispersion tests have been developed that do not assume normality, but these are rarely discussed other than in nonparametric statistics texts. Additionally, these tests generally require tables of critical values or software to calculate p values. We propose a simple graphical procedure, requiring no tables or software, that compares absolute deviations of one sample to another. With equal sample sizes, if one sample has the five largest absolute deviations. we conclude that its population has,greater dispersion. We believe the simplicity of this test makes it a viable alternative to the often misleading F test and to other tests.","nonparametric,scale,variance","VARIANCES,SCALE,EQUALITY,SUM","McGrath, RN@Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Appl Stat & Operat Res, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA::Yeh, AB@Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Appl Stat & Operat Res, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA","McGrath, RN@Bowling Green State University::Yeh, AB@Bowling Green State University",not exist,"no title+ANDERSON DR+STAT BUSINESS EC+2005::RANK-SUM TESTS FOR DISPERSIONS+ANSARI, AR; BRADLEY, RA+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1960::no title+BERENSON ML+BASIC BUSINESS STAT+2002::no title+BRASE CH+UNDERSTANDABLE STAT+1999::Robust tests for the Equality of Variances+BROWN, M.

A sufficiency paradox: An insufficient statistic preserving the Fisher information,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313005X21041,FEB 2005,8,3,"An example of a regular statistical experiment is constructed where an insufficient statistic preserves the Fisher information contained in the data. The data are a pair (A, X) where A is a binary random variable and, given Delta, X has a density f(x-theta\Delta) depending on a location parameter theta. The phenomenon is based on the fact that f (x\Delta) smoothly vanishes at one point; it can be eliminated by adding to the regularity of a statistical experiment positivity of the density function.","convexity,regularity,statistical experiment",,"Kagan, A@Univ Maryland, Dept Math, College Pk, MD 20742 USA@Rutgers State Univ, Dept Stat, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA::Shepp, LA@Univ Maryland, Dept Math, College Pk, MD 20742 USA@Rutgers State Univ, Dept Stat, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA","Kagan, A@University System of Maryland@University of Maryland College Park@Rutgers State University New Brunswick::Shepp, LA@University System of Maryland@University of Maryland College Park@Rutgers State University New Brunswick",not exist,"no title+AKAHIRA M+J COMPUTING INFORMAT+1991::A CHARACTERIZATION OF SUFFICIENCY+BAHADUR, RR+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1955::no title+Huber, P.

Randomization of clusters versus randomization of persons within clusters: Which is preferable?,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/0003113005X20727,FEB 2005,17,15,"Many experiments aim at populations with persons nested within clusters. Randomization to treatment conditions can be done at the cluster level or at the person level within each cluster. The latter may result in control group contamination, and cluster randomization is therefore often preferred in practice. This article models the control group contamination, calculates the required sample sizes for both levels of randomization, and gives the degree of contamination for which cluster randomization is preferable above randomization of persons within clusters. Moreover, it provides examples of situations where one has to make a choice between both levels of randomization.","experimental design,intervention study,intra-cluster correlation coefficient,nested data,relative efficiency","PREVENTION TRIAL,DESIGN,INTERVENTION,MODELS","Moerbeek, M@Univ Utrecht, Dept Methodol & Stat, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands","Moerbeek, M@Utrecht University",not exist,"Short-term effects of a Randomized computer-based out-of-school smoking prevention trial aimed at elementary schoolchildren+Ausems, M; Mesters, I; van Breukelen, G; et al.+PREVENTIVE MEDICINE+JUN 2002::RUFLOXACIN ONCE-DAILY VERSUS CIPROFLOXACIN TWICE-DAILY IN THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH ACUTE UNCOMPLICATED PYELONEPHRITIS+BACH, D; VANDENBERGSEGERS, A; HUBNER, A; et al.+JOURNAL OF UROLOGY+JUL 1995::The NIMH multisite HIV prevention trial: Reducing HIV sexual risk behavior+Celentano, DD; Dilorio, C; Hartwell, T; et al.+SCIENCE+JUN 19 1998::METHODS FOR COMPARING EVENT RATES IN INTERVENTION STUDIES WHEN THE UNIT OF ALLOCATION IS A CLUSTER+DONNER, A; KLAR, N+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+AUG 1 1994::RANDOMIZATION BY CLUSTER - SAMPLE-SIZE REQUIREMENTS AND ANALYSIS+DONNER, A; BIRKETT, N; BUCK, C+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+1981::On design considerations and randomization-based inference for community intervention trials+Gail, MH; Mark, SD; Carroll, RJ; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUN 15 1996::no title+Goldstein, H.+Multilevel Statistical Models+1995::no title+GRAVEN RG+J EDUC PSYCHOL+2001::MULTISITE EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING-PROGRAM EVALUATIONS - A TALE OF 3 STUDIES+GREENBERG, D; MEYER, RH; WISEMAN, M+INDUSTRIAL &amp; LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW+JUL 1994::ANALYSIS OF CLUSTERED DATA IN COMMUNITY PSYCHOLOGY - WITH AN EXAMPLE FROM A WORKSITE SMOKING CESSATION PROJECT+HEDEKER, D; MCMAHON, SD; JASON, LA; et al.+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY PSYCHOLOGY+OCT 1994::RANDOM REGRESSION-MODELS FOR MULTICENTER CLINICAL-TRIALS DATA+HEDEKER, D; GIBBONS, RD; DAVIS, JM+PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY BULLETIN+1991::Optimal experimental designs for multilevel models with covariates+Moerbeek, M; Van Breukelen, GJP; Berger, MPF+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2001::A multilevel perspective on the design and analysis of intervention studies+Plewis, I.; Hurry, J.+Educational Research and Evaluation+1998::Statistical power and optimal design for multisite randomized trials+Raudenbush, SW; Liu, XF+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+JUN 2000::Cluster versus individual randomization in adolescent tobacco and alcohol studies: Illustrations for design decisions+Slymen, DJ; Hovell, MF+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+AUG 1997::IMPACT OF VITAMIN-A SUPPLEMENTATION ON CHILDHOOD MORTALITY - A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED COMMUNITY TRIAL+SOMMER, A; DJUNAEDI, E; LOEDEN, AA; et al.+LANCET+MAY 24 1986::Contamination in trials: is cluster randomisation the answer?+Torgerson, DJ+BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL+FEB 10 2001"
Relationship between Bayesian and frequentist sample size determination,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313005X21069,FEB 2005,23,27,"Sample size determination is among the most commonly encountered tasks in statistical practice. A broad range of frequentist and Bayesian methods for sample size determination can be described as choosing the smallest sample that is sufficient to achieve some set of goals. An example for the frequentist is seeking the smallest sample size that is sufficient to achieve a desired power at a specified significance level. An example for the Bayesian is seeking the smallest sample size necessary to obtain, in expectation, a desired rate of correct classification of the hypothesis as true or false. This article explores parallels between Bayesian and frequentist methods for determining sample size. We provide a simple but general and pragmatic framework for investigating the relationship between the two approaches, based on identifying mappings to connect the Bayesian and frequentist inputs necessary to obtain the same sample size. We illustrate this mapping with examples. highlighting a somewhat surprising ""approximate functional correspondence"" between power-based and information-based optimal sample sizes.","lindley information,prior information.,probabilities of type I and type II errors","INFORMATION,HYPOTHESIS","Inoue, LYT@Univ Washington, Dept Biostat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA@Univ Texas, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Biostat, Houston, TX 77030 USA@Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Oncol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA@Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biostat, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA::Berry, DA@Univ Washington, Dept Biostat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA@Univ Texas, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Biostat, Houston, TX 77030 USA@Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Oncol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA@Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biostat, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA::Parmigiani, G@Univ Washington, Dept Biostat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA@Univ Texas, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Biostat, Houston, TX 77030 USA@Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Oncol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA@Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biostat, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Inoue, LYT@University of Washington@University of Washington Seattle@UTMD Anderson Cancer Center@University of Texas System@Johns Hopkins University@Johns Hopkins University::Berry, DA@University of Washington@University of Washington Seattle@UTMD Anderson Cancer Center@University of Texas System@Johns Hopkins University@Johns Hopkins University::Parmigiani, G@University of Washington@University of Washington Seattle@UTMD Anderson Cancer Center@University of Texas System@Johns Hopkins University@Johns Hopkins University",not exist,"Sample size determination: A review+Adcock, CJ+STATISTICIAN+1997::no title+Berger, J.+Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis+1985::A UNIFIED CONDITIONAL FREQUENTIST AND BAYESIAN TEST FOR FIXED AND SEQUENTIAL SIMPLE HYPOTHESIS-TESTING+BERGER, JO; BROWN, LD; WOLPERT, RL+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1994::Unified frequentist and Bayesian testing of a precise hypothesis+Berger, JO; Boukai, B; Wang, Y+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+AUG 1997::no title+BERNARDO JM+REV REAL ACAD CIEN M+1979::Statistical inference as a decision problem: The choice of sample size+Bernardo, JM+STATISTICIAN+1997::no title+DeGroot, M.

A review of two text-mining packages: SAS TextMining and WordStat,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313005X22987,FEB 2005,4,17,"The purpose of this article is to review two text mining packages, namely, WordStat and SAS TextMiner. WordStat is developed by Provalis Research. SAS TextMiner is a product Of SAS. We review the features offered by each package on each of the following key steps in analyzing unstructured data: (1) data preparation. including importing and cleaning- (2) performing association analysis; and (3) presenting the findings, including illustrative quotes and graphs. We also evaluate each package on its ability to help researchers extract major themes from a dataset. Both packages offer a variety of features that effectively help researchers run associations and present results. However. in extracting themes from unstructured data, both packages were only marginally helpful. The researcher still needs to read the data and make all the difficult decisions. This finding stems from the fact that the software can search only for specific terms in documents or categorize documents based on common terms. Respondents, however. may use the same term or combination of terms to mean different things. This implies that a text mining approach, which is based on analysis units other than terms, may be more powerful in extracting themes, an idea we touch upon in the conclusion section.","clustering,correspondence analysis,theme extraction,unstructured data",,"Davi, A@Bentley Coll, Waltham, MA 02452 USA::Haughton, D@Bentley Coll, Waltham, MA 02452 USA::Nasr, N@Bentley Coll, Waltham, MA 02452 USA::Shah, G@Bentley Coll, Waltham, MA 02452 USA::Skaletsky, M@Bentley Coll, Waltham, MA 02452 USA::Spack, R@Bentley Coll, Waltham, MA 02452 USA","Davi, A@Unknow::Haughton, D@Unknow::Nasr, N@Unknow::Shah, G@Unknow::Skaletsky, M@Unknow::Spack, R@Unknow",not exist,"no title+*INS CORP+INF WHIT PAP+2004::QUALITATIVE DATA AS AN ATTRACTIVE NUISANCE - PROBLEM OF ANALYSIS+MILES, MB+ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE QUARTERLY+1979::Text mining tools take on unstructured data+Robb, D.+Computerworld+2004::no title+*SAS+SAS TEXT MIN+2004"

The survey collects information on undergraduate enrollments in courses in the mathematical sciences and on the demographics of faculty members. It also asks about the undergraduate curriculum to determine what is taught, who teaches it, and how it is taught. The 2000 CBMS survey, for the first time, sampled departments of statistics separately and asked questions about the educational backgrounds of those teaching statistics in departments of mathematics.

Marginal structural models are a flexible new set of causal models. The estimation methods used to estimate model parameters use weighting to control for confounding; this allows more flexibility in choosing covariates for inclusion in the structural model and allows the model to more precisely reflect the scientific questions of interest. An important example of this is in multicenter observational studies where there is confounding by cluster. We illustrate these points with data from a study of surgery to provide vascular access for hemodialysis and a study comparing different timings for coronary angioplasty.","causality,prediction,weighting","CORONARY ANGIOPLASTY,REGRESSION-MODELS,LONGITUDINAL DATA,CLUSTERED DATA,COMPLICATIONS,ASSOCIATION,ZIDOVUDINE,CAUSATION,INFERENCE,RISK","Joffe, MM@Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA::Ten Have, TR@Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA::Feldman, HI@Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA::Kimmel, SE@Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Joffe, MM@University of Pennsylvania::Ten Have, TR@University of Pennsylvania::Feldman, HI@University of Pennsylvania::Kimmel, SE@University of Pennsylvania",not exist,"An empirical comparison of several clustered data approaches under confounding due to cluster effects in the analysis of complications of coronary angioplasty+Berlin, JA; Kimmel, SE; Ten Have, TR; et al.+BIOMETRICS+JUN 1999::no title+Breslow,, N.; Day,, N.+Statistical Methods in Cancer Research.

Bayesian randomized response as a class project,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313004X5455,NOV 2004,22,2,"This article describes multiple learning opportunities stemming from a classroom project about psychological therapy analyzed through the Bayesian framework. Because the dataset is rather small, students focus naturally on prior elicitation, issues of identifiability and sensitivity analysis. In addition, because there is not a familiar closed form solution, students are forced to apply relevant simulation techniques, including rejection sampling, Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, data augmentation, simulation of Bayes factors, and other model selection criteria. Comparison with surprising frequentist results prompts a reflection of the pros and cons of either approach. Key features for project success (writing skills, feedback) are discussed.","prior selection,simulation,statistics education","DISTRIBUTIONS,MODEL,BIAS","DiPietro, M@Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Stat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA@Carnegie Mellon Univ, Eberly Ctr Teaching Excellence, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA","DiPietro, M@Carnegie Mellon University@Carnegie Mellon University",not exist,"no title+Carlin, BP; Louis, TA.+Bayes and Empirical Bayes Methods for Data Analysis+2000::You can load a die, but you can't bias a coin+Gelman, A; Nolan, D+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+NOV 2002::STOCHASTIC RELAXATION, GIBBS DISTRIBUTIONS, AND THE BAYESIAN RESTORATION OF IMAGES+GEMAN, S; GEMAN, D+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE+1984::MONTE-CARLO SAMPLING METHODS USING MARKOV CHAINS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS+HASTINGS, WK+BIOMETRIKA+1970::The unrelated question RR model+Horvitz, D.

Random walks as motivational material in introductory statistics and probability courses,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313004X5482,NOV 2004,16,1,"Recent articles have described the advantages of teaching elementary statistics and probability classes using approaches that encourage greater student engagement, including experimentation, with the subject matter. We describe our experiences in introducing the subject of random walks to small groups of high-school and first-year college students. As we show in this article, the topic of random walks provides a superb way for instructors to introduce a class to elementary simulation problems, calculation of expectations and measures of variability for geometric distributions, real-world interpretation and consequences for the divergence of infinite series, and the behavior of random walks on restricted sets in the plane. Most enchantingly, all facets of this journey are entirely accessible to an involved class of students equipped with minimal knowledge of calculus. Based on our experiences, we strongly recommend student involvement in the teaching of introductory concepts to small classes.","chance database project,collaborative learning,Jack-or-Jill controversy,involvement-based teaching,statistical education","INCREASING STUDENT PARTICIPATION,BALLOT PROBLEM","Fisher, LA@Woodstock Union High Sch, Woodstock, VT 05091 USA@Univ Vermont, Dept Math & Stat, Burlington, VT 05405 USA::Richards, DS@Woodstock Union High Sch, Woodstock, VT 05091 USA@Univ Vermont, Dept Math & Stat, Burlington, VT 05405 USA","Fisher, LA@Unknow@University of Vermont::Richards, DS@Unknow@University of Vermont",not exist,"no title+Andrews, G.

Multidimensional scaling for selecting small groups in college courses,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,NO DOI,NOV 2004,11,0,"Many college courses use group work as a part of the learning and evaluation process. Class groups are often selected randomly or by allowing students to organize groups themselves. However, if it is desired to control some aspect of the group structure, such as increasing schedule compatibility within groups, multidimensional scaling can be used to form such groups. This article describes how this has been adopted in an undergraduate statistics course. Resulting groups have been more homogeneous with respect to student schedules than groups selected randomly-an example from winter quarter 2004 increased correlations between student schedules from a mean of .29 before grouping to a within-group mean of .50. Further, the exercise allows opportunities to discuss a wealth of statistical concepts in class, including surveys, association measures, multidimensional scaling, and statistical graphics.","cooperative learning,ordination,perceptual mapping,principal coordinate analysis,teaching",,"Pardoe, L@Univ Oregon, Charles H Lundquist Coll Business, Dept Decis Sci, Eugene, OR 97403 USA","Pardoe, L@University of Oregon@Oregon University System",not exist,"no title+GARFIELD J+J STAT ED+1993::no title+GIRAUD G+J STAT ED+1997::no title+JOHNSON DW+ASHE ERIC HIGHER ED+1991::no title+KEELER CM+J STAT ED+1995::THE TREATMENT OF TIES IN RANKING PROBLEMS+KENDALL, MG+BIOMETRIKA+1945::no title+KRUSKAL JB+SAGE U PAPER QUANTIT+1978::no title+MAGEL RC+J STAT ED+1998::no title+no author+Principles and standards for school mathematics+2000::no title+no author+Everybody counts: A report to the nation on the future of mathematics education+1989::THE ANALYSIS OF PROXIMITIES - MULTIDIMENSIONAL-SCALING WITH AN UNKNOWN DISTANCE FUNCTION .1.+SHEPARD, RN+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1962::no title+Torgerson, WS.+Theory and Methods of Scaling+1958"
Tunable approximations for the mean and variance of the maximum of heterogeneous geometrically distributed random variables,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313004X5509,NOV 2004,11,8,"Analysis of the maximum of n independent geometrically distributed random variables arises in a variety of applications in computer science and engineering. Evaluating the mean and variance of the maximum when n is large presents considerable computational challenges. Although approximate formulas have been proposed in the case where each geometric distribution has the same probability of success, the heterogeneous case has not received any attention. We derive an epsilon-accurate approximation for both the mean and the variance in the heterogeneous case. The approximations also apply to the homogeneous case, and offer something new with their ability to tune the approximation to any desired level of accuracy. We illustrate the formulas with a reliability application where the heterogeneous context arose quite naturally.","expected value,extreme value,negative binomial,system throughput","ORDER-STATISTICS,REDUNDANT SYSTEMS","Jeske, DR@Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Stat, Riverside, CA 92521 USA@Food & Drug Adm, Rockville, MD 20855 USA::Blessinger, T@Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Stat, Riverside, CA 92521 USA@Food & Drug Adm, Rockville, MD 20855 USA","Jeske, DR@University of California System@University of California Riverside@US Food & Drug Administration (FDA)::Blessinger, T@University of California System@University of California Riverside@US Food & Drug Administration (FDA)",not exist,"EXTREME VALUE THEORY FOR A CLASS OF DISCRETE DISTRIBUTIONS WITH APPLICATIONS TO SOME STOCHASTIC PROCESSES+ANDERSON, CW+JOURNAL OF APPLIED PROBABILITY+1970::no title+ARNOLD B+1 COURS ORDER STAT+1992::PROBABILISTIC COUNTING ALGORITHMS FOR DATABASE APPLICATIONS+FLAJOLET, P; MARTIN, GN+JOURNAL OF COMPUTER AND SYSTEM SCIENCES+OCT 1985::no title+GRABNER PJ+PROBABILITY COMPUTIN+1997::no title+HENRICI P+APPL COMPUTATIONAL C+1975::no title+KIRSCHENHOFER P+COMPUTING+1993::EXACT MOMENTS OF ORDER STATISTICS OF GEOMETRIC DISTRIBUTION AND THEIR RELATION TO INVERSE SAMPLING AND RELIABILITY OF REDUNDANT SYSTEMS+MARGOLIN, BH; WINOKUR, HS+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1967::no title+Shooman, M.

Use of R as a toolbox for mathematical statistics exploration,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313004X5572,NOV 2004,37,11,"The R language, a freely available environment for statistical computing and graphics is widely used in many fields. This ""expert-friendly"" system has a powerful command language and programming environment, combined with an active user community. We discuss how R is ideal as a platform to support experimentation in mathematical statistics, both at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Using a series of case studies and activities, we describe how R can be used in a mathematical statistics course as a toolbox for experimentation. Examples include the calculation of a running average, maximization of a nonlinear function, resampling of a statistic, simple Bayesian modeling, sampling from multivariate normal, and estimation of power. These activities, often requiring only a few dozen lines of code, offer students the opportunity to explore statistical concepts and experiment. In addition, they provide an introduction to the framework and idioms available in this rich environment.","mathematical statistics education,statistical computing",COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS,"Horton, NJ@Smith Coll, Dept Math, Northampton, MA 01063 USA@Univ Washington, Dept Biostat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA::Brown, ER@Smith Coll, Dept Math, Northampton, MA 01063 USA@Univ Washington, Dept Biostat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA::Qian, LJ@Smith Coll, Dept Math, Northampton, MA 01063 USA@Univ Washington, Dept Biostat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Horton, NJ@Smith College@University of Washington@University of Washington Seattle::Brown, ER@Smith College@University of Washington@University of Washington Seattle::Qian, LJ@Smith College@University of Washington@University of Washington Seattle","Horton, Nicholas@A-2493-2008@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3332-4311::Brown, Elizabeth@A-8984-2008","no title+Adams, D.+The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy+1980::no title+*AM STAT ASS+CURR GUID UND PROGR+2004::COMPUTER ALGEBRA SYSTEMS - MAPLE AND MATHEMATICAL - MATHEMATICA FOR THE MACINTOSH, VERSION-2.0.4 (ENHANCED VERSION-2.0)+BAGLIVO, J+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+FEB 1995::no title+BAGLIVO J+ASA SIAM SERIES STAT+2005::no title+Casella, G.; Berger, R.+Statistical Inference+2002::no title+COBB G+UME TRENDS+1991::no title+DALGAARD, P.+Introductory Statistics with R+2002::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::no title+Diggle, P.; Diggle, P.+Analysis of Longitudinal Data+2002::GRADUATE-EDUCATION IN COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS+EDDY, WF; JONES, AC; KASS, RE; et al.+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+FEB 1987::no title+Efron, B.+An Introduction to the Bootstrap+1993::no title+FOX J+R S PLUS COMPANION A+2002::no title+Gelman, A.

One game each winter (the specific game rotates among the four participating games) hosts the national championship game between the top two teams in the BCS ranking. The BCS has been a controversial system since its implementation prior to the 1998 season with the most recent 2003 season producing a disputed championship, the very thing the BCS system was developed to avoid. This current article reviews the history of the college football national championship, the rise of the BCS, the BCS ranking system, and the contributions that statistical thinking can make toward improving the BCS.

These statistically corrected counts were used for congressional apportionment and redistricting. In 2002, the Supreme Court ruled that this limited use of statistics was both lawful and constitutional. This article provides a context for that decision, by tracing the evolution of statistical methods in the U.S. census, and the accompanying litigation.

Six approaches to calculating standardized logistic regression coefficients,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313004X946,AUG 2004,20,93,"This article reviews six alternative approaches to constructing standardized logistic regression coefficients. The least attractive of the options is the one currently most readily available in logistic regression software, the unstandardized coefficient divided by its standard error (which is actually the normal distribution version of the Wald statistic). One alternative has the advantage of simplicity, while a slightly more complex alternative most closely parallels the standardized coefficient in ordinary least squares regression, in the sense of being based on variance in the dependent variable and the predictors. The sixth alternative, based on information theory, may be the best from a conceptual standpoint, but unless and until appropriate algorithms are constructed to simplify its calculation, its use is limited to relatively simple logistic regression models in practical application.","information theory,logit model","CAUSAL-ANALYSIS,VARIABLES","Menard, S@Univ Colorado, Inst Behav Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Menard, S@University of Colorado System@University of Colorado Boulder","Menard, Scott@A-9328-2009@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8757-4247","no title+Agresti, A.+An Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis+1996::no title+AGRESTI A+STAT METHODS SOCIAL+1986::no title+Bohrnstedt, G.

The St. Petersburg paradox and the crash of high-tech stocks in 2000,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313004X1440,AUG 2004,34,7,"During the late 1990s high technology growth stock prices were raised to unprecedented levels by avid stock purchasers around the world. In early 2000, share prices subsequently underwent prolonged declines, leaving many purchasers with devastating losses. This article reviews some aspects of the history of the St. Petersburg paradox and some related games. We recount a remarkable article by Durand in which the valuation of growth stocks is related to the St. Petersburg paradox. Our conclusion is that the run-up in stock prices in the late 1990s and the subsequent declines in 2000 could have been avoided by an analysis and application of the St. Petersburg paradox.","Alan Greenspan,Cleveland Indians Baseball Team,fair game of chance,geometric distribution,high technology stocks,irrational exuberance,Mark Twain,mutual funds,utility function,valuation of growth stocks","GROWTH,GAMES","Szekely, GJ@Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA@Hungarian Acad Sci, Renyi Inst, Budapest, Hungary@Penn State Univ, Dept Stat, University Pk, PA 16802 USA::Richards, DSP@Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA@Hungarian Acad Sci, Renyi Inst, Budapest, Hungary@Penn State Univ, Dept Stat, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Szekely, GJ@Bowling Green State University@Hungarian Academy of Sciences@Penn State University@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)::Richards, DSP@Bowling Green State University@Hungarian Academy of Sciences@Penn State University@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)",not exist,"no title+ADLER A+J THEORET PROBAB+1990::The two envelope paradox and infinite expectations+Arntzenius, F; McCarthy, D+ANALYSIS+JAN 1997::Almost sure limit theorems for the St. Petersburg game+Berkes, I; Csaki, E; Csorgo, S+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+OCT 15 1999::Exposition of a new theory on the measurement of risk+Bernoulli, D.+Proc.

"""Transmuting"" women into men: Galton's family data on human stature",AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/0000313004X1558,AUG 2004,15,14,"The first two regression lines, and the first correlations, were calculated by Francis Galton, in his work on heredity in sweet peas and in humans. When ""regressing"" the heights of adult children on those of their parents, Galton had to deal with the fact that men are generally taller than women-but without modern-day statistical tools such as multiple regression and partial correlation. This article uses the family data on stature, which we obtained directly from Galton's notebooks, to (a) compare the sharpness of his methods, relative to modern-day ones, for dealing with this complication; and (b) estimate the additional familial component of variance in stature beyond that contributed by the parental heights. In keeping with Galton's plea for ""a manuscript library of original data,"" these historical and pedagogically valuable data are now available to the statistical community as digital photographs and as a dataset ready for further analyses.","correlation,data repository,historical data,random-effects model,regression,transformations",,"Hanley, JA@McGill Univ, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Montreal, PQ H3A 1A2, Canada","Hanley, JA@McGill University",not exist,"Galton's midparent height revisited+Cole, TJ+ANNALS OF HUMAN BIOLOGY+JUL-AUG 2000::no title+Galton, F.+Biometry.

Teaching experimental design,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313004X1477,AUG 2004,9,4,"After a career as a consulting statistician, I decided to teach. This article describes my evolving views as I developed and taught introductory university courses on experimental design, organized around and stimulated by three different texts and three different universities. Primarily, I found it to be essential, particularly at the course's beginning, to embed textbook examples in credible scientific or business contexts in order to try to convince students of the value of statistical experimental design and analysis in their subsequent careers. In contrast, uninteresting, even nonsensical, undeveloped examples that serve only as formula drill Give students the opposite impression. My purpose in this article is to present selected expanded textbook examples and to use these illustrations to examine fundamental issues in experimental design such as: the importance of subject-matter, the choice of experimental units, the nature and purpose of blocking, and the contrast between random sampling and random assignment of treatments. These examples expose fundamental issues in how our profession functions in a collaborative environment and how we prepare the next generation of statisticians and statistically savvy professionals. My hope is that the illustrations provided will be directly useful to beginning instructors and provocative to the experienced.","blocking,experimental units,randomization,replication,students,statistical thinking",,"Easterling, RG@Sandia Natl Labs, Livermore, CA 94550 USA","Easterling, RG@United States Department of Energy (DOE)@Sandia National Laboratory",not exist,"no title+Box, G.

We review a recent legal case from Ireland where four individuals brought a case against their employer, alleging age discrimination following unsuccessful applications in a promotional competition. After an equality officer initially ruled against the employer in favor of the complainants, the employer appealed and this resulted in a more formal Labour Court hearing. It was at this stage the two authors (and statisticians) were asked to act as expert witnesses for the respective sides.

Partial one-dimensional regression models,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/0003130043240,MAY 2004,18,4,"Many regression problems have one grouping variable or factor and several covariates, and the goal of the problem is to understand differences in the regressions between levels of the grouping variable. Standard approaches to this require fitting main effects and grouping variable by covariate interactions, potentially leading to complex models if the number of covariates is greater than one. Using the ideas of the dimension of a regression problem, and dimension reduction, we describe the use of one-dimensional models fit separately to each level of the grouping variable.

Two statistical paradoxes in the interpretation of group differences: Illustrated with medical school admission and licensing data,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/0003130043268,MAY 2004,13,25,"Interpreting group differences observed in aggregated data is a practice that must be done with enormous care. Often the truth underlying such data is quite different than a native first look would indicate. The confusions that can arise are so perplexing that some of the more frequently occurring ones have been dubbed paradoxes. This article describes two of these paradoxes-Simpson's paradox and Lord's paradox-and illustrates them in a single dataset. The dataset contains the score distributions, separated by race, on the biological sciences component of the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) and Step 1 of the United States Medical Licensing Examination(TM) (USMLE). Our goal in examining these data was to move toward a greater understanding of race differences in admissions policies in medical schools. As we demonstrate, the path toward this goal is hindered by differences in the score distributions which gives rise to these two paradoxes. The ease with which we were able to illustrate both of these paradoxes within a single dataset is indicative of how widespread they are likely to be in practice.","group differences,Lord's paradox,Medical College Admission Test,Rubin's model for causal inference,Simpson's paradox,standardization,United States Medical Licensing Examination",SIMPSONS PARADOX,"Wainer, H@Natl Board Med Examiners, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA::Brown, LM@Natl Board Med Examiners, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Wainer, H@Unknow::Brown, LM@Unknow",not exist,"Good for women, good for men, bad for people: Simpson's paradox and the importance of sex-specific analysis in observational studies+Baker, SG; Kramer, BS+JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH &amp; GENDER-BASED MEDICINE+NOV 2001::SIMPSONS PARADOX AND SURE-THING PRINCIPLE+BLYTH, CR+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1972::OnLordsparadox+Holland, P.W.; Rubin, D.B.+Principalsof ModernPsychologicalMeasurement+1983::Chances of Simpson's paradox+Jeon, JW; Chung, HY; Bae, JS.+Journal of the Korean Statistical Society+1987::A PARADOX IN INTERPRETATION OF GROUP COMPARISONS+LORD, FM+PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN+1967::Monotone regrouping, regression, and Simpson's paradox+Rinott, Y; Tam, M+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 2003::ESTIMATING CAUSAL EFFECTS OF TREATMENTS IN RANDOMIZED AND NONRANDOMIZED STUDIES+RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY+1974::SIMPSON PARADOX AND RELATED PHENOMENA+SAMUELS, ML+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::THE INTERPRETATION OF INTERACTION IN CONTINGENCY TABLES+SIMPSON, EH+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1951::MINORITY CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SAT SCORE TURNAROUND - AN EXAMPLE OF SIMPSON PARADOX+WAINER, H+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL STATISTICS+WIN 1986::ADJUSTING FOR DIFFERENTIAL BASE RATES - LORDS PARADOX AGAIN+WAINER, H+PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN+JAN 1991::no title+WESTBROOKE I+CHANCE+1998::Notes on the theory of association of attributes in statistics+Yule, G.

The effect of dependence on confidence intervals for a population proportion,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/0003130043303,MAY 2004,30,12,"The binomial model is widely used in statistical applications. Usually, the success probability, p, and its associated confidence interval are estimated from a random sample. Thus, the observations are independent and identically distributed. Motivated by a legal case where some grand jurors could serve a second year, this article shows that when the observations are dependent, even slightly, the coverage probabilities of the usual confidence intervals can deviate noticeably from their nominal level. Several modified confidence intervals that incorporate the dependence structure are proposed and examined. Our results show that the modified Wilson, Agresti-Coull, and Jeffreys confidence intervals perform well and can be recommended for general use.","coverage probability,dependent observations,expected length of confidence interval,jury discrimination","BINOMIAL PROPORTION,MARKOV-CHAIN,APPROXIMATE,TRIALS,PARAMETER","Miao, WW@Macalester Coll, Dept Math & Comp Sci, St Paul, MN 55105 USA@George Washington Univ, Dept Stat, Washington, DC 20052 USA@NCI, Div Canc Epidemiol & Genet, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA::Gastwirth, JL@Macalester Coll, Dept Math & Comp Sci, St Paul, MN 55105 USA@George Washington Univ, Dept Stat, Washington, DC 20052 USA@NCI, Div Canc Epidemiol & Genet, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Miao, WW@Macalester College@George Washington University@NIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)@National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA::Gastwirth, JL@Macalester College@George Washington University@NIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)@National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA",not exist,"Approximate is better than ""exact"" for interval estimation of binomial proportions+Agresti, A; Coull, BA+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1998::APPROXIMATE CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS FOR THE PARAMETERS OF A STATIONARY BINARY MARKOV-CHAIN+BEDRICK, EJ; ARAGON, J+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1989::no title+Beran, J.+Statistics for long-memory processes+1994::BINOMIAL CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS+BLYTH, CR; STILL, HA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1983::BETTER APPROXIMATE CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS FOR A BINOMIAL PARAMETER+BOHNING, D+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+JUN 1994::no title+BRAINERD B+CANADIAN J STAT+1982::Confidence intervals for a binomial proportion and asymptotic expansions+Brown, LD; Cai, TT; DasGupta, A+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 2002::Interval estimation for a binomial proportion - Comment - Rejoinder+Brown, LD; Cai, TT; DasGupta, A; et al.+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 2001::The saw-toothed behavior of power versus sample size and software solutions: Single binomial proportion using exact methods+Chernick, MR; Liu, CY+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 2002::APPROXIMATE CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS FOR A PROPORTION FROM MARKOV DEPENDENT TRIALS+CROW, EL+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS PART B-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+1979::VALIDATION OF ESTIMATORS OF A PROPORTION FROM MARKOV DEPENDENT TRIALS+CROW, EL; MILES, MJ+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS PART B-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+1979::no title+Fleiss, J.

The optimal sampling ratio is proportional to the square root of this quantity. This article demonstrates that a misspecification of the ratio of the population variances can cause a substantial loss in power of the corresponding tests. As a robust alternative, a maximin approach is used to construct designs, which are efficient, whenever the experimenter is able to specify a specific region for the ratio of the population variances. The advantages of the robust designs for inference in the Behrens-Fisher problem are illustrated in a simulation study and an application to the design of experiment for bioassay is presented.","Behrens-Fisher problem,bioassay,design of experiment,local optimal design,robust designs",,"Dette, H@Ruhr Univ Bochum, Fak Math, D-44780 Bochum, Germany@Loyola Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Chicago, IL 60626 USA::O'Brien, TE@Ruhr Univ Bochum, Fak Math, D-44780 Bochum, Germany@Loyola Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Chicago, IL 60626 USA","Dette, H@Ruhr University Bochum@Loyola University Chicago::O'Brien, TE@Ruhr University Bochum@Loyola University Chicago",not exist,"WELCH APPROXIMATE SOLUTION FOR THE BEHRENS-FISHER PROBLEM+BEST, DJ; RAYNER, JCW+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 1987::LOCALLY OPTIMAL DESIGNS FOR ESTIMATING PARAMETERS+CHERNOFF, H+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1953::AN EXTENSION OF WELCHS APPROXIMATE T-SOLUTION TO COMPARATIVE BIOEQUIVALENCE TRIALS+DANNENBERG, O; DETTE, H; MUNK, A+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1994::Optimum allocation of treatments for Welch's test in equivalence assessment+Dette, H; Munk, A+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1997::Designing experiments with respect to 'standardized' optimality criteria+Dette, H+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1997::no title+Finney, D.+Statistical method in biological assay+1978::no title+GOVINDARAJULU Z+STAT TECHNIQUES BIOA+2000::Maximin designs for exponential growth models and heteroscedastic polynomial models+Imhof, LA+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2001::Practical solutions of the Behrens-Fisher problem+Scheffe, H.+J Am Statist Assoc+1970::no title+Staudte, RG; Sheather, SJ.+Robust Estimation &amp; Testing+1990::PROBABILITIES OF TYPE L ERRORS OF WELCH ESTS FOR BEHRENS-FISHER PRO BLEM+WANG, YY+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1971::The significance of the difference between two means when the population variances are unequal+Welch, BL+BIOMETRIKA+FEB 1938::no title+WELCH BL+J ROYAL STAT SOC S+1936"

Difficulties in drawing inferences with finite-mixture models: A simple example with a simple solution,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/0003130043286,MAY 2004,20,33,"Likelihood functions from finite mixture models have many unusual features. Maximum likelihood (ML) estimates may behave poorly over repeated samples, and the abnormal shape of the likelihood often makes it difficult to assess the uncertainty in parameter estimates. Bayesian inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) can be a useful alternative to ML, but the component labels may switch during the MCMC run, making the output difficult to interpret. Two basic methods for handling the label-switching problem have been proposed: imposing constraints on the parameter space and cluster-based relabeling of the simulated parameters. We have found that label switching may also be reduced by supplying small amounts of prior information that are asymmetric with respect to the mixture components. Simply assigning one observation to each component a priori may effectively eliminate the problem. Using a very simple example-a univariate sample from a mixture of two exponentials-we evaluate the performance of likelihood and MCMC-based estimates and intervals over repeated sampling. Our simulations show that MCMC performs much better than ML if the label-switching problem is adequately addressed, and that asymmetric prior information performs as well as or better than the other proposed methods.","EM algorithm,label switching,Markov chain Monte Carlo","POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTIONS,LIKELIHOOD","Chung, H@Penn State Univ, Dept Stat, University Pk, PA 16802 USA@Penn State Univ, Methodol Ctr, University Pk, PA 16802 USA::Loken, E@Penn State Univ, Dept Stat, University Pk, PA 16802 USA@Penn State Univ, Methodol Ctr, University Pk, PA 16802 USA::Schafer, JL@Penn State Univ, Dept Stat, University Pk, PA 16802 USA@Penn State Univ, Methodol Ctr, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Chung, H@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University::Loken, E@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University::Schafer, JL@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University",not exist,"ESTIMATION AND HYPOTHESIS-TESTING IN FINITE MIXTURE-MODELS+AITKIN, M; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1985::Markov chain Monte Carlo method and its application+Brooks, SP+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES D-THE STATISTICIAN+1998::Computational and inferential difficulties with mixture posterior distributions.+Celeux, G; Hurn, M; Robert, CP+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2000::Bayesian inference for mixtures: the label-switching problem+Celeux, G.+COMPSTAT 98+1998::no title+CHUNG H+THESIS PENNSYLVANIA+2003::Markov chain Monte Carlo convergence diagnostics: A comparative review+Cowles, MK; Carlin, BP+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1996::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::SAMPLING-BASED APPROACHES TO CALCULATING MARGINAL DENSITIES+GELFAND, AE; SMITH, AFM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1990::EXPLORATORY LATENT STRUCTURE-ANALYSIS USING BOTH IDENTIFIABLE AND UNIDENTIFIABLE MODELS+GOODMAN, LA+BIOMETRIKA+1974::no title+Little, R.

Biases in SPSS 12.0 missing value analysis,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/0003130043204,MAY 2004,15,44,"In addition to SPSS Base software, SPSS Inc. sells a number of add-on packages, including a package called Missing Value Analysis (MVA). In version 12.0, MVA offers four general methods for analyzing data with missing values. Unfortunately, none of these methods is wholly satisfactory when values are missing at random. The first two methods, listwise and pairwise deletion, are well known to be biased. The third method, regression imputation, uses a regression model to impute missing values, but the regression parameters are biased because they are derived using pairwise deletion. The final method, expectation maximization (EM), produces asymptotically unbiased estimates, but EM's implementation in MVA is limited to point estimates (without standard errors) of means, variances, and covariances. MVA can also impute values using the EM algorithm, but values are imputed without residual variation, so analyses that use the imputed values can be biased.","EM algorithm,ignorable missingness,imputation,maximum likelihood,missing at random,missing data,missing values,multiple imputation,nonignorable missingness","MULTIPLE IMPUTATION,MISSING DATA,REGRESSION","von Hippel, PT@Ohio State Univ, Dept Sociol & Intitiat Populat Res, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","von Hippel, PT@Ohio State University",not exist,"no title+Allison, P.+Missing data+2002::Multiple imputation for missing data - A cautionary tale+Allison, PD+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS &amp; RESEARCH+FEB 2000::Full information estimation in the presence of incomplete data.+Arbuckle, J.

Teaching statistical computing at North Carolina State University,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/0003130042881,FEB 2004,1,5,"The diverse topics that make up statistical computing present a challenge for constructing the appropriate courses in statistics curricula. An undergraduate course covering programming and data management prepares students for most statistics courses. However, many graduate students successfully learn these skills on their own; moreover, squeezing such a skills course into the master's program is difficult. We teach most of the topical statistical software in the courses that use them. For doctoral students, the issue becomes one of requirements and electives: some computing topics should be covered in the required courses, others are left to an elective. The selection and placement of these topics depend of the research program of the department. Even for an elective course, the research needs drive the choice of topics, although experience has shown that there can be no substitute for a good foundation in arithmetic and numerical linear algebra.","graduate curriculum,statistical computing",,"Monahan, J@N Carolina State Univ, Dept Stat, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Monahan, J@North Carolina State University@University of North Carolina",not exist,"no title+Monahan, J.

Separate and joint modeling of longitudinal and event time data using standard computer packages,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/0003130042854,FEB 2004,13,146,"Many clinical trials and other medical and reliability studies generate both longitudinal (repeated measurement) and survival (time to event) data. Many well-established methods exist for analyzing such data separately, but these may be inappropriate when the longitudinal variable is correlated with patient health status, hence the survival endpoint (as well as the possibility of study dropout). To remedy this, an earlier article proposed a joint model for longitudinal and survival data, obtaining maximum likelihood estimates via the EM algorithm. The longitudinal and survival responses are assumed independent given a linking latent bivariate Gaussian process and available covariates. We develop a fully Bayesian version of this approach, implemented via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We use the approach to jointly model the longitudinal and survival data from an AIDS clinical trial comparing two treatments, didanosine (ddI) and zalcitabine (ddC). Despite the complexity of the model, we find it to be relatively straightforward to implement and understand using the WinBUGS software. Wee compare our results to those obtained from readily available alternatives in SAS Procs MIXED, NLMIXED, PHREG, and LIFEREG, as well as Bayesian analogues of these traditional separate likelihood methods. The joint Bayesian approach appears to offer significantly improved and enhanced estimation of median survival times and other parameters of interest, as well as simpler coding and comparable runtimes.","Bayesian approach,joint model,longitudinal data,Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC),SAS,survival data,WinBUGS","INFECTION,SURVIVAL,ERROR,AIDS","Guo, X@Biostat Affymetrix Inc, Santa Clara, CA 95051 USA@Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Biostat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA::Carlin, BP@Biostat Affymetrix Inc, Santa Clara, CA 95051 USA@Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Biostat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Guo, X@Affymetrix@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities::Carlin, BP@Affymetrix@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities",not exist,"A COMPARATIVE TRIAL OF DIDANOSINE OR ZALCITABINE AFTER TREATMENT WITH ZIDOVUDINE IN PATIENTS WITH HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS INFECTION+ABRAMS, DI; GOLDMAN, AI; LAUNER, C; et al.+NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE+MAR 10 1994::no title+Carlin, BP; Louis, TA.+Bayes and Empirical Bayes Methods for Data Analysis+2000::no title+Cox, DR; Oakes, D.+Analysis of survival data+1984::no title+Gelman, A.

A tutorial on MM algorithms,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/0003130042836,FEB 2004,39,535,"Most problems in frequentist statistics involve optimization of a function such as a likelihood or a sum of squares. EM algorithms are among the most effective algorithms for maximum likelihood estimation because they consistently drive the likelihood uphill by maximizing a simple surrogate function for the log-likelihood. Iterative optimization of a surrogate function as exemplified by an EM algorithm does not necessarily require missing data. Indeed, every EM algorithm is a special case of the more general class of MM optimization algorithms, which typically exploit convexity rather than missing data in majorizing or minorizing an objective function. In our opinion, MM algorithms deserve to be part of the standard toolkit of professional statisticians. This article explains the principle behind MM algorithms, suggests some methods for constructing them, and discusses some of their attractive features. We include numerous examples throughout the article to illustrate the concepts described. In addition to surveying previous work on MM algorithms, this article introduces some new material on constrained optimization and standard error estimation.","constrained optimization,EM algorithm,majorization,minorization,Newton-Raphson","SURROGATE OBJECTIVE FUNCTIONS,EM ALGORITHM,LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,REGRESSION,MINIMIZATION,ACCELERATION,TOMOGRAPHY,MATRIX,MODEL","Hunter, DR@Penn State Univ, Dept Stat, University Pk, PA 16802 USA@Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Biomath, Los Angeles, CA USA@Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Human Genet, Los Angeles, CA USA::Lange, K@Penn State Univ, Dept Stat, University Pk, PA 16802 USA@Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Biomath, Los Angeles, CA USA@Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Human Genet, Los Angeles, CA USA","Hunter, DR@Penn State University@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@University of California Los Angeles@University of California System@University of California System@University of California Los Angeles::Lange, K@Penn State University@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@University of California Los Angeles@University of California System@University of California System@University of California Los Angeles",not exist,"EM algorithms without missing data.+Becker, M P; Yang, I; Lange, K+Statistical methods in medical research+1997-Mar::FITTING LONGITUDINAL REDUCED-RANK REGRESSION-MODELS BY ALTERNATING LEAST-SQUARES+BIJLEVELD, CCJH; DELEEUW, J+PSYCHOMETRIKA+SEP 1991::MONOTONICITY OF QUADRATIC-APPROXIMATION ALGORITHMS+BOHNING, D; LINDSAY, BG+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+1988::PROXIMAL MINIMIZATION ALGORITHM WITH D-FUNCTIONS+CENSOR, Y; ZENIOS, SA+JOURNAL OF OPTIMIZATION THEORY AND APPLICATIONS+JUN 1992::Block-relaxation algorithms in statistics+de Leeuw, J.+Information Systems and Data Analysis+1994::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::A MODIFIED EXPECTATION MAXIMIZATION ALGORITHM FOR PENALIZED LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION IN EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY+DEPIERRO, AR+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING+MAR 1995::no title+GROENEN PJF+MAJORIZATION APPROAC+1993::Convergence of correction matrix algorithms for multidimensional scaling+Heiser, W.

Our analysis of professional bowling indicates that, for many bowlers, the probability of rolling a strike is not independent of previous outcomes and the number of strikes rolled varies more across games than can be explained by chance alone. For example, most bowlers have a higher strike proportion after J consecutive strikes than after j consecutive nonstrikes, and this difference becomes more pronounced as j increases. from 1 to 4.","bowling,self-efficacy",,"Dorsey-Palmateer, R@Pomona Coll, Dept Econ, Claremont, CA 91711 USA::Smith, G@Pomona Coll, Dept Econ, Claremont, CA 91711 USA","Dorsey-Palmateer, R@Pomona College::Smith, G@Pomona College","Smith, Gary@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5173-2741","SOME EXACT CONDITIONAL TESTS OF INDEPENDENCE FOR RXC CROSS-CLASSIFICATION TABLES+AGRESTI, A; WACKERLY, D+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1977::ON THE POWER FUNCTION OF THE LONGEST RUN AS A TEST FOR RANDOMNESS IN A SEQUENCE OF ALTERNATIVES+BATEMAN, G+BIOMETRIKA+1948::no title+FRAME D+RUNS REGIMES RATIONA+2003::THE HOT HAND IN BASKETBALL - ON THE MISPERCEPTION OF RANDOM SEQUENCES+GILOVICH, T; VALLONE, R; TVERSKY, A+COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY+1985::Horseshoe pitchers' hot hands+Smith, G+PSYCHONOMIC BULLETIN &amp; REVIEW+SEP 2003::Distribution of groups in a sequence of alternatives+Stevens, WL+ANNALS OF EUGENICS+JAN 1939::The cold facts about the hot hand in basketball+Tversky, A.; Gilovich, T.+Chance+1989::The hot hand: Statistical reality or cognitive illusion?+Tversky, A.; Gilovich, T.+Chance+1989::no title+WARDROP RL+STAT TEST HOT HAND B+1999::INDIVIDUAL COMPARISONS BY RANKING METHODS+WILCOXON, F+BIOMETRICS BULLETIN+1945"

The ISU proposed a stricter ethics code for the judges and changes to the decision rule. Unfortunately, the new decision rule is no better than the previous rule in countering manipulation. In this article, we construct an alternative rule and show that, under reasonable assumptions, our rule is more robust against manipulation than existing rules. When other properties such as Condorcet efficiency, frequency of ties, and violation of monotonicity are compared, our rule is also more desirable. In addition, a commonly used rank sum rule is examined and shown to be even worse than the other rules.

In addition, we introduce and estimate a multilevel hierarchical model to determine those school districts and counties that demonstrated the best performance over the 2000-2001 period.","Bayes,MCMC,school performance",SELECTION,"Tobias, JL@Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697 USA","Tobias, JL@University of California Irvine@University of California System",not exist,"no title+Carlin, BP; Louis, TA.+Bayes and Empirical Bayes Methods for Data Analysis+2000::EXPLAINING THE GIBBS SAMPLER+CASELLA, G; GEORGE, EI+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 1992::no title+CHIB S+SEMIPARAMETRIC HIERA+2003::Markov chain Monte Carlo methods: computation and inference+Chib, S.+HDB ECONOMETRICS+2001::no title+Denison, D.; Holmes, C.; Mallick, B.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Smith, A</span>.+Bayesian Methods for Nonlinear Classification and Regression+2002::Automatic Bayesian curve fitting+Denison, DGT; Mallick, BK; Smith, AFM+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1998::no title+DINARDO J+J ECON PERSPECT+2001::no title+Fan, J.; Gijbels, I.+Local Polynomial Modelling and Its Applications+1996::Benchmark priors for Bayesian model averaging+Fernandez, C; Ley, E; Steel, MFJ+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+FEB 2001::no title+Gelman, A.

First significant digit patterns from mixtures of uniform distributions,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/0003130042782,FEB 2004,15,12,"Traditional tests searching for human influence in data assume that, barring such influence, first significant digits (FSD) are uniformly distributed. More recent tests rely on Benford's law, postulating that lower digits are more likely than higher ones. I show that both patterns belong to a family arising from mixtures of uniforms, and characterize the FSD patterns for a one-parameter subset of the family. I also show that all family members exhibit decreasing FSD probabilities. The empirical analysis suggests that although the uniform FSD pattern and Benford's law are reasonable models for some data, alternative family members better fit other data.","Benford's law,Stigler's law","PSYCHOLOGICAL BARRIERS,BENFORDS LAW,NUMBERS","Rodriguez, RJ@Univ Miami, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA","Rodriguez, RJ@University of Miami",not exist,"The law of anomalous numbers+Benford, F.+Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society+1938::ANOMALIES IN INCOME NUMBERS - EVIDENCE OF GOAL ORIENTED BEHAVIOR+CARSLAW, CAPN+ACCOUNTING REVIEW+APR 1988::On the Hypothesis of Psychological Barriers in Stock Markets and Benford's Law+Ceuster De, M.

Teaching statistical principles using epidemiology: Measuring the health of populations,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/0003130042791,FEB 2004,83,2,"Recent developments in education have addressed the need to expand and enhance the teaching of statistics and mathematics throughout education (K-16) to improve the statistical literacy and scientific reasoning of students. Nonetheless, many students perceive the statistics instruction contained in mathematics and science courses as unrelated to decisions in their lives, and data show that students in the United States lag behind students in other parts of the world in mathematics and science achievement. In this article we argue that epidemiology, the scientific basis for public health, provides a useful and motivating context for teaching statistical principles and methods and suggest that examples from this and other public health sciences be used in the teaching, of mathematics and science courses in high school and college. First, we describe resources developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to aid in implementing epidemiology in statistics education, and present evaluative evidence of the effectiveness of these resources when implemented at the high school level. Next, we illustrate how these resources address selected college mathematics and high school statistics education standards. Finally, we show how teaching statistics in the context of epidemiology responds directly to several current initiatives in statistics and mathematics education.","electronic teaching materials,numeracy,public health,quantitative literacy,statistical education","AIDS PROJECTIONS,THINKING,LITERACY,NUMERACY,INQUIRY,FARR","Stroup, DF@Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Ctr Chron Dis Prevent & Hlth Promot, Atlanta, GA 30341 USA@Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Publ Hlth Law Program, Atlanta, GA 30341 USA@Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Off Sci Educ, Atlanta, GA 30341 USA@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA::Goodman, RA@Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Ctr Chron Dis Prevent & Hlth Promot, Atlanta, GA 30341 USA@Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Publ Hlth Law Program, Atlanta, GA 30341 USA@Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Off Sci Educ, Atlanta, GA 30341 USA@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA::Cordell, R@Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Ctr Chron Dis Prevent & Hlth Promot, Atlanta, GA 30341 USA@Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Publ Hlth Law Program, Atlanta, GA 30341 USA@Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Off Sci Educ, Atlanta, GA 30341 USA@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA::Scheaffer, R@Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Ctr Chron Dis Prevent & Hlth Promot, Atlanta, GA 30341 USA@Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Publ Hlth Law Program, Atlanta, GA 30341 USA@Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Off Sci Educ, Atlanta, GA 30341 USA@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Stroup, DF@Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA@Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA@Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA@State University System of Florida@University of Florida::Goodman, RA@Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA@Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA@Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA@State University System of Florida@University of Florida::Cordell, R@Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA@Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA@Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA@State University System of Florida@University of Florida::Scheaffer, R@Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA@Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA@Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA@State University System of Florida@University of Florida",not exist,"no title+*AMST NEWS+AMST NEWS        MAY+2003::AIDS PROJECTIONS - HOW FARR OUT+ARTZROUNI, M+JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 5 1990::no title+BAILEY NTJ+STATISTICIAN+1985::Statistics for homeland defense+Banks, D.

A potential for bias when rounding in multiple imputation,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/0003130032314,NOV 2003,9,113,"With the advent of general purpose packages that support multiple imputation for analyzing datasets with missing data (e.g., Solas, SAS PROC MI. and S-Plus 6.0), we expect much greater use of multiple imputation in the future. For simplicity, some imputation packages assume the joint distribution of the variables in the multiple imputation model is multivariate normal, and impute the missing data from the conditional normal distribution for the missing data given the observed data. If the possibly missing data are not multivariate normal (say, binary), imputing a normal random variable can yield implausible values. To circumvent this problem, a number of methods have been developed, including rounding the imputed normal to the closest observed value in the dataset. We show that this rounding can cause biased estimates of parameters, whereas if the imputed value is not rounded, no bias would occur. This article shows that rounding should not be used indiscriminately, and thus some caution should be exercised when rounding imputed values, particularly for dichotomous variables.","fully normal imputation,missing completely at random,missing data",,"Horton, NJ@Smith Coll, Dept Math, Northampton, MA 01063 USA@Med Univ S Carolina, Dept Biometry & Epidemiol, Charleston, SC 29425 USA@Emory Univ, Goizueta Business Sch, Dept Decis & Informat Anal, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA::Lipsitz, SR@Smith Coll, Dept Math, Northampton, MA 01063 USA@Med Univ S Carolina, Dept Biometry & Epidemiol, Charleston, SC 29425 USA@Emory Univ, Goizueta Business Sch, Dept Decis & Informat Anal, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA::Parzen, M@Smith Coll, Dept Math, Northampton, MA 01063 USA@Med Univ S Carolina, Dept Biometry & Epidemiol, Charleston, SC 29425 USA@Emory Univ, Goizueta Business Sch, Dept Decis & Informat Anal, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA","Horton, NJ@Smith College@Medical University of South Carolina@Emory University::Lipsitz, SR@Smith College@Medical University of South Carolina@Emory University::Parzen, M@Smith College@Medical University of South Carolina@Emory University","Horton, Nicholas@A-2493-2008@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3332-4311","no title+Little, R.

Raindrop plots: A new way to display collections of likelihoods and distributions,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/0003130032369,NOV 2003,23,11,"In a variety of settings, it is desirable to display a collection of likelihoods over a common interval. One approach is simply to superimpose the likelihood curves. However, where there are more than a handful of curves, such displays are extremely difficult to decipher. An alternative is simply to display a point estimate with a confidence interval, corresponding to each likelihood. However, these may be inadequate when the likelihood is not approximately normal, as can occur with small sample sizes or nonlinear models. A second dimension is needed to gauge the relative plausibility of different parameter values. We introduce the raindrop plot, a shaded figure over the range of parameter values having log-likelihood greater than some cutoff, with height varying proportional to the difference between the log-likelihood and the cutoff. In the case of a normal likelihood, this produces a reflected parabola so that deviations from normality can be easily detected. An analogue of the raindrop plot can also be used to display estimated random effect distributions, posterior distributions, and predictive distributions.","likelihood interval,log odds ratio,meta-analysis,nonlinear model,nonnormality,variable-height plot","EMPIRICAL BAYES METHODS,COMBINING LIKELIHOODS","Barrowman, NJ@Childrens Hosp Eastern Ontario, Inst Res, Chalmers Res Grp, Ottawa, ON K1H 8L1, Canada@Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada::Myers, RA@Childrens Hosp Eastern Ontario, Inst Res, Chalmers Res Grp, Ottawa, ON K1H 8L1, Canada@Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada","Barrowman, NJ@University of Ottawa@Dalhousie University::Myers, RA@University of Ottawa@Dalhousie University",not exist,"no title+Agresti,, A.+Categorical data analysis+1990::KURTOSIS - A CRITICAL-REVIEW+BALANDA, KP; MACGILLIVRAY, HL+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1988::Still more spawner-recruitment curves: the hockey stick and its generalizations+Barrowman, NJ; Myers, RA+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES+APR 2000::The variability among populations of coho salmon in the maximum reproductive rate and depensation+Barrowman, NJ; Myers, RA; Hilborn, R; et al.+ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS+JUN 2003::no title+Bates, DM; Watts, DG.+Nonlinear Regression Analysis and Its Applications+1988::no title+BOX, G.

Detecting dependence with Kendall plots,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/0003130032431,NOV 2003,20,49,"Earlier literature proposed a rank-based graphical tool called a chi-plot which, in conjunction with a traditional scatterplot of the raw data, can help detect the presence of association in a random sample from some continuous bivariate distribution. This article suggests an alternative display called a Kendall plot, or K-plot for short, which adapts the concept of probability plot to the detection of dependence. The new procedure, which is rooted in the probability integral transformation, retains the chi-plot's key property of invariance with respect to monotone transformations of the marginal distributions. K-plots are easier to interpret than chi-plots. however, because the curvature that they display in cases of association is related in a definite way to the copula characterizing the underlying dependence structure. In addition, K-plots have the advantage of being readily extendible to the multivariate context.","chi-plot,copula,Kendall's tau,nonparametric association,probability integral transformation,rankits,Spearman's rho","EXTREME-VALUE COPULAS,ARCHIMEDEAN COPULAS,TESTS,INDEPENDENCE,ASSOCIATION,INFERENCE,MODEL","Genest, C@Univ Laval, Dept Math & Stat, St Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada@Minist Revenu Quebec, Quebec City, PQ G1N 4V5, Canada::Boies, JC@Univ Laval, Dept Math & Stat, St Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada@Minist Revenu Quebec, Quebec City, PQ G1N 4V5, Canada","Genest, C@Laval University@Unknow::Boies, JC@Laval University@Unknow",not exist,"On Kendall's process+Barbe, P; Genest, C; Ghoudi, K; et al.+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+AUG 1996::A nonparametric estimation procedure for bivariate extreme value copulas+Caperaa, P; Fougeres, AL; Genest, C+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1997::A stochastic ordering based on a decomposition of Kendall's tau+Caperaa, P; Fougeres, AL; Genest, C+DISTRIBUTIONS WITH GIVEN MARGINALS AND MOMENT PROBLEMS+1997::Bivariate distributions with given extreme value attractor+Caperaa, P; Fougeres, AL; Genest, C+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+JAN 2000::MODEL FOR ASSOCIATION IN BIVARIATE LIFE TABLES AND ITS APPLICATION IN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL-STUDIES OF FAMILIAL TENDENCY IN CHRONIC DISEASE INCIDENCE+CLAYTON, DG+BIOMETRIKA+1978::Graphical assessment of dependence: Is a picture worth 100 tests?+Fisher, NI; Switzer, P+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 2001::CHI-PLOTS FOR ASSESSING DEPENDENCE+FISHER, NI; SWITZER, P+BIOMETRIKA+1985::no title+GARRALDAGUILLEM AI+C R ACAD SCI PARIS 1+2000::Tests of serial independence based on Kendall's process+Genest, C; Quessy, JF; Remillard, B+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+SEP 2002::ARCHIMEDEAN COPULAS AND FAMILIES OF BIDIMENSIONAL LAWS FOR WHICH THE MARGINALS ARE GIVEN+GENEST, C; MACKAY, RJ+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+JUN 1986::STATISTICAL-INFERENCE PROCEDURES FOR BIVARIATE ARCHIMEDEAN COPULAS+GENEST, C; RIVEST, LP+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1993::On the multivariate probability integral transformation+Genest, C; Rivest, LP+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+JUL 1 2001::Statistical properties of couples of bivariate extreme-value copulas+Ghoudi, K; Khoudraji, A; Rivest, LP+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+MAR 1998::Copula models for aggregating expert opinions+Jouini, MN; Clemen, RT+OPERATIONS RESEARCH+MAY-JUN 1996::Data-driven rank tests for independence+Kallenberg, WCM; Ledwina, T+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1999::no title+Nelsen, RB.+An introduction to copulas, volume 139 of Lecture Notes in Statistics+1999::SEMIPARAMETRIC INFERENCE IN A MODEL FOR ASSOCIATION IN BIVARIATE SURVIVAL-DATA+OAKES, D+BIOMETRIKA+AUG 1986::no title+Romano, JP; Siegel, AF.+Counterexamples in Probability and Statistics+1986::Fonctions de Reparition a n Dimensions et Leurs Marges+Sklar, A.+Publications de l'Intitut de Statistique de I'Universit de Paris+1959::PROBABILITY PLOTTING METHODS FOR ANALYSIS OF DATA+WILK, MB; GNANADES.R+BIOMETRIKA+1968"

We are not attempting to perform a controlled comparison of the algorithms in each package to decide which has the strongest predictive power, but instead hope to give an idea of the approach to predictive modeling used in each of them. The packages are compared in the areas of descriptive statistics and graphics, predictive models, and association (market basket) analysis.

As expected, the packages affiliated with the most popular statistical software packages (SAS and SPSS) provide the broadest range of features with remarkably similar modeling and interface approaches, whereas the other packages all have their special sets of features and specific target audiences whom we believe each of the packages will serve well. It is essential that an organization considering the purchase of a data mining package carefully evaluate the available options and choose the one that provides the best fit with its particular needs.","Clementine,Ghostminer,Quadstone,SAS,Enterprise Miner,XLMiner",,"Haughton, D@Bentley Coll, Data Anal Res Team, Waltham, MA 02452 USA@Bilkent Univ, Bilkent, Turkey::Deichmann, J@Bentley Coll, Data Anal Res Team, Waltham, MA 02452 USA@Bilkent Univ, Bilkent, Turkey::Eshghi, A@Bentley Coll, Data Anal Res Team, Waltham, MA 02452 USA@Bilkent Univ, Bilkent, Turkey::Sayek, S@Bentley Coll, Data Anal Res Team, Waltham, MA 02452 USA@Bilkent Univ, Bilkent, Turkey::Teebagy, N@Bentley Coll, Data Anal Res Team, Waltham, MA 02452 USA@Bilkent Univ, Bilkent, Turkey::Topi, H@Bentley Coll, Data Anal Res Team, Waltham, MA 02452 USA@Bilkent Univ, Bilkent, Turkey","Haughton, D@Unknow@Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University::Deichmann, J@Unknow@Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University::Eshghi, A@Unknow@Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University::Sayek, S@Unknow@Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University::Teebagy, N@Unknow@Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University::Topi, H@Unknow@Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University","Sayek, Selin@K-1294-2012::Topi, Heikki@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0600-2010","no title+Breiman, L; Friedman, J; Stone, CJ<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Olshen, RA</span>.+Classification and regression trees+1984::Application of multiple adaptive regression splines (MARS) in direct response modeling+Deichman, J.; Eshghi, A.; Sayek, S.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Teebagy, N</span>.+Journal of Interactive Marketing+2002::no title+Quinlan, R.+C4.5: Programs for Machine Learning+1993"

Small samples and ordered logistic regression: Does it help to collapse categories of outcome?,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/0003130031892,AUG 2003,18,16,"The logistic regression proportional odds model is popular for analyzing studies with an ordered categorical outcome. In contingency table analysis, from a Type I error perspective, it is often thought best to collapse categories with sparse cell counts to improve asymptotic approximations used for testing hypotheses. Moreover, in the proportional odds model, it is natural to collapse adjacent categories of outcome since the slope parameter remains unchanged. This article asks the question: Is it really beneficial to do so? Using simulations, we show that in small samples collapsing categories produces Wald tests that are too conservative. Our simulations indicate that this is mainly due to stochastic dependence between the numerator and the denominator of the Wald statistic.","cumulative logit,proportional odds model,Wald test",MODELS,"Murad, H@Sheba Med Ctr, Biostat Unit, Gertner Inst Epidemiol & Hlth Policy Res, IL-52621 Ramat Gan, Israel@Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Ramat Gan, Israel@Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, Sackler Fac Med, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel@Sheba Med Ctr, Canc Epidemiol Unit, Gertner Inst Epidemiol & Hlth Policy Res, IL-52621 Ramat Gan, Israel@Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Sch Med, Dept Epidemiol & Prevent Med, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel@Carmel Hosp, Dept Ophthalmol, Haifa, Israel::Fleischman, A@Sheba Med Ctr, Biostat Unit, Gertner Inst Epidemiol & Hlth Policy Res, IL-52621 Ramat Gan, Israel@Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Ramat Gan, Israel@Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, Sackler Fac Med, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel@Sheba Med Ctr, Canc Epidemiol Unit, Gertner Inst Epidemiol & Hlth Policy Res, IL-52621 Ramat Gan, Israel@Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Sch Med, Dept Epidemiol & Prevent Med, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel@Carmel Hosp, Dept Ophthalmol, Haifa, Israel::Sadetzki, S@Sheba Med Ctr, Biostat Unit, Gertner Inst Epidemiol & Hlth Policy Res, IL-52621 Ramat Gan, Israel@Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Ramat Gan, Israel@Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, Sackler Fac Med, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel@Sheba Med Ctr, Canc Epidemiol Unit, Gertner Inst Epidemiol & Hlth Policy Res, IL-52621 Ramat Gan, Israel@Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Sch Med, Dept Epidemiol & Prevent Med, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel@Carmel Hosp, Dept Ophthalmol, Haifa, Israel::Geyer, O@Sheba Med Ctr, Biostat Unit, Gertner Inst Epidemiol & Hlth Policy Res, IL-52621 Ramat Gan, Israel@Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Ramat Gan, Israel@Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, Sackler Fac Med, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel@Sheba Med Ctr, Canc Epidemiol Unit, Gertner Inst Epidemiol & Hlth Policy Res, IL-52621 Ramat Gan, Israel@Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Sch Med, Dept Epidemiol & Prevent Med, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel@Carmel Hosp, Dept Ophthalmol, Haifa, Israel::Freedman, LS@Sheba Med Ctr, Biostat Unit, Gertner Inst Epidemiol & Hlth Policy Res, IL-52621 Ramat Gan, Israel@Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Ramat Gan, Israel@Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, Sackler Fac Med, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel@Sheba Med Ctr, Canc Epidemiol Unit, Gertner Inst Epidemiol & Hlth Policy Res, IL-52621 Ramat Gan, Israel@Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Sch Med, Dept Epidemiol & Prevent Med, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel@Carmel Hosp, Dept Ophthalmol, Haifa, Israel","Murad, H@Chaim Sheba Medical Center@Bar Ilan University@Sackler Faculty of Medicine@Tel Aviv University@Chaim Sheba Medical Center@Sackler Faculty of Medicine@Tel Aviv University@Carmel Medical Center@Clalit Health Services::Fleischman, A@Chaim Sheba Medical Center@Bar Ilan University@Sackler Faculty of Medicine@Tel Aviv University@Chaim Sheba Medical Center@Sackler Faculty of Medicine@Tel Aviv University@Carmel Medical Center@Clalit Health Services::Sadetzki, S@Chaim Sheba Medical Center@Bar Ilan University@Sackler Faculty of Medicine@Tel Aviv University@Chaim Sheba Medical Center@Sackler Faculty of Medicine@Tel Aviv University@Carmel Medical Center@Clalit Health Services::Geyer, O@Chaim Sheba Medical Center@Bar Ilan University@Sackler Faculty of Medicine@Tel Aviv University@Chaim Sheba Medical Center@Sackler Faculty of Medicine@Tel Aviv University@Carmel Medical Center@Clalit Health Services::Freedman, LS@Chaim Sheba Medical Center@Bar Ilan University@Sackler Faculty of Medicine@Tel Aviv University@Chaim Sheba Medical Center@Sackler Faculty of Medicine@Tel Aviv University@Carmel Medical Center@Clalit Health Services",not exist,"no title+Agresti, A.+Analysis of Ordinal Categorical Data+1984::no title+ALTMAN DG+PRACTICAL STATISTICS+1991::Regression models for ordinal responses: A review of methods and applications+Ananth, CV; Kleinbaum, DG+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+DEC 1997::THE ORDERED LOGISTIC-REGRESSION MODEL IN PSYCHIATRY - RISING PREVALENCE OF DEMENTIA IN OLD PEOPLES HOMES+ASHBY, D; WEST, CR; AMES, D+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+NOV 1989::no title+*CYT SOFTW CORP+LOGXACT US GUID VERS+2000::Maternal substance use during pregnancy and developmental outcome at age three+Faden, VB; Graubard, BI+JOURNAL OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE+2000::no title+FEINBERG SE+ANAL CROSS CLASSIFIE+1980::ALTERNATIVE MODELS FOR ORDINAL LOGISTIC-REGRESSION+GREENLAND, S+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+AUG 30 1994::no title+HARRELL FE+REGRESSION MODELING+2000::WALDS TEST AS APPLIED TO HYPOTHESES IN LOGIT ANALYSIS+HAUCK, WW; DONNER, A+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1977::TRANSPUTER-BASED FAULT-TOLERANT AND FAIL-SAFE NODE FOR DUAL RING DISTRIBUTED RAILWAY SIGNALING SYSTEMS+KUMAR, KV; CHANDRA, V+MICROPROCESSORS AND MICROSYSTEMS+APR 1994::Dichotomous or categorical response?

Sample size: More than calculations,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/0003130031919,AUG 2003,14,19,"Conventionally, sample size calculations are viewed as calculations determining the right number of subjects needed for a study. Such calculations follow the classical paradigm: ""for a difference X, I need sample size Y."" We argue that the paradigm ""for a sample size Y, I get information Z"" is more appropriate for many studies and reflects the information needed by scientists when planning a study. This approach applies to both physiological studies and Phase I and 11 interventional studies. We provide actual examples from our own consulting work to demonstrate this. We conclude that sample size should be viewed not as a unique right number, but rather as a factor needed to assess the utility of a study.","accuracy,detectable difference,feasibility,precision,scientific thinking",,"Parker, RA@Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Biostat AIDS Res, Boston, MA 02115 USA@Univ Calif Los Angeles, Harbor Med Ctr, Torrance, CA 90509 USA@Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Biometr Ctr, Boston, MA 02215 USA::Berman, NG@Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Biostat AIDS Res, Boston, MA 02115 USA@Univ Calif Los Angeles, Harbor Med Ctr, Torrance, CA 90509 USA@Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Biometr Ctr, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Parker, RA@Harvard University@University of California Los Angeles@University of California System@University of California Los Angeles Medical Center@Harvard University::Berman, NG@Harvard University@University of California Los Angeles@University of California System@University of California Los Angeles Medical Center@Harvard University",not exist,"Peer review of statistics in medical research: the other problem+Bacchetti, P+BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL+MAY 25 2002::no title+Cohen, J.+Statistical power analysis for the behavioral sciences+1988::no title+Desu, MM; Raghavarao, D.+Sample size methodology+1990::no title+ELASHOFF JD+NQUERY ADVISOR RELEA+2000::no title+Hintze, J.+PASS 2000+2000::Some practical guidelines for effective sample size determination+Lenth, RV+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 2001::no title+LENTH RV+JAVA APPLETS POWER S+2003::no title+Murphy, K.; Myors, B.+Statistical power analysis+1998::no title+Odeh, R.

Confusion over measures of evidence (p's) versus errors (a's) in classical statistical testing,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/0003130031856,AUG 2003,47,104,"Confusion surrounding the reporting and interpretation of results of classical statistical tests is widespread among applied researchers, most of whom erroneously believe that such tests are prescribed by a single coherent theory of statistical inference. This is not the case: Classical statistical testing is an anonymous hybrid of the competing and frequently contradictory approaches formulated by R. A. Fisher on the one hand, and Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson on the other. In particular, there is a widespread failure to appreciate the incompatibility of Fisher's evidential p value with the Type I error rate, a, of NeymanPearson statistical orthodoxy. The distinction between evidence (p's) and error (a's) is not trivial. Instead, it reflects the fundamental differences between Fisher's ideas on significance testing and inductive inference, and Neyman-Pearson's views on hypothesis testing and inductive behavior. The emphasis of the article is to expose this incompatibility, but we also briefly note a possible reconciliation.","conditional error probabilities,Fisher,hypothesis test,Neyman-Pearson,p values,significance test","POINT NULL HYPOTHESIS,VALUES,IRRECONCILABILITY,INFERENCE,THOUGHTS","Hubbard, R@Drake Univ, Coll Business & Publ Adm, Des Moines, IA 50311 USA@Univ Valencia, Dept Stat & Operat Res, E-46100 Valencia, Spain::Bayarri, MJ@Drake Univ, Coll Business & Publ Adm, Des Moines, IA 50311 USA@Univ Valencia, Dept Stat & Operat Res, E-46100 Valencia, Spain","Hubbard, R@Unknow@University of Valencia::Bayarri, MJ@Unknow@University of Valencia",not exist,"P values for composite null models+Bayarri, MJ; Berger, JO+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2000::no title+Berger, J.+Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis+1985::Objective Bayesian methods for model selection: introduction and comparison+Berger, J.

The motivation for this article came from recollections of a 15-year-old conversation with Ingram Olkin where the problem at hand was how to model multivariate data with fixed marginals but with a flexible and rich multivariate structure.","kernel,parametric start,penalized likelihood,semiparametric",,"Spiegelman, C@Texas A&M Univ, Texas Transportat Inst, College Stn, TX 77843 USA@Texas A&M Univ Syst, Texas Transportat Inst, College Stn, TX 77843 USA::Park, ES@Texas A&M Univ, Texas Transportat Inst, College Stn, TX 77843 USA@Texas A&M Univ Syst, Texas Transportat Inst, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Spiegelman, C@Texas A&M University College Station@Texas A&M University System@Texas A&M University College Station@Texas A&M University System::Park, ES@Texas A&M University College Station@Texas A&M University System@Texas A&M University College Station@Texas A&M University System","Park, Eun Sug@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6224-7007","Data sharpening for nonparametric inference subject to constraints+Braun, WJ; Hall, P+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+DEC 2001::MEAN-SQUARE ERROR OF BAHADURS ORDER-STATISTIC APPROXIMATION+DUTTWEIL.DL+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1973::NONPARAMETRIC DENSITY-ESTIMATION WITH A PARAMETRIC START+HJORT, NL; GLAD, IK+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 1995::no title+HJORT NL+NONPARAMETRIC DENSIT+1994::no title+JONES MC+AUSTR J STAT+1993::ON BAHADURS REPRESENTATION OF SAMPLE QUANTILES+KIEFER, J+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1967::A SEMIPARAMETRIC APPROACH TO DENSITY-ESTIMATION+OLKIN, I; SPIEGELMAN, CH+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1987::PARAMETRIC NONPARAMETRIC MIXTURE DENSITY-ESTIMATION WITH APPLICATION TO FLOOD-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS+SCHUSTER, E; YAKOWITZ, S+WATER RESOURCES BULLETIN+OCT 1985::no title+Scott, D.W.+Multivariate density estimation. theory, Practice and Visualization+1992::no title+Silverman, B.W.+Density Estimation for Statistics and Data Analysis+1986::no title+Simonoff, J.

A diamond-shaped equiponderant graphical display of the effects of two categorical predictors on continuous outcomes,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/0003130031883,AUG 2003,12,10,"Three-dimensional (3-D) bar graphs and their cur-rent 2-D alternatives have certain limitations when the primary objective is to provide an equal representation of the effects of two predictors on an outcome. This article proposes a graphing methodology (in the shape of a diamond) that projects 3-D bar graphs into 2-D whereby the third dimension is replaced with a polygon whose area and middle vertical and horizontal lengths represent the outcome. The proposed graphical representation is invariant to rotations and avoids outcomes in categories being concealed by others. This article shows several applications of our proposal to a variety of data types (e.g., proportions, incidence rates, relative risks), which can be easily implemented with available software.","epidemiology,graphical methods,statistics,three-dimensional bar graphs,two-dimensional projections",RISK,"Li, XH@Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA@Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biostat & Med Informat, Madison, WI 53726 USA@Univ Texas, Sch Publ Hlth, El Paso, TX 79902 USA::Buechner, JM@Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA@Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biostat & Med Informat, Madison, WI 53726 USA@Univ Texas, Sch Publ Hlth, El Paso, TX 79902 USA::Tarwater, PM@Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA@Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biostat & Med Informat, Madison, WI 53726 USA@Univ Texas, Sch Publ Hlth, El Paso, TX 79902 USA::Munoz, A@Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA@Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biostat & Med Informat, Madison, WI 53726 USA@Univ Texas, Sch Publ Hlth, El Paso, TX 79902 USA","Li, XH@Johns Hopkins University@Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health@University of Wisconsin Madison@University of Wisconsin System@University of Texas System@University of Texas El Paso::Buechner, JM@Johns Hopkins University@Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health@University of Wisconsin Madison@University of Wisconsin System@University of Texas System@University of Texas El Paso::Tarwater, PM@Johns Hopkins University@Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health@University of Wisconsin Madison@University of Wisconsin System@University of Texas System@University of Texas El Paso::Munoz, A@Johns Hopkins University@Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health@University of Wisconsin Madison@University of Wisconsin System@University of Texas System@University of Texas El Paso",not exist,"The visual design and control of trellis display+Becker, RA; Cleveland, WS; Shyu, M-J.+J Comput Graph Stat+1996::Graphical perception: Theory, experimentation, and application to the development of graphical methods+Cleveland, W.

A. Oster in which StatXact, LogXact, and Stata were examined. In most cases, comparing software packages on their main features, such as accuracy, user friendliness, and adequate documentation, is sufficient for giving the reader interesting and useful information. In some instances, however, one has to take a different perspective for discovering the mechanism behind discrepancies. An excellent software package, using accurate computations and ample documentation, may nevertheless not do what its menu implies. The case of the logrank test in StatXact is a good example, illustrating the need to always check procedures and formulas against labels and names.","exact statistical methods,exponential scores test,nonparametric test,savage test",,"Callaert, H@Limburgs Univ Centrum, Ctr Stat, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium","Callaert, H@Hasselt University",not exist,"no title+Cox, DR; Oakes, D.+Analysis of survival data+1984::no title+*CYTEL SOFTW CORP+STATXACT 5 US MAN+2001::no title+Kalbfleisch, J.

Promoting statistical thinking among secondary school students in the national context,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/0003130031432,MAY 2003,8,3,"Although secondary school students in many countries (like Ireland) get a limited and basic introduction to statistics, it is often of a mechanical nature with little or no emphasis on data analysis and practical examples. These students rarely see the applicability and challenging nature of statistical thinking. Statisticians need to promote these aspects of statistics to students, their teachers, and the public at large. The use of examples of a local (often a national) nature is encouraged in order to emphasize the relevance of statistical thinking. Several examples are discussed which have been successfully used in the Irish context, and which have analogues in other countries.","ages and gender of public representatives,back-to-back stem-and-leaf-plots,boxplots,daily births,exam cheating,forensic evidence,lotto",,"Boland, PJ@Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Dublin, Acturial & Financial Studies Degree Programme, Dublin 4, Ireland","Boland, PJ@University College Dublin",not exist,"no title+BOLAND PJ+CHANCE NEW DIRECTION+1990::no title+BOLAND PJ+CREATORS MATH IRISH+2000::no title+BOLAND PJ+EXPANDING NETWORK P+1998::no title+BOLAND PJ+J STAT ED+1999::Conference on applied statistics in Ireland - 1994 - Foreword+Boland, PJ; Pawitan, Y+STATISTICIAN+1996::no title+BROWN R+MATH TEACHER+1990::no title+BURRILL G+STATS+1994::no title+SIEGRIEST K+INTERACTIVE PROBABIL+1996"
The getting of wisdom: Educating statisticians to enhance their clients' numeracy,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/0003130031478,MAY 2003,22,4,"One often hears that ""data are not information, information is not knowledge, knowledge is not wisdom."" But what will turn data into information, information into knowledge, and knowledge into wisdom? The first two facets of this question are what motivate the description and inference topics in every statistics course. The third facet, the getting of wisdom, progresses as the student's understanding of these topics grows in depth, realism, and resilience, yet its importance is often underrated in statistics courses. Crucial to the getting of wisdom is a competence to argue back to a statistic and to criticize a statistical argument. Imparting this competence should be a vital concern in designing the course syllabus. By adding a little to the syllabus, such a course can also aid the statistician later to open up for his/her client the client's own path to statistical knowledge and wisdom. This can be valuable for advancing numeracy in our alarmingly innumerate society.","statistical literacy,statistical misconceptions,statistical reasoning,statistics and society,teaching statistics,the statistician in the community",,"Sowey, ER@Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia","Sowey, ER@University of New South Wales Sydney",not exist,"no title+Best, J.+Damned Lies and Statistics: Untangling Numbers From the Media, Politicians, and Activists+2001::The role of statistics and the statistician+Billard, L+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+NOV 1998::no title+Boen, J.

Type I error inflation in the presence of a ceiling effect,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/0003130031450,MAY 2003,35,38,"Many variables in biomedical research (e.g., indices of health status) are measured with ceiling effects, in which a substantial number of subjects attain the highest possible scale value because the scale only discriminates among individuals in the low to moderate range. Furthermore, in social surveys, variables such as income and alcohol consumption may be subject to ceiling effects to protect the privacy and identity of those at the upper end of the distribution for a given variable. This article shows that if one attempts to control for such a variable using ordinary linear regression, and then test another independent variable that is actually unrelated to the outcome, the result can be an increase in the rate of Type I Error (false significance). We present simulations in which standard tests conducted at the 5% significance level actually have the Type I error rates approaching 100% for large samples. Statistical solutions are explored, but the best recommendation is to construct scales that are not subject to ceiling effects.","censored independent variable,health status,Monte Carlo simulations,regression models","POPULATION HEALTH SURVEY,REGRESSION-MODELS,EM ALGORITHM,TOBIT-MODEL,RESOURCES","Austin, PC@Inst Clin Evaluat Sci, Toronto, ON M4N 3M5, Canada@Univ Toronto, Dept Stat, Toronto, ON M5G 3G3, Canada::Brunner, LJ@Inst Clin Evaluat Sci, Toronto, ON M4N 3M5, Canada@Univ Toronto, Dept Stat, Toronto, ON M5G 3G3, Canada","Austin, PC@University of Toronto@University of Toronto::Brunner, LJ@University of Toronto@University of Toronto",not exist,"no title+Arnold, S.

In many problems, however, predictive accuracy matters more in some parts of the data space than in others, and it is appropriate to aim for greater model effectiveness in those regions. If the relevant parts of the space depend on the use to which the model is to be put, then the best model will depend also on this intended use.

Exact confidence intervals for nonconstant effects by inverting the signed rank test,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/0003130031405,MAY 2003,18,15,"Wilcoxon's signed rank test is often inverted, using Walsh averages, to yield exact, distribution free, randomization based confidence intervals for a constant treatment effect or center of symmetry; however, many treatment effects are not constant, so that this interval is not applicable. This article proposes a new way to invert the signed rank test, again using Walsh averages, to produce an exact, distribution free, randomization based confidence interval describing treatment effects that are not constant. The procedure is simple to apply, comparable to the signed rank test itself. Also, the procedure permits a sensitivity analysis in observational studies that estimate treatment effects in the absence of randomization. The method is illustrated using an observational study of the frequency of micronuclei in the cells of alcoholics and matched controls.","observational study,permutation test,randomized experiment,sensitivity analysis,Walsh average",,"Rosenbaum, PR@Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Dept Stat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Rosenbaum, PR@University of Pennsylvania","Rosenbaum, Paul@H-8687-2012","SMOKING AND LUNG CANCER - RECENT EVIDENCE AND A DISCUSSION OF SOME QUESTIONS+CORNFIELD, J; HAENSZEL, W; HAMMOND, EC; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE+1959::no title+Cox, DR.+Planning of experiments+1958::no title+Fisher, R.

Reliability of the uncertified ballots in the 2000 presidential election in Florida,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/0003130031144,FEB 2003,12,4,"Following one of the most closely contested elections in American history, a group of the nation's largest media organizations retained the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) to conduct an in-depth inventory of all uncounted ballots from the 2000 presidential race in Florida. This article describes the planning and implementation of the project and its resulting databases. The State of Florida employed three major voting systems for the election: two systems based on punch cards, and various optical scanning systems. We analyze and present statistics regarding the reliability of the various voting systems. Although none are perfect, we generally found optical scanning to be superior to the punch card systems. We summarize analyses of project databases conducted by the Media Group with respect to new vote totals that hypothetically might have been achieved had the U.S. Supreme Court not stopped the vote counting. We offer recommendations to policy makers for future elections.","agreement,Bush,coding,consistency,Gore,multilevel models",,"Wolter, K@Iowa State Univ, Interdisciplinary Res Inst Survey Sci, Ames, IA 50011 USA@Univ Chicago, Argonne Natl Lab, Chicago, IL 60637 USA@Natl Opinion Res Ctr, Washington, DC USA@Univ Chicago, Irving B Harris Grad Sch Publ Policy Studies, Chicago, IL 60637 USA::Jergovic, D@Iowa State Univ, Interdisciplinary Res Inst Survey Sci, Ames, IA 50011 USA@Univ Chicago, Argonne Natl Lab, Chicago, IL 60637 USA@Natl Opinion Res Ctr, Washington, DC USA@Univ Chicago, Irving B Harris Grad Sch Publ Policy Studies, Chicago, IL 60637 USA::Moore, W@Iowa State Univ, Interdisciplinary Res Inst Survey Sci, Ames, IA 50011 USA@Univ Chicago, Argonne Natl Lab, Chicago, IL 60637 USA@Natl Opinion Res Ctr, Washington, DC USA@Univ Chicago, Irving B Harris Grad Sch Publ Policy Studies, Chicago, IL 60637 USA::Murphy, J@Iowa State Univ, Interdisciplinary Res Inst Survey Sci, Ames, IA 50011 USA@Univ Chicago, Argonne Natl Lab, Chicago, IL 60637 USA@Natl Opinion Res Ctr, Washington, DC USA@Univ Chicago, Irving B Harris Grad Sch Publ Policy Studies, Chicago, IL 60637 USA::O'Muircheartaigh, C@Iowa State Univ, Interdisciplinary Res Inst Survey Sci, Ames, IA 50011 USA@Univ Chicago, Argonne Natl Lab, Chicago, IL 60637 USA@Natl Opinion Res Ctr, Washington, DC USA@Univ Chicago, Irving B Harris Grad Sch Publ Policy Studies, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Wolter, K@Iowa State University@Argonne National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)@University of Chicago@Unknow@University of Chicago::Jergovic, D@Iowa State University@Argonne National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)@University of Chicago@Unknow@University of Chicago::Moore, W@Iowa State University@Argonne National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)@University of Chicago@Unknow@University of Chicago::Murphy, J@Iowa State University@Argonne National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)@University of Chicago@Unknow@University of Chicago::O'Muircheartaigh, C@Iowa State University@Argonne National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)@University of Chicago@Unknow@University of Chicago",not exist,"no title+BAILAR BA+EFFECTS CODERS+1972::no title+Bradburn, N.

Significantly insignificant F tests,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/0003130031108,FEB 2003,13,5,"P values near 1 are sometimes viewed as unimportant. In fact, P values near 1 should raise red flags cautioning data analysts that something may be wrong with their model. This article examines reasons why F statistics might get small in general linear models. One-way and two-way analysis of variance models are used to illustrate the general ideas. The article focuses on the intuitive motivation behind F tests based on second moment arguments. In particular, it argues that when the mean structure of the model being tested is correct, small F statistics can be caused by not accounting for negatively correlated data or heteroscedasticity; alternatively, they can be caused by an unsuspected lack of fit. It is also demonstrated that large F statistics can be generated by not accounting for positively correlated data or heteroscedasticity.","analysis of variance,correlation,heteroscedasticity,homoscedasticity,linear models,regression,robustness","OF-FIT TESTS,INDEPENDENCE","Christensen, R@Univ New Mexico, Dept Math & Stat, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA","Christensen, R@University of New Mexico",not exist,"EFFECT OF CORRELATIONS AND UNEQUAL VARIANCES IN TESTING FOR OUTLIERS IN LINEAR-REGRESSION+BAKSALARY, JK; NURHONEN, M; PUNTANEN, S+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+1992::IS THE T-TEST REALLY CONSERVATIVE WHEN THE PARENT DISTRIBUTION IS LONG-TAILED+BENJAMINI, Y+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1983::PEARSON,KARL AND FISHER,R.A.

College students' conceptions of probability,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/0003130031063,FEB 2003,14,10,"Students in an introductory statistics class were surveyed regarding their views about probability. The students were asked to assign some probabilities and give explanations for their assignments. Results from the surveys indicate that students were generally confused about the classical, frequency, and subjective notions of probabilities. Although the students were able to solve stylized classical probability problems, they were apt to assume that experimental outcomes were equally likely even when this assumption was inappropriate. In addition, the students were not comfortable specifying probabilities using the frequency and subjective views. This article discusses how this confusion about the interpretation of probability affects the teaching of an introductory statistics class and provides some activities helpful for teaching the various probability viewpoints.","Bayesian inference,classical, frequency, and subjective viewpoints",STATISTICS,"Albert, JH@Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA","Albert, JH@Bowling Green State University",not exist,"Teaching Bayes' rule: A data-oriented approach+Albert, J+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 1997::no title+Berry, D.A.+Statistics: A Bayesian Perspective+1996::Teaching elementary Bayesian statistics with real applications in science+Berry, DA+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 1997::no title+BLUMAN A+ELEMENTARY STAT+2001::no title+FALK R+STAT 21 CENTURY+1992::HOW STUDENTS LEARN STATISTICS+GARFIELD, J+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+APR 1995::no title+HAWKINS A+EDUC STUD MATH+1984::no title+no author+Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases+1982::INCONSISTENCIES IN STUDENTS REASONING ABOUT PROBABILITY+KONOLD, C; POLLATSEK, A; WELL, A; et al.+JOURNAL FOR RESEARCH IN MATHEMATICS EDUCATION+NOV 1993::no title+MOORE DS+BASIC PRACTICE STAT+2000::no title+MOORE DS+STAT 21 CENTURY+1992::Research in Probability and Statistics: Reflections and Directions+Shaughnessy, J.

Illustrating the Law of Large Numbers (and confidence intervals),AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/0003130031081,FEB 2003,0,2,"Instructors of introductory statistics classes tend to separate out abstract probability concepts because of the level of mathematics required to present them. The Law of Large Numbers, which explains why making repeated observations on a population is informative, seems. especially vulnerable to this tendency. This is unfortunate because the Law validates students' intuitive understanding about why statistics works and reinforces the notion that abstract probability concepts have important, real-life consequences. Instead of presenting the Law in a mathematical fashion, we propose a graphical presentation designed to communicate and emphasize the Law's importance. Specifically, we illustrate the effect that the Law of Large Numbers has on a sequence of sample means by plotting a randomly generated sequence of sample means versus their sample size. Students can then observe (1) how the sample mean approaches the population mean as the sample size grows large, (2) the variability associated with that process, and (3) the implied mathematical result. The corresponding sequence of probability intervals for the sample mean can then be superimposed on the plot to show how the sample mean's variability is reduced as the sample size grows. Furthermore the sequence of confidence intervals can also be superimposed on the plot to demonstrate that the concept of coverage probability applies only to the procedure for setting confidence intervals (which we refer to as a random probability interval) and not to the observed confidence interval itself.","central limit theorem,probability intervals,teaching",,"Blume, JD@Brown Univ, Ctr Stat Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA@Johns Hopkins Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA::Royall, RM@Brown Univ, Ctr Stat Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA@Johns Hopkins Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Blume, JD@Brown University@Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health@Johns Hopkins University::Royall, RM@Brown University@Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health@Johns Hopkins University",not exist,

A graphical method for assessing the fit of a logistic regression model,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313002560,NOV 2002,32,11,"Before a logistic regression model is used to describe the relationship between a binary response variable and predictors, the fit of the model should be assessed. The nature of any model deficiency may indicate that some aspect of the model should be reformulated or that poorly fitting observations need to be considered separately. We propose graphical methodology based on a Bayesian framework to address issues such as this. Publicly available software allows diagnostic plots to be constructed quickly and easily for any model of interest. These plots are more intuitive and meaningful than traditional graphical diagnostics such as residual plots.","Bayesian methodology,diagnostic plot,marginal model plot,model criticism,posterior predictive distribution","DIMENSION REDUCTION,PLOTS","Pardoe, I@Univ Oregon, Dept Decis Sci, Charles H Lundquist Coll Business, Eugene, OR 97403 USA@Univ Minnesota, Sch Stat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA::Cook, RD@Univ Oregon, Dept Decis Sci, Charles H Lundquist Coll Business, Eugene, OR 97403 USA@Univ Minnesota, Sch Stat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Pardoe, I@Oregon University System@University of Oregon@University of Minnesota Twin Cities@University of Minnesota System::Cook, RD@Oregon University System@University of Oregon@University of Minnesota Twin Cities@University of Minnesota System",not exist,"no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical Data Analysis+2002::no title+Becker, R.

Characterizing the diurnal rhythm of DHEA,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313002579,NOV 2002,20,4,"Recently, there has been a lot of effort in the scientific community to understand the role of the naturally occurring hormone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). In order to plan experiments optimally, it is critical first to characterize the diurnal rhythm in healthy individuals. We present an analysis of DHEA concentrations under the framework of linear mixed-effects model. The samples were collected over 23.5 hours on 49 healthy individuals (27 young: 15 men, 12 women; 22 elderly: 12 men, 10 women) under placebo and alprazolam (2 mg oral dose) treatments. The population profiles of diurnal variation of DHEA concentrations, specific to age, sex, and minority status, and the effect of alprazolam on DHEA concentrations are estimated.","alprazolam,hormone diurnal variation,intra-individual correlation,mixed-effects model,model selection,regression splines","DEHYDROEPIANDROSTERONE,SULFATE,SERUM,AGE,SEX","Erosheva, EA@Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Stat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA@Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA::Kroboth, PD@Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Stat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA@Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA::Greenhouse, JB@Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Stat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA@Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA","Erosheva, EA@Carnegie Mellon University@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@University of Pittsburgh::Kroboth, PD@Carnegie Mellon University@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@University of Pittsburgh::Greenhouse, JB@Carnegie Mellon University@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@University of Pittsburgh",not exist,"no title+AKAIKE H+2 INT S INF THEOR+1977::Dehydroepiandrosterone replacement in women with adrenal insufficiency+Arlt, W; Callies, F; van Vlijmen, JC; et al.+NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE+SEP 30 1999::DEHYDROEPIANDROSTERONE SULFATE AND DEHYDROEPIANDROSTERONE IN SERUM - DIFFERENCES RELATED TO AGE AND SEX+CARLSTROM, K; BRODY, S; LUNELL, NO; et al.+MATURITAS+DEC 1988::ROBUST LOCALLY WEIGHTED REGRESSION AND SMOOTHING SCATTERPLOTS+CLEVELAND, WS+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1979::no title+Davidian, M.; Giltinan, D.

Split-plot model with covariate: A cautionary tale,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313002597,NOV 2002,9,6,"Consider a split-plot model with one whole-plot factor, one subplot factor, and a covariate that does not depend on the subplot factor. We discuss the following three key areas where errors in the analysis of this simple model may occur: (1) correct specification of the model, (2) parameterization of variance components, and (3) the final analysis using PROC MIXED (SAS v 8.2). A further complication arises in cases where the within-whole-plot variability is larger than the between-whole-plot variability. We suggest two options, based on different assumptions, to accommodate cases like these, and the user is to decide which is most appropriate.","analysis of covariance,compound symmetry,PROC MIXED,repeated measures,variance components",,"Aldworth, J@IDEC Pharmaceut Corp, San Diego, CA 92121 USA@Eli Lilly & Co, Lilly Res Labs, Greenfield, IN 46140 USA::Hoffman, WP@IDEC Pharmaceut Corp, San Diego, CA 92121 USA@Eli Lilly & Co, Lilly Res Labs, Greenfield, IN 46140 USA","Aldworth, J@Biogen@Eli Lilly::Hoffman, WP@Biogen@Eli Lilly",not exist,"Statistical models for toxicity and safety pharmacology studies+Andersen, H; Spliid, H; Larsen, S+DRUG INFORMATION JOURNAL+APR-JUN 2000::AN APPROACH TO THE ANALYSIS OF REPEATED MEASUREMENTS+DIGGLE, PJ+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1988::COVARIANCE ANALYSIS FOR SPLIT-PLOT AND SPLIT-BLOCK DESIGNS+FEDERER, WT; MEREDITH, MP+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1992::Small sample inference for fixed effects from restricted maximum likelihood+Kenward, MG; Roger, JH+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1997::no title+Littell, R.C.; Milliken, G.A.; Stroup, W.W.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Wolfinger, R.D</span>.+SAS System for Mixed Models, SAS Institute+1996::no title+Milliken, G.

It discusses how the role of the statistician has evolved since Dr. Deming's death in 1993, and how his teachings have fared. It conjectures on what Deming would say about the current scene, and, especially, about the Six Sigma initiative. The proactive statistician is presented as a logical extension to today's environment of Deming's statistical leader. The contributions of the proactive statistician and specific opportunities are described. The role of academia is also discussed.","just-in-time maintenance,process improvement,quality,reliability,statistical leader,statistical thinking",IMPACT,"Hahn, GJ@Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Troy, NY 12181 USA","Hahn, GJ@Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute",not exist,"THE STATISTICIAN WHO CHANGED THE WORLD - DEMING,W.EDWARDS, 1900-1993+BOARDMAN, TJ+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 1994::no title+Box, G.

Seek whence: Answer sequences and their consequences in key-balanced multiple-choice tests,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313002623,NOV 2002,18,12,"The producers of the SAT balance answer keys rather than randomizing them. Whereas randomization yields keys that are balanced only on average, balancing assures this in every subtest. Balancing is a well-kept trade secret, and there is no evidence of awareness that it is exploitable. However, balancing leaves identifiable traces on answer keys. We present the evidence for key balancing, its signatures, and the ways in which testwise examinees can exploit it.

On khintchine's theorem and its place in random variate generation,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313002588,NOV 2002,19,4,"It is well known that if X and Y are uniformly distributed over the region between the horizontal axis and a density function f, then X is distributed according to density f. The algorithm ""generate Y from its marginal distribution, then X from its uniform conditional distribution given Y = y"" follows. The main point made in this article is that for monotone and unimodal distributions, this construction reduces to Khintchme's theorem, thereby yielding a simple explication thereof. This observation is followed up with further consideration of the general, nonummodal, case for both univariate and multivariate distributions, and parallels are drawn with an alternative random variate generation method called vertical density representation.","monotone density,uniform distribution,unimodal density,vertical density representation",DENSITY,"Jones, MC@Open Univ, Dept Stat, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England","Jones, MC@Open University - UK","Jones, Chris@A-3687-2009","SPATIAL STATISTICS AND BAYESIAN COMPUTATION+BESAG, J; GREEN, PJ+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1993::BAYES METHODS FOR A SYMMETRIC UNIMODAL DENSITY AND ITS MODE+BRUNNER, LJ; LO, AY+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1989::USING THE GIBBS SAMPLER TO SIMULATE FROM THE BAYES ESTIMATE OF A DECREASING DENSITY+BRUNNER, LJ+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1995::CONSTRUCTING AND SIMULATING MULTIVARIATE DISTRIBUTIONS USING KHINTCHINE THEOREM+BRYSON, MC; JOHNSON, ME+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+1982::Sampling truncated normal, beta, and gamma densities+Damien, P; Walker, SG+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+JUN 2001::Gibbs sampling for Bayesian non-conjugate and hierarchical models by using auxiliary variables+Damien, P; Wakefield, J; Walker, S+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1999::RANDOM VARIATE GENERATION FOR UNIMODAL AND MONOTONE DENSITIES+DEVROYE, L+COMPUTING+1984::no title+Devroye, L.+Non-uniform random variate generation+1986::no title+Dharmadhikari, SW; Joag-Dev, K.+Unimodality, convexity, and applications+1988::no title+Feller, W.+An introduction to probability theory and its applications+1971::Auxiliary variable methods for Markov chain Monte Carlo with applications+Higdon, DM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1998::Transformations and random variate generation generalised ratio-of-uniforms methods+Jones, MC; Lunn, AD+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+1996::On Unimodal Distributions+Khintchine, A.

Coin tosses can be biased only if the coin is allowed to bounce or be spun rather than simply flipped in the air.

We consider some of the properties of several iconic representations, in relation to the kind of task to be performed. (b) Reordering the variables in a correlation matrix so that ""similar"" variables are positioned adjacently, facilitating perception. In addition, the extension of this visualization to matrices for conditional independence and partial independence is described and illustrated, and we provide an easily used SAS implementation of these methods.","conditional independence,effect ordering,independence,partial correlation,SAS,value rendering,variable sorting,visual thinning,visualization",PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS,"Friendly, M@York Univ, Dept Psychol, N York, ON M3J 1P3, Canada","Friendly, M@York University - Canada",not exist,"THE GRAND TOUR - A TOOL FOR VIEWING MULTIDIMENSIONAL DATA+ASIMOV, D+SIAM JOURNAL ON SCIENTIFIC AND STATISTICAL COMPUTING+1985::ALGORITHM FOR CLUSTERING RELATIONAL DATA WITH APPLICATIONS TO SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND COMPARISON WITH MULTIDIMENSIONAL-SCALING+BREIGER, RL; BOORMAN, SA; ARABIE, P+JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1975::no title+Chambers, J.

A preliminary investigation of maximum likelihood logistic regression versus exact logistic regression,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/00031300283,AUG 2002,20,37,"Logistic regression is used by practitioners and researchers in many fields, but is undoubtedly used most frequently in medical and biostatistical applications. Maximum likelihood is generally the estimation method of choice, but we show that maximum likelihood can produce very poor results under certain conditions. Specifically, the poor performance of maximum likelihood in the case of rare events is known and we review research on this topic. We primarily examine the performance of maximum likelihood in the presence of near separation, which has apparently not been studied. Exact logistic regression is the logical alternative to maximum likelihood.

A note on the use of marginal likelihood and conditional likelihood in analyzing clustered data,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/00031300292,AUG 2002,8,7,"In the analysis of clustered data, when a generalized linear model with a random intercept term is fitted using maximum marginal likelihood and maximum conditional likelihood, respectively, a discrepancy between estimated regression coefficients from the two methods has been observed. This discrepancy happens when some cluster-level confounders are omitted from the model. Here we offer a straightforward explanation for the discrepancy in terms of different modeling assumptions underlying the use of the two likelihood functions. Specifically, the marginal likelihood approach requires a full distributional assumption on random effects, and this assumption is violated when some cluster-level confounders are omitted from the model. We also propose to use residual plots to uncover the problem.","confounding,generalized linear models,modeling assumptions,residual plots","PERIODONTAL-DISEASE PROGRESSION,BINARY DATA,ASSOCIATION MODELS","Pan, W@Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Biostat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Pan, W@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities",not exist,"An empirical comparison of several clustered data approaches under confounding due to cluster effects in the analysis of complications of coronary angioplasty+Berlin, JA; Kimmel, SE; Ten Have, TR; et al.+BIOMETRICS+JUN 1999::no title+Cameron, A.

Quantitative analysis of literary styles,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313002100,AUG 2002,18,29,"Writers are often viewed as having an inherent style that can serve as a literary fingerprint. By quantifying relevant features related to literary style, one may hope to classify written works and even attribute authorship to newly discovered texts. Beyond its intrinsic interest, the study of literary styles presents the opportunity to introduce and motivate many standard multivariate statistical techniques. Today the statistical analysis of literary styles is made much simpler by the wealth of real data readily available from the Internet. This article presents an overview and brief history of the analysis of literary styles.

Median of the p value under the alternative hypothesis,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313002146,AUG 2002,10,11,"Due to absence of an universally acceptable magnitude of the Type I error in various fields, p values are used as a well-recognized tool in decision making in all areas of statistical practice. The distribution of p values under the null hypothesis is uniform. However, under the alternative hypothesis the distribution of the p values is skewed. The expected p value (EPV) has been proposed by authors to be used as a measure of the performance of the test. This article proposes the median of the P values (MPV) which is more appropriate for this purpose. We work out many examples to calculate the MPV's directly and also compare the MPV with the EPV. We consider testing equality of distributions against stochastic ordering in the multinomial case and compare the EPV's and MPV's by simulation. A second simulation study for general continuous data is also considered for two samples with different test statistics for the same hypotheses. In both cases MPV performs better than EPV.","comparing test statistics,expected p value,median p value,power,stochastic order",,"Bhattacharya, B@So Illinois Univ, Dept Math, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA@Univ Georgia, Dept Stat, Athens, GA 30602 USA::Habtzghi, D@So Illinois Univ, Dept Math, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA@Univ Georgia, Dept Stat, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Bhattacharya, B@Southern Illinois University System@Southern Illinois University@University System of Georgia@University of Georgia::Habtzghi, D@Southern Illinois University System@Southern Illinois University@University System of Georgia@University of Georgia",not exist,"Hypothesis estimates and acceptability profiles for 2 x 2 contingency tables+Blyth, CR; Staudte, RG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1997::EXPECTED SIGNIFICANCE LEVEL AS A SENSITIVITY INDEX FOR TEST STATISTICS+DEMPSTER, AP; SCHATZOFF, M+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1965::no title+DOLLINGER MB+ROBUST STAT DATA ANA+1996::no title+Dykstra, R.

"Bayesian design of ""successful"" replications",AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313002155,AUG 2002,15,11,"Replication of experiments is common in applied research. However, systematic studies of the goals and motivations of a ""replication"" are rare. As a consequence, there does not seem to be a precise notion of what a ""success"" when replicating means. This article discusses some of the possible goals for replication; this leads to different (but precise) notions of ""success"" when replicating. Bayesian hierarchical models allow for a flexible and explicit incorporation of the assumed relationship among the experiments. Bayesian predictive distributions are a natural tool to compute the probability of the replication being successful, and hence to design the replication so that the probability of success is high enough.

Hypothesis testing about proportions in two finite populations,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313002164,AUG 2002,15,4,The problem of hypothesis testing about proportions in two finite populations is addressed. The usual test based on the normal approximation (Z test) and a test based on estimated p values (E test) are considered. The exact properties of the tests are evaluated numerically. Numerical studies indicate that the E test is very satisfactory even for small samples and can be recommended for practical use. Power computation for a given level and sample size is also outlined for both tests. The testing methods are illustrated using an example.,"binomial distribution,exact power,exact size,hypergeometric distribution,sample size calculation,standardized difference","2 BINOMIAL PROPORTIONS,CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS,SAMPLE SIZES","Krishnamoorthy, K@Univ Louisiana Lafayette, Dept Math, Lafayette, LA 70504 USA::Thomson, J@Univ Louisiana Lafayette, Dept Math, Lafayette, LA 70504 USA","Krishnamoorthy, K@University of Louisiana Lafayette::Thomson, J@University of Louisiana Lafayette",not exist,"BOOTSTRAP ONE-SIDED CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS FOR THE LOG-NORMAL MEAN+ANGUS, JE+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES D-THE STATISTICIAN+1994::More powerful tests from confidence interval p values+Berger, RL+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+NOV 1996::A NOTE ON CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS FOR PROPORTIONS IN FINITE POPULATIONS+BUONACCORSI, JP+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 1987::FINITE POPULATION CORRECTION FOR BINOMIAL CONFIDENCE LIMITS+BURSTEIN, H+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1975::no title+Casella, G.; Berger, R.+Statistical Inference+2002::Test-based exact confidence intervals for the difference of two binomial proportions+Chan, ISF; Zhang, ZX+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1999::no title+Efron, B.+The jackknife, the bootstrap and other resampling plans+1982::no title+Hall, P.+The bootstrap and Edgeworth expansion+1992::CONFIDENCE INTERVALS FOR THE NUMBER SHOWING A CERTAIN CHARACTERISTIC IN A POPULATION WHEN SAMPLING IS WITHOUT REPLACEMENT+KATZ, L+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1953::A note on the determination of sample sizes for hypergeometric distributions+Li, SY; Chen, HJ+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1999::PRACTICAL TESTS OF 2BY2 CONTINGENCY-TABLES+LIDDELL, D+STATISTICIAN+1976::EXACT PROPERTIES OF SOME EXACT TEST STATISTICS FOR COMPARING 2 BINOMIAL PROPORTIONS+STORER, BE; KIM, C+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1990::EXACT UNCONDITIONAL SAMPLE SIZES FOR THE 2X2 BINOMIAL TRIAL+SUISSA, S; SHUSTER, JJ+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1985::no title+THOMSON JL+THESIS U LOUISIANA L+2002::Likelihood confidence intervals for proportions in finite populations+Wendell, JP; Schmee, J+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+FEB 2001"
Is human height bimodal?,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/0031300265,AUG 2002,23,54,"The combined distribution of heights of men and women has become the canonical illustration of bimodality when teaching introductory statistics. But is this example appropriate? This article investigates the conditions under which a mixture of two normal distributions is bimodal. A simple justification is presented that a mixture of equally weighted normal distributions with common standard deviation sigma is bimodal if and only if the difference between the means of the distributions is greater than 2sigma. More generally, a mixture of two normal distributions with similar variability cannot be bimodal unless their means differ by more than approximately the sum of their standard deviations. Examination of national survey data on young adults shows that the separation between the distributions of men's and women's heights is not wide enough to produce bimodality. We suggest reasons why histograms of height nevertheless often appear bimodal.","bimodal distribution,living histogram,normal distribution",,"Schilling, MF@Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Math, Northridge, CA 91330 USA::Watkins, AE@Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Math, Northridge, CA 91330 USA::Watkins, W@Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Math, Northridge, CA 91330 USA","Schilling, MF@California State University System@California State University Northridge::Watkins, AE@California State University System@California State University Northridge::Watkins, W@California State University System@California State University Northridge",not exist,"ON MODES OF A MIXTURE OF 2 NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS+BEHBOODIAN, J+TECHNOMETRICS+1970::no title+BLAKESLEE AF+J HERED+1914::Compound normal distribution (advanced problems and solutions)+Cohen, AC; Burke, PJ.+Am Math Mon+1956::Birth defects, Jimson weeds and Bell curves+Crow, JF+GENETICS+SEP 1997::no title+Devore, J.; Peck, R.+Statistics the exploration and analysis of data+1997::GENESIS OF BIMODAL DISTRIBUTIONS+EISENBERGER, I+TECHNOMETRICS+1964::no title+Everitt, B.S; Hand, D.J.+Finite Mixture Distributions+1981::Sui massimi delle curve dimorfiche+Helguero, F.d.+Biometrika+1904::no title+HODGES JL+STATLAB EMPIRICAL IN+1975::DECOMPOSITION OF A MIXTURE INTO NORMAL COMPONENTS - REVIEW+HOLGERSSON, M; JORNER, U+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIO-MEDICAL COMPUTING+1978::no title+Iversen, GR.+Statistics: The Conceptual Approach+1997::no title+JOINER BL+INT STAT REV+1975::Unimodality conditions of the distribution of a mixture of two distributions+Kakiuchi, I.+Kobe Univ.

Beyond traditional statistical methods,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313002173,AUG 2002,4,7,"Today's courses in statistical methods, for the most part, focus on the same methods that were taught 30 years ago. The actual practice of statistics has moved beyond these traditional statistical methods. Modern methods-including dynamic graphics, nonlinear estimation, resampling, and other simulation-based inference methods-are being used by many scientists and engineers. However, these methods generally are not included in courses in statistical methods, especially at the undergraduate level. This article discusses the development of a collection of instructional modules, built around actual applications from science and engineering. Each module is self-contained and includes instructional materials such as: objectives, examples, lecture materials, computer implementation of the methodology, homework, class/discussion exercises, and assignments. The modules are intended as a resource for instructors to experiment with and explore the use of modern statistical methodology in undergraduate statistics methods courses. Two of the modules will be presented in some detail. We also discuss the use of the modules in a new course that goes beyond our traditional methods courses.","computer intensive,instructional modules,undergraduate statistics education",,"Duckworth, WA@Iowa State Univ, Dept Stat, Ames, IA 50011 USA::Stephenson, WR@Iowa State Univ, Dept Stat, Ames, IA 50011 USA","Duckworth, WA@Iowa State University::Stephenson, WR@Iowa State University",not exist,"A COMPARISON OF GREEN-BACKED HERON NESTING IN TWO FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS+KAISER M S; REID F A+Colonial Waterbirds+1987::no title+KETTENRING J+AMSTAT NEWS      MAY+1996::Accelerated degradation tests: Modeling and analysis+Meeker, WQ; Escobar, LA; Lu, JC+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 1998::no title+Pinheiro, JC; Bates, DM.+Mixed Effects Models, Methods, and Classes for S and Splus+1995"

Confidence intervals for theta can be constructed by the Wald method, by exact inference, from a variance stabilizing transformation, or by many other techniques. When ntheta is small, actual and nominal coverage can differ substantially. We compare nine confidence intervals for a Poisson mean with respect to coverage and expected width of confidence limits. We show that, for small ntheta: of the confidence intervals considered, only the exact interval maintains coverage probabilities; while the scores interval approximately maintains coverage probability, its expected width exceeds the exact interval's; and a modified version of the confidence interval based on the variance stabilized confidence interval has coverage properties near the nominal and an expected width that is not particularly large. Thus, we recommend that investigators desiring true cover not less than nominal use the exact interval and those willing to accept approximate coverage use a modified form of the variance stabilized interval.","confidence interval,exact inference,Poisson distribution,small sample,scores interval",,"Barker, L@Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Atlanta, GA 30333 USA","Barker, L@Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA",not exist,"THE TRANSFORMATION OF POISSON, BINOMIAL AND NEGATIVE-BINOMIAL DATA+ANSCOMBE, FJ+BIOMETRIKA+1948::TRANSFORMATIONS RELATED TO THE ANGULAR AND THE SQUARE ROOT+FREEMAN, MF; TUKEY, JW+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1950::Two-sided confidence intervals for the single proportion: Comparison of seven methods+Newcombe, RG+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+APR 30 1998::Interval estimation for the difference between independent proportions: Comparison of eleven methods+Newcombe, RG+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+APR 30 1998"

Consider generalized inverse binomial sampling where each independent string of iid Bernoulli trials is constructed by sampling until k, k greater than or equal to 2, successes in a row are observed. Path counts to the points in the sampling plan form Pascal triangles of order (k, 8). The N-P MP test is constructed from the two-dimensional statistic which is minimally sufficient for the one-dimensional parameter space, and it partitions a two-dimensional sample space. Power curve comparisons with two competing tests clearly show that the N-P test is MP but not UMP.

Each diagnostic display consists of a matrix of plots for a series of ARIMA(p, d, q) models (with p = 1:p(max), q =1:q(max) and d constant). In this way the identification phase of the analysis is eased because the analyst can directly see the incremental effect of each proposed term. The direct visual comparison of the models is helpful to the experienced analyst because it makes immediate the difference in the explanatory capabilities of the various models. The series of plots is very helpful in presenting time series concepts, particularly the identification phase, to introductory classes.

Representing trees using Microsoft doughnut charts,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313002317572817,MAY 2002,23,0,"Trees are widely used to represent and solve problems in Bayesian statistics, risk analysis, marketing statistics, reliability theory, and Markov chains. But they have three limitations: (1) for moderately sized problems, the tree becomes unwieldy; (2) while the tree is very good at visually representing qualitative relationships, it does not allow visual representation of quantitative information; and (3) the tree is not easily represented on a PC without special software. In the spirit of Tufte, this article presents an alternative, the circular decision tree, which visually represents all the information-problem structure, strengths of relationship, and values of nodes-using colors and are lengths. Mathematical computations in the tree are accomplished by ""mixing colors"" from adjacent segments. Furthermore, it is easily programmable in Excel.

The saw-toothed behavior of power versus sample size and software solutions: Single binomial proportion using exact methods,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313002317572835,MAY 2002,9,27,"With the speed of modem computers it is now feasible to replace normal approximations with exact methods. For continuous random variables it is intuitively clear that for a given significance level and alternative hypothesis the power function increases monotonically as the sample size increases. One would expect the same to be true for discrete random variables, but such is not the case. This article demonstrates in the simple case of a test of a single binomial proportion compared to a hypothesized standard that the power function has a saw-toothed shape and hence is not monotonically increasing. We demonstrate this using the software package nQuery Advisor 4.0, the version that has the capability of doing power calculations using exact binomial methods. We compare that software with competitors that also do exact binomial calculations. The reason for this counter-intuitive result is that a significance level of 0.05, for example, cannot be obtained exactly for most sample sizes. So by a 0.05 significance level for a given sample size n we mean the largest level below 0.05. That level determines the critical value for the test statistic and the critical value determines the power at any given alternative. If n is such that the exact significance level is appreciably lower than 0.05 (say 0.01) and the power is 80% at a particular alternative, the power could easily drop below 80% for n + 1 and the same alternative hypothesis, since the exact significance level does not remain at 0.01 but may stay below but get closer to 0.05. This is particularly the case for small n. We find this result to be important in determining sample size for our clinical trials. We often have endpoints that are proportions and we use fixed sample size trials to compare our device's performance to a control or an objective performance criterion. We illustrate this result in the case of a single binomial proportion, but this property really depends only on the discrete nature of the sampling distribution for the test statistic. Hence it also occurs for permutation tests and in the comparison of the difference or ratio of two binomials.","binomial distribution,exact methods,hypothesis testing,permutation tests,power function",,"Chernick, MR@Novo Nordisk Pharmaceut Inc, Biostat, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA@Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, CA 91765 USA::Liu, CY@Novo Nordisk Pharmaceut Inc, Biostat, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA@Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, CA 91765 USA","Chernick, MR@Novo Nordisk@Unknow::Liu, CY@Novo Nordisk@Unknow",not exist,"no title+Borenstein, M; Rothstein, H; Cohen, J.+Power and precision TM+2001::Interval estimation for a binomial proportion - Comment - Rejoinder+Brown, LD; Cai, TT; DasGupta, A; et al.+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 2001::The use of confidence or fiducial limits illustrated in the case of the binomial.+Clopper, CJ; Pearson, ES+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1934::no title+*CYTEL SOFTW CORP+STATX 4 WIND STAT SO+1998::no title+ELASHOFF JD+NQUERY ADVISOR RELEA+2000::no title+Hahn, G.

The role of informative priors in zero-numerator problems: Being conservative versus being candid,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313002753631295,FEB 2002,10,25,"The ""Rule of Three"" gives an approximation for an upper 95% confidence bound for a proportion in a zero-numerator problem, which occurs when the observed relative frequency is zero. We compare the results from the Rule of Three with those from a Bayesian approach with noninformative and informative priors. Informative priors are especially valuable in zero-numerator problems because they can represent the available information and because different noninformative priors can give conflicting advice. Moreover, the use of upper 95% bounds and noninformative priors in an effort to be conservative may backfire when the values are used in further predictive or decision-theoretic calculations. It is better to be candid than conservative, using all of the information available in forming the prior and considering the uncertainty represented by the full posterior distribution.","Bayesian inference,noninformative priors,rare events,Rule of Three",,"Winkler, RL@Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27708 USA@Duke Univ, Inst Stat & Decis Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA@Univ Wisconsin, Dept Populat Hlth Sci, Madison, WI 53705 USA::Smith, JE@Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27708 USA@Duke Univ, Inst Stat & Decis Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA@Univ Wisconsin, Dept Populat Hlth Sci, Madison, WI 53705 USA::Fryback, DG@Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27708 USA@Duke Univ, Inst Stat & Decis Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA@Univ Wisconsin, Dept Populat Hlth Sci, Madison, WI 53705 USA","Winkler, RL@Duke University@Duke University@University of Wisconsin System@University of Wisconsin Madison::Smith, JE@Duke University@Duke University@University of Wisconsin System@University of Wisconsin Madison::Fryback, DG@Duke University@Duke University@University of Wisconsin System@University of Wisconsin Madison",not exist,"no title+Chen, M.-H.; Shao, Q.

Measuring a binary response's range of influence in logistic regression,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313002753631303,FEB 2002,15,4,This article proposes a conceptually simple class of diagnostics to determine the potential of a single binary response to affect the outcome of a logistic regression. We simply rerun the regression once for each observation after changing the response and calculate how much the statistics of interest have changed. We show how statistics of this type may be helpful in checking the robustness of a logistic regression and study their relationship to earlier proposed diagnostics.,"diagnostic,generalized linear model,leverage","DIAGNOSTICS,MODELS","Fay, MP@NCI, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Fay, MP@National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA@NIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)","Fay, Michael@A-2974-2008::Fay, Michael P.@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8643-9625","no title+Belsley, DA; Kuh, E; Welsch, RE.+Regression Diagnostics: Identifying Influential Data and Sources of Collinearity+1980::no title+Chambers, J.

"Thoughts on the origins, concepts, and pedagogy of statistics as a ""separate discipline""",AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313002753631321,FEB 2002,48,4,"Statistics arose in part out of the interplay between mathematics and the data-analytic needs of various applied sciences (Stigler 1999). Close linkages to mathematics and to research-oriented fields have prompted debate over the emergence of statistics as a distinct field of study. Efforts to differentiate statistics from mathematics have drawn attention to its unique history, questions. and content. Insofar as statistics is an evolving subject area, with academic and practical ties to a number of disciplines and professions, it continues to benefit from the examination of its origins, nature, and unfolding. This article contributes to this general goal through a review of (a) early definitions of statistics, (b) recent discussions of disciplinary boundaries, (c) twentieth-century reform views on including statistics topics in school mathematics, and (d) the impact of curricular and pedagogic factors on the uniformity of the discipline.","disciplinary boundaries,history,school mathematics,statistics education","EDUCATION,MATHEMATICS","Bessant, KC@Brandon Univ, Brandon, MB R7A 6A9, Canada@Univ Manitoba, Fac Educ, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada::MacPherson, ED@Brandon Univ, Brandon, MB R7A 6A9, Canada@Univ Manitoba, Fac Educ, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada","Bessant, KC@Brandon University@University of Manitoba::MacPherson, ED@Brandon University@University of Manitoba",not exist,"no title+ADAMS WJ+LIFE TIMES CENTRAL L+1974::no title+*AM STAT ASS+CURR GUID UND PROGR+2001::no title+BIDWELL JK+READINGS HIST MATH E+1970::Teaching introductory statistics courses so that nonstatisticians experience statistical reasoning+Bradstreet, TE+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+FEB 1996::no title+BRYCE GR+CURRICULUM GUIDELINE+2001::Reconsidering Statistics Education: A National Science Foundation Conference+Cobb, G.

First, we bound the size of the test at the nominal level. Second, we bound the resampling risk, which we define as the expected value of the probability of reaching an accept/reject decision different from complete enumeration. This second bound holds over a postulated set of distributions for the p value, where each distribution is associated with a probability model of the data.

We consider eight tests of the null hypothesis that the absolute difference of two binomial random variables' success probabilities is at least a prespecified Delta > 0 versus the alternative that the difference is less than Delta. The tests considered are: six forms of the two one-sided test, a modified form of the Patel-Gupta test, and the likelihood ratio rest. The applicability of each test in a given setting depends on how well the test maintains its nominal size, the power of the test, and the ease with which it is implemented.

Randomization inference and bias of standard errors,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313001753272268,NOV 2001,15,15,"A nonparametric statistics course typically includes material regarding ""distribution free"" randomization based inference. However, the accuracy of reported p values and confidence intervals often relies on an unverifiable assumption of unit(subject)treatment additivity. This assumption is not always explicitly stated in texts and, when the assumption does not hold, the implications on inference are seldom discussed. The focus of this article is the bias of standard errors of estimated mean treatment effects in the presence of nonadditivity. This bias is characterized and interpreted for a usual estimator of standard, error in three common experimental designs: a two-sample completely randomized design, a matched-pairs design, and a balanced, two-period cross-over design. Even in the presence of nonadditivity, useful conservative estimates of a mean treatment effect can be obtained.

Efficiency study of estimators for a treatment effect in a pretest-posttest trial,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313001753272466,NOV 2001,10,46,"Several possible methods, used to evaluate treatment effects in a randomized pretest-posttest trial with two treatment groups are the two-sample t test, the paired t test, analysis of covariance I (ANCOVA I), the analysis of covariance II (ANCOVA W), and generalized estimating equations (GEE). The ANCOVA I includes treatment and baseline response as covariates in a linear model and ANCOVA H additionally includes an interaction term between the baseline response and treatment indicator as a covariate. The parameters in the ANCOVA I and ANCOVA H models are generally estimated using ordinary least squares. In this article, a semiparametric model, which makes no assumptions about the response distributions, is used. The asymptotic properties of the estimators derived from these five methods and their relative efficiencies are discussed under this semiparametric model. We show that all these methods yield consistent estimators for the treatment effect which have asymptotically normal distributions under the semiparametric model. The GEE and the ANCOVA H estimators are asymptotically equivalent and the most efficient. The estimators from other three methods are less efficient except under some special conditions which are outlined in the article.","analysis of covariance,GEE model,paired t test,semiparametric model,two-sample t test",,"Yang, L@SAS Inst Inc, Cary, NC 27513 USA@N Carolina State Univ, Dept Stat, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA::Tsiatis, AA@SAS Inst Inc, Cary, NC 27513 USA@N Carolina State Univ, Dept Stat, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Yang, L@Unknow@University of North Carolina@North Carolina State University::Tsiatis, AA@Unknow@University of North Carolina@North Carolina State University",not exist,"ASYMPTOTIC EFFICIENCY IN ESTIMATION WITH CONDITIONAL MOMENT RESTRICTIONS+CHAMBERLAIN, G+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+MAR 1987::ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE IN PARALLEL-GROUP CLINICAL-TRIALS WITH PRETREATMENT BASELINES+CRAGER, MR+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1987::A COMPARISON OF THE PRECISION OF 3 EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGNS EMPLOYING A CONCOMITANT VARIABLE+FELDT, LS+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1958::THE EFFECT OF SCREENING ON SOME PRETEST POSTTEST TEST VARIANCES+FOLLMANN, DA+BIOMETRICS+JUN 1991::FURTHER COMPARATIVE ANALYSES OF PRETEST-POSTTEST RESEARCH DESIGNS+LAIRD, N+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+1983::SEMIPARAMETRIC EFFICIENCY BOUNDS+NEWEY, WK+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+APR-JUN 1990::no title+PIGRACHE RM+BIOL PSYCHOL+1976::Regression models for the analysis of pretest/posttest data+Singer, JM; Andrade, DF+BIOMETRICS+JUN 1997::no title+STEIN RA+ASA BIOPARMACEUTICAL+1989::LONGITUDINAL DATA-ANALYSIS FOR DISCRETE AND CONTINUOUS OUTCOMES+ZEGER, SL; LIANG, KY+BIOMETRICS+MAR 1986"

BYU teachers also use statistical projects to teach many other important preschool skills.","early childhood development,experiments,quantitative literacy,surveys",,"Hilton, SC@Brigham Young Univ, Dept Stat, Provo, UT 84602 USA@Utah Valley State Coll, Educ Child & Family Studies Dept, Orem, UT 84058 USA::Grimshaw, SD@Brigham Young Univ, Dept Stat, Provo, UT 84602 USA@Utah Valley State Coll, Educ Child & Family Studies Dept, Orem, UT 84058 USA::Anderson, GT@Brigham Young Univ, Dept Stat, Provo, UT 84602 USA@Utah Valley State Coll, Educ Child & Family Studies Dept, Orem, UT 84058 USA","Hilton, SC@Brigham Young University@Utah System of Higher Education@Utah Valley University::Grimshaw, SD@Brigham Young University@Utah System of Higher Education@Utah Valley University::Anderson, GT@Brigham Young University@Utah System of Higher Education@Utah Valley University",not exist,"no title+no author+Developmentally appropriate practice in early childhood programs+1997::no title+no author+Principles and standards for school mathematics+2000::no title+Piaget, J.+Play, dreams, and imitation in childhood+1962::no title+Vygotsky, L.

Exploring the confidence interval for a binomial parameter in a first course in statistical computing,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313001753272501,NOV 2001,5,12,"The simple problem of providing a confidence interval for the estimate of a binomial parameter can prove to be quite interesting. There are a suprising variety of competing intervals to choose from, using both frequentist and Bayes methods. A reasonable criterion for comparing these confidence intervals is: How close does the actual coverage probability come to the target coverage probability, over a range of sample sizes and true population proportions? This material lends itself nicely to a first class in statistical computing. The computation of actual coverage probabilities for the standard approximate confidence interval is a good first simulations assignment involving a random number generator and calculations within a loop, and the variety of competing intervals covers a broad spectrum of computational difficulty. The standard approximate confidence interval that is most often found in introductory textbooks has rather poor performance compared to the alternatives. These comparisons give students an opportunity to write a ""paper,"" with tables of simulations results, figures, and the practice of writing introduction, methods, results, and conclusions. This article presents an overview of confidence interval methods, including some simple ""fixes"" to the standard interval, the Wilson or ""score"" interval, the ""exact"" interval, and the Bayes credible intervals. After discussion of each interval, there are suggestions for computing assignments. Our experience shows that these statistical computing assignments, based on a simple and familiar problem, are empowering to the students, especially when they conclude that many textbooks are ""wrong"" in their recommendations! They go on to tackle more complicated simulations problems, in other classes and in their own research, with more confidence.","Bayes credible interval,exact confidence interval,population proportion,prior distribution,score interval,statistical simulations,Wilson confidence interval",,"Henderson, M@Univ Georgia, Dept Stat, Athens, GA 30602 USA::Meyer, MC@Univ Georgia, Dept Stat, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Henderson, M@University of Georgia@University System of Georgia::Meyer, MC@University of Georgia@University System of Georgia",not exist,"Approximate is better than ""exact"" for interval estimation of binomial proportions+Agresti, A; Coull, BA+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1998::no title+BROWN LD+IN PRESS ANN STAT+1999::The use of confidence or fiducial limits illustrated in the case of the binomial.+Clopper, CJ; Pearson, ES+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1934::no title+Press, W.H.; Teukolsky, S.A.; Vetterling, W.T.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Flannery, B.P</span>.+Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing+1999::Probable inference, the law of succession, and statistical inference+Wilson, EB+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1927"

The central limit theorem under simple random sampling,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313001753272330,NOV 2001,14,3,"Proof of the central limit theorem for the sample mean can be obtained in the case of independent and identically distributed random variables through the moment generating function under some simplifying assumptions. The case for the central limit theorem for the sample mean from finite populations under simple random sample without replacement, the parallel to the simplest case in the standard framework, is not as simple. Most sampling a textbooks avoid any technical discussion of the finite population central limit theorem so that there is little appreciation for the conditions that underlay the theorem. Most often the theorem is illustrated with a simulation study; but this can only hint at the technicalities of the theorem. Now, new software has been developed that allows for automatic calculation of moments and cumulants of estimators used in survey sampling, as well as automatic derivation of unbiased or consistent estimators. This software is used to examine the assumptions behind the applications of central limit theorem under simple random sampling without replacement. Moreover, the demonstration of the theorem through this software relies on the cumulant generating function thus providing a parallel to the demonstration of the theorem in the standard case.","asymptotic distributions,computer algebra,cumulants",,"Bellhouse, DR@Univ Western Ontario, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada","Bellhouse, DR@Western University (University of Western Ontario)",not exist,"Symbolic operators for multiple sums+Bellhouse, DR; Philips, R; Stafford, JE+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JUN 5 1997::no title+Cochran, W.

On judging the significance of differences by examining the overlap between confidence intervals,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313001317097960,AUG 2001,31,428,"To judge whether the difference between two point estimates is statistically significant, data analysts often examine the overlap between the two associated confidence intervals. We compare this technique to the standard method of testing significance under the common assumptions of consistency, asymptotic normality, and asymptotic independence of the estimates. Rejection of the null hypothesis by the method of examining overlap implies rejection by the standard method, whereas failure to reject by the method of examining overlap does not imply failure to reject by the standard method. As a consequence, the method of examining overlap is more conservative (i.e., rejects the null hypothesis less often) than the standard method when the null hypothesis is true, and it mistakenly fails to reject the null hypothesis more frequently than does the standard method when the null hypothesis is false. Although the method of examining overlap is simple and especially convenient when lists or graphs of confidence intervals have been presented, we conclude that it should not be used for formal significance testing unless the data analyst is aware of its deficiencies and unless the information needed to carry out a more appropriate procedure is unavailable.","efficiency,inference,power,test of significance,two-sample problem,type I error","EVALUATING CLINICAL-TRIALS,HEALTH","Schenker, N@Natl Ctr Hlth Stat, Div Hlth Interview Stat, Hyattsville, MD 20782 USA::Gentleman, JF@Natl Ctr Hlth Stat, Div Hlth Interview Stat, Hyattsville, MD 20782 USA","Schenker, N@CDC National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)@Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA::Gentleman, JF@CDC National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)@Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA",not exist,"Vascular and cardiac remodeling in world class professional cyclists+Abergel, E; Linhart, A; Chatellier, G; et al.+AMERICAN HEART JOURNAL+NOV 1998::Reporting NHS performance: how did the media perform?+Appleby, J; Bell, A.+BMJ+2000::no title+Bickel, PJ; Doksum, KA.+Mathematical Statistics: Basic Ideas and Selected Topics+1977::Understanding and evaluating clinical trials - Reply+Bigby, M+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY+NOV 1997::Understanding and evaluating clinical trials+Bigby, M; Gadenne, AS+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY+APR 1996::no title+Brownlee, K.

Some practical guidelines for effective sample size determination,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313001317098149,AUG 2001,23,362,"Sample size determination is often an important step in planning a statistical study-and it is usually a difficult one. Among the important hurdles to be surpassed, one must obtain an estimate of one or more error variances and specify an effect size of importance. There is the temptation to take some shortcuts. This article offers some suggestions for successful and meaningful sample size determination. Also discussed is the possibility that sample size may not be the main issue, that the real goal is to design a high-quality study. Finally, criticism is made of some ill-advised shortcuts relating to power and sample size.","Cohen's effect measures,equivalence testing,observed power,power,retrospective power,study design","CONFIDENCE-BOUNDS,POWER","Lenth, RV@Univ Iowa, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA","Lenth, RV@University of Iowa","Rohlf, F@A-8710-2008","no title+Boen, J.

The results are used to examine the value of having the ith versus the jth overall pick, to rank the drafting success of franchises, and to evaluate the performance of European players.

They are closely related: the widths of the two intervals on the logit scale are shown to be related by a simple sinh function. Similarly, the Woolf logit Wald interval for the odds ratio and the analogous interval for the relative risk may be shortened by inverse sinh transformation. This modified interval can be calculated even when one of the cells contains a zero. It then takes a very simple form in which the appropriate centile of the chi-square distribution on one degree of freedom is substituted for the zero.

It is usually introduced as a nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator, or else as the output of an imputation scheme for censored observations such as redistribute-to-the-right or self-consistency. Following recent work by Robins and Rotnitzky, we show that the Kaplan-Meier estimator can also be represented as a weighted average of identically distributed terms, where the weights are related to the survival function of censoring times. We give two demonstrations of this representation; the first assumes a Kaplan-Meier form for the censoring time survival function, the second estimates the survival functions of failure and censoring times simultaneously and can be developed without prior introduction to the Kaplan-Meier estimator.","Horvitz-Thompson estimator,product-limit estimator,survival analysis",TRUNCATED DATA,"Satten, GA@CDCP, Div HIV AIDS Prevent Surveillance & Epidemiol, Natl Ctr HIV STD & TB Prevent, Atlanta, GA 30333 USA@Univ Georgia, Dept Stat, Athens, GA 30602 USA::Datta, S@CDCP, Div HIV AIDS Prevent Surveillance & Epidemiol, Natl Ctr HIV STD & TB Prevent, Atlanta, GA 30333 USA@Univ Georgia, Dept Stat, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Satten, GA@Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA@University System of Georgia@University of Georgia::Datta, S@Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA@University System of Georgia@University of Georgia",not exist,"The two sample problem with censored data+Efron, B.+Fifth Berkeley Symposium on Mathematical Statistics and Probability+1967::A NOTE ON NONPARAMETRIC-ESTIMATION OF THE DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION FROM INTERVAL-CENSORED AND TRUNCATED OBSERVATIONS+FRYDMAN, H+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1994::no title+Kalbfleisch, J.

The purpose of this article is to draw attention to the fact that when assessing the reliability of a network there are circumstances under which the paradox comes into play, and to show the consequences of the paradox on the calculated reliability. In particular, we are able to establish the counter-intuitive result that the reliability of a series system of n components, whose life-lengths are independent, converges to a half (and not to zero), as n increases.","expert testimonies,identical components,probability protocols,retrospective conditioning,unanticipated knowledge",PROBABILITY,"Singpurwalla, ND@George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA::Swift, A@George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA","Singpurwalla, ND@George Washington University::Swift, A@George Washington University","SINGPURWALLA, Nozer Darabsha@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3578-2308","no title+Barlow, R.

Properties of the ML estimators as the observation period gets long are particularly important when the observation period corresponds to the test interval, since extending the test interval is the most natural way to improve the reliability of the software prior to its release. In addition to providing insight on how to interpret the ML estimators in actual applications, our result also has pedagogical value as an illustration that asymptotic properties of ML estimators cannot be taken for granted.","consistency of MLEs,NHPP models,software failure rate",ERROR-DETECTION,"Jeske, DR@Bell Labs, Lucent Technol, Performance Anal Dept, Holmdel, NJ 07733 USA@Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Piscataway, NJ USA::Pham, H@Bell Labs, Lucent Technol, Performance Anal Dept, Holmdel, NJ 07733 USA@Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Piscataway, NJ USA","Jeske, DR@Alcatel-Lucent@AT&T@Lucent Technologies@Rutgers State University New Brunswick::Pham, H@Alcatel-Lucent@AT&T@Lucent Technologies@Rutgers State University New Brunswick",not exist,"no title+Basawa, I.

Replicating effects and biases,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313001317098220,AUG 2001,38,42,"One corm-non view is that a well-designed empirical study will reach conclusions that can be found again and again if the study is replicated, whereas a poorly designed study is unlikely to replicate. In opposition to this view, it is argued that a well-designed empirical study reaches conclusions that tend to replicate when correct and are less likely to replicate when incorrect, whereas in a poorly designed study the conclusions tend to replicate even when incorrect. In observational studies of treatment effects, the same hidden bias may occur repeatedly in a series of studies, so the studies reproduce the same distorted estimates of treatment effects. The purpose of this article is to point to strategies in research design that make it less likely that biased estimates will replicate, and to illustrate these strategies with examples. To replicate effects without replicating biases, vary the treatment assignment mechanism, so that the reasons subjects are spared treatment are different in the original and replicated studies. Also, vary the treatment envelope-that is, the ostensibly irrelevant features in which the treatment is packaged.","assignment mechanism,hidden bias,observational study,treatment envelope",CASE-CROSSOVER DESIGN,"Rosenbaum, PR@Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Dept Stat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Rosenbaum, PR@University of Pennsylvania","Rosenbaum, Paul@H-8687-2012","MIDDLETOWN-III - PROBLEMS OF REPLICATION, LONGITUDINAL MEASUREMENT, AND TRIANGULATION+BAHR, HM; CAPLOW, T; CHADWICK, BA+ANNUAL REVIEW OF SOCIOLOGY+1983::RADIATION-RELATED LEUKEMIA IN HIROSHIMA AND NAGASAKI 1946-1964 .I.

This article describes the incorporation of a studio lab component into undergraduate courses in introductory statistics. We detail the objectives of these courses and describe the motivations, general structure, and main features of our approach. The labs typically involve a two-step frequentist approach where a simple hands-on experiment is performed that is subsequently replicated using the computer. We describe in detail two labs that typify the main features of our approach, and discuss the flexibility of the labs with regard to the target audience. A discussion of our perception of their impact on student learning is given, along with some comments on alternative modes of delivery.","computer-based learning,hands-on experiments,situated learning,studio labs,teaching statistics",,"Cabilio, P@Acadia Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Wolfville, NS B0P 1X0, Canada@Carleton Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada::Farrell, PJ@Acadia Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Wolfville, NS B0P 1X0, Canada@Carleton Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada","Cabilio, P@Acadia University@Carleton University::Farrell, PJ@Acadia University@Carleton University",not exist,"A one-semester, laboratory-based, quality-oriented statistics curriculum for engineering students+Barton, RR; Nowack, CA+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 1998::Teaching introductory statistics courses so that nonstatisticians experience statistical reasoning+Bradstreet, TE+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+FEB 1996::no title+CABILIO P+STUDIO LABS APPL PRO+1999::no title+CABILIO P+STUDIO LABS STAT LIF+1999::no title+Chatterjee, S.; Handcock, M.

Graphical assessment of dependence: Is a picture worth 100 tests?,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313001317098248,AUG 2001,6,51,"Nonparametric tests of association have been around for a long time, and new ones continue to be proposed to cope with specific forms of association. However, graphs have the potential to assess a far richer class of bivariate dependence structures than any collection of tests.

Multiple imputation in practice: Comparison of software packages for regression models with missing variables,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,10.1198/000313001317098266,AUG 2001,41,257,"Missing data frequently complicates data analysis for scientific investigations. The development of statistical methods to address missing data has been an active area of research in recent decades. Multiple imputation, originally proposed by Rubin in a public use dataset setting, is a general purpose method for analyzing datasets with missing data that is broadly applicable to a variety of missing data settings. We review multiple imputation as an analytic strategy for missing data. We describe and evaluate a number of software packages that implement this procedure, and contrast the interface, features, and results. We compare the packages, and detail shortcomings and useful features. The comparisons are illustrated using examples from an artificial dataset and a study of child psychopathology. We suggest additional features as well as discuss limitations and cautions to consider when using multiple imputation as an analytic strategy for incomplete data settings.","generalized linear models,incomplete data,Markov chain Monte Carlo,missing outcomes,missing predictors","GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,CHILD PSYCHOPATHOLOGY,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,INCOMPLETE DATA,MENTAL-HEALTH,INFORMANTS,INFERENCE","Horton, NJ@Boston Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Boston, MA 02118 USA@Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02118 USA@Med Univ S Carolina, Dept Biometry & Epidemiol, Charleston, SC 29425 USA::Lipsitz, SR@Boston Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Boston, MA 02118 USA@Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02118 USA@Med Univ S Carolina, Dept Biometry & Epidemiol, Charleston, SC 29425 USA","Horton, NJ@Boston University@Boston University@Medical University of South Carolina::Lipsitz, SR@Boston University@Boston University@Medical University of South Carolina","Horton, Nicholas@A-2493-2008@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3332-4311","no title+Achenbach,, T.M.+Manual for the child behaviour checklist/4-18 and 1991 profile+1991::no title+Achenbach, T.
