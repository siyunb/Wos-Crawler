Product partition models with correlated parameters,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/11-BA626,2011,37,4,"In sequentially observed data, Bayesian partition models aim at partitioning the entire observation period into disjoint clusters. Each cluster is an aggregation of sequential observations and a simple model is adopted within each cluster. The main inferential problem is the estimation of the number and locations of the clusters. We extend the well-known product partition model (PPM) by assuming that observations within the same cluster have their distributions indexed by correlated and different parameters. Such parameters are similar within a cluster by means of a Gibbs prior distribution. We carried out several simulations and real data set analyses showing that our model provides better estimates for all parameters, including the number and position of the temporal clusters, even for situations favoring the PPM. A free and open source code is available.","Change point,Gibbs prior,MCMC,Temporal correlation","MULTIPLE CHANGEPOINT PROBLEMS,CHANGE POINT PROBLEMS,BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS,INFERENCE","Monteiro, Joao V.

Estimating a bivariate linear relationship,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/11-BA627,2011,33,2,"Solutions of the bivariate, linear errors-in-variables estimation problem with unspecified errors are expected to be invariant under interchange and scaling of the coordinates. The appealing model of normally distributed true values and errors is unidentified without additional information. I propose a prior density that incorporates the fact that the slope and variance parameters together determine the covariance matrix of the unobserved true values but is otherwise diffuse. The marginal posterior density of the slope is invariant to interchange and scaling of the coordinates and depends on the data only through the sample correlation coefficient and ratio of standard deviations. It covers the interval between the two ordinary least squares estimates but diminishes rapidly outside of it. I introduce the R package leiv for computing the posterior density, and I apply it to examples in astronomy and method comparison.","errors-in-variables,identifiability,measurement error,straight line fitting","STRAIGHT-LINES,VARIABLES,ERROR,SUBJECT,MODELS,REGRESSIONS,AGREEMENT","Leonard, David@Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Clin Sci, Dallas, TX 75390 USA","Leonard, David@University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Dallas@University of Texas System",not exist,"no title+no author+Handbook of Mathematical Functions With Formulas, Graphs, and Mathematical Tables+1964::Note on the method of least squares+Adcock, R.+Analyst+1877::no title+ADCOCK RJ+ANALYST+1878::MEASUREMENT IN MEDICINE - THE ANALYSIS OF METHOD COMPARISON STUDIES+ALTMAN, DG; BLAND, JM+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES D-THE STATISTICIAN+1983::no title+Anderson,, T.

Bayesian Cointegrated Vector Autoregression Models Incorporating alpha-stable Noise for Inter-day Price Movements Via Approximate Bayesian Computation.,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/11-BA628,2011,57,5,"We consider a statistical model for pairs of traded assets, based on a Cointegrated Vector Auto Regression (CVAR) Model. We extend standard CVAR models to incorporate estimation of model parameters in the presence of price series level shifts which are not accurately modeled in the standard Gaussian error correction model (ECM) framework. This involves developing a novel matrix-variate Bayesian CVAR mixture model, comprised of Gaussian errors intra-day and alpha-stable errors inter-day in the ECM framework. To achieve this we derive conjugate posterior models for the Scale Mixtures of Normals (SMiN CVAR) representation of alpha-stable inter-day innovations. These results are generalized to asymmetric intractable models for the innovation noise at inter-day boundaries allowing forskewed alpha-stable models via Approximate Bayesian computation.

Our proposed model and sampling methodology is general, incorporating the current CVAR literature on Gaussian models, whilst allowing for price series level shifts to occur either at random estimated time points or known a priori time points. We focus analysis on regularly observed non-Gaussian level shifts that can have significant effect on estimation performance in statistical models failing to account for such level shifts, such as at the close and open times of markets. We illustrate our model and the corresponding estimation procedures we develop on both synthetic and real data. The real data analysis investigates Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, five and ten year notes (bonds) and NASDAQ price series. In two studies we demonstrate the suitability of statistically modeling the heavy tailed noise processes for inter-day price shifts via an alpha-stable model. Then we fit the novel Bayesian matrix variate CVAR model developed, which incorporates a composite noise model for alpha-stable and matrix variate Gaussian errors, under both symmetric and non-symmetric alpha-stable assumptions.","Cointegrated Vector Autoregression,alpha-stable,Approximate Bayesian Computation","LIKELIHOOD-FREE INFERENCE,ERROR-CORRECTION MODEL,CHAIN MONTE-CARLO,OPERATIONAL RISK,ADAPTIVE MCMC,ALGORITHMS,SELECTION","Peters, Gareth W.@Univ New S Wales, Dept Math & Stat, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia::Kannan, Balakrishnan@Baronia Capital Pty Ltd, Crows Nest, NSW 2065, Australia::Lassock, Ben@Baronia Capital Pty Ltd, Crows Nest, NSW 2065, Australia::Mellen, Chris@Baronia Capital Pty Ltd, Crows Nest, NSW 2065, Australia::Godsill, Simon@Univ Cambridge, Dept Elect Engn, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England","Peters, Gareth W.@University of New South Wales Sydney::Kannan, Balakrishnan@Unknow::Lassock, Ben@Unknow::Mellen, Chris@Unknow::Godsill, Simon@University of Cambridge","Peters, Gareth@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2768-8979","Stochastic Trends and Cointegration in the Market for Equities+Ackert, L.

A Computational Bayesian Method for Estimating the Number of Knots In Regression Splines,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/11-BA629,2011,62,2,"To determine the size of the drug-involved offender population that could be served effectively and efficiently by partnerships between courts and treatment in the United States, a synthetic dataset is created by Bhati and Roman (2009). Because of hidden structure and aggregation necessary to create variables, there exists latent variance that can not be explained fully by a normal random effect model. Semiparametric regression is a well-known and frequently used tool to capture the functional dependence between variables with fixed effect parametric and nonlinear regression. A new Gibbs sampler is developed here for the number and positions of knots in regression splines by expressing semiparametric regression as a linear mixed model with a random effect term for the basis functions. Our Gibbs sampler exploits the properties of the multinomial-Dirichlet distribution, and is shown to be an improvement, in terms of operator norm and efficiency, over add/delete one MCMC algorithms. We find that the Dirichlet distribution with small values of the parameters results in a smaller number of knots and, in general, good fit to the data. This approach is shown to reveal previously unseen structures in the synthetic dataset of Bhati and Roman.","Regression Splines,Multinomial-Dirichlet distribution,Bayesian Semiparametric Regression","GAUSS-MARKOV THEOREM,MIXED-EFFECTS MODELS,SEMIPARAMETRIC REGRESSION,LINEAR-MODELS,INFERENCE,COEFFICIENTS,PENALTIES,MIXTURES,NOISY","Kyung, Minjung@Duksung Womens Univ Seol, Dept Stat, Seoul, South Korea","Kyung, Minjung@Duksung Women's University",not exist,"no title+ARONSZAJN N+T AM MATH SOC+1950::Empirical Investigation of ""Going to Scale"" in Drug Interventions in the United States, 1990, 2003 [Computer file]+Bhati, A.

Bayesian clustering in decomposable graphs,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/11-BA630,2011,30,5,"In this paper we propose a class of prior distributions on decomposable graphs, allowing for improved modeling flexibility. While existing methods solely penalize the number of edges, the proposed work empowers practitioners to control clustering, level of separation, and other features of the graph. Emphasis is placed on a particular prior distribution which derives its motivation from the class of product partition models; the properties of this prior relative to existing priors are examined through theory and simulation. We then demonstrate the use of graphical models in the field of agriculture, showing how the proposed prior distribution alleviates the inflexibility of previous approaches in properly modeling the interactions between the yield of different crop varieties. Lastly, we explore American voting data, comparing the voting patterns amongst the states over the last century.","decomposable graphs,Bayesian analysis,product partition models,agriculture,clustering,American voting","PRODUCT PARTITION MODELS,CHANGE POINT PROBLEMS,NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS,SELECTION,LASSO","Bornn, Luke@Univ British Columbia, Dept Stat, Vancouver, BC V6T 1W5, Canada::Caron, Francois@Univ Bordeaux, Inst Math Bordeaux, INRIA Bordeaux Sud Ouest, Bordeaux, France","Bornn, Luke@University of British Columbia::Caron, Francois@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)@Communaute d'Universites et Etablissements d'Aquitaine (ComUE)@Inria",not exist,"MIXTURES OF DIRICHLET PROCESSES WITH APPLICATIONS TO BAYESIAN NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS+ANTONIAK, CE+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1974::Bayesian covariance matrix estimation using a mixture of decomposable graphical models+Armstrong, Helen; Carter, Christopher K.; Wong, Kin Foon Kevin; et al.+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+SEP 2009::PRODUCT PARTITION MODELS FOR CHANGE POINT PROBLEMS+BARRY, D; HARTIGAN, JA+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+MAR 1992::A BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS FOR CHANGE POINT PROBLEMS+BARRY, D; HARTIGAN, JA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::Efficient Stabilization of Crop Yield Prediction in the Canadian Prairies+Bornn, L.; Zidek, J.+Technical Report 258+2010::An efficient computational approach for prior sensitivity analysis and cross-validation+Bornn, Luke; Doucet, Arnaud; Gottardo, Raphael+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+MAR 2010::no title+Carr, A.+Presidential Elections 1789-2000+2005::Objective Bayesian model selection in Gaussian graphical models+Carvalho, C.; Scott, J.+Biometrika+2009::Product partition models for normal means+Crowley, EM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1997::Hyper-Markov Laws in the Statistical Analysis of Decomposable Graphical Models+Dawid, A.; Lauritzen, S.+Annals of Statistics+1993::COVARIANCE SELECTION+DEMPSTER, AP+BIOMETRICS+1972::Sparse graphical models for exploring gene expression data+Dobra, A; Hans, C; Jones, B; et al.+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+JUL 2004::BAYESIAN ANALYSIS OF SOME NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS+FERGUSON, TS+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1973::Sparse inverse covariance estimation with the graphical lasso+Friedman, Jerome; Hastie, Trevor; Tibshirani, Robert+BIOSTATISTICS+JUL 2008::Decomposable graphical Gaussian model determination+Giudici, P; Green, PJ+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1999::Global prior distributions for the analysis of discrete graphical models.+Giudici, P.; Tarantola, C.+Statistical Methods and Applications+1996::PARTITION MODELS+HARTIGAN, JA+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1990::Experiments in stochastic computation for high-dimensional graphical models+Jones, B; Carvalho, C; Dobra, A; et al.+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+NOV 2005::no title+Koller, D.; Friedman, N.+Probabilistic Graphical Models: Principles and Techniques+2009::Bayesian model-based clustering procedures+Lau, John W.; Green, Peter J.+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+SEP 2007::no title+Lauritzen,, S.

Examples are Asymmetric Laplace, Skew Normal and Generalized Extreme Value distributions. Such models suffer from the difficulty that the parameter updates do not admit closed form solutions. We circumvent this problem through a combination of (a) specially tailored auxiliary variables, (b) univariate quadrature schemes and (c) finite mixture approximations of troublesome density functions.

Bayesian Nonparametric Modelling of the Return Distribution with Stochastic Volatility,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/11-BA632,2011,37,16,"This paper presents a method for Bayesian nonparametric analysis of the return distribution in a stochastic volatility model. The distribution of the logarithm of the squared return is flexibly modelled using an infinite mixture of Normal distributions. This allows efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to be developed. Links between the return distribution and the distribution of the logarithm of the squared returns are discussed. The method is applied to simulated data, one asset return series and one stock index return series. We find that estimates of volatility using the model can differ dramatically from those using a Normal return distribution if there is evidence of a heavy-tailed return distribution.","Dirichlet process,Asset Return,Stock Index,Off-set mixture representation,Mixture model,Centred representation","MONTE-CARLO METHODS,LIKELIHOOD INFERENCE,DENSITY-ESTIMATION,MIXTURES,LEVERAGE,TAILS","Delatola, Eleni-Ioanna@Univ Kent, Sch Math Stat & Actuarial Sci, Canterbury, Kent, England::Griffin, Jim E.@Univ Kent, Sch Math Stat & Actuarial Sci, Canterbury, Kent, England","Delatola, Eleni-Ioanna@University of Kent::Griffin, Jim E.@University of Kent",not exist,"Robust Bayesian analysis of heavy-tailed stochastic volatility models using scale mixtures of normal distributions+Abanto-Valle, C.

For demonstration, we apply the technique to data from a previous paper, which investigated the presence of dipolar ferromagnetism in assemblies of ferromagnetic Co nanoparticles. Bayesian analysis confirms the presence of multiparticle dipolar domains even at zero magnetic field, but higher-field correlation lengths were found to be much smaller than previously believed, yielding new information on the maximum length scale which the instrument can reliably probe. We use two complementary types of graph to visualize the results. Plots of standardized residual distributions show quality of fit, and guide model refinement.

Default priors for density estimation with mixture models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/10-BA502,2010,28,14,"The infinite mixture of normals model has become a popular method for density estimation problems. This paper proposes an alternative hierarchical model that leads to hyperparameters that can be interpreted as the location, scale and smoothness of the density. The priors on other parts of the model have little effect on the density estimates and can be given default choices. Automatic Bayesian density estimation can be implemented by using uninformative priors for location and scale and default priors for the smoothness.

Hierarchical Bayesian Analysis of the Seemingly Unrelated Regression and Simultaneous Equations Models Using a Combination of Direct Monte Carlo and Importance Sampling Techniques,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/10-BA503,2010,44,18,"Computationally efficient simulation methods for hierarchical Bayesian analysis of the seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) and simultaneous equations models (SEM) are proposed and applied. These methods combine a direct Monte Carlo (DMC) approach and an importance sampling procedure to calculate Bayesian estimation and prediction results, namely, Bayesian posterior densities for parameters, predictive densities for future values of variables and associated moments, intervals and other quantities. The results obtained by our approach are compared to those yielded by use of MCMC techniques. Finally, we show that our algorithm can be applied to the Bayesian analysis of state space models.","Bayesian estimation and Prediction,Direct Monte Carlo,Hierarchical Priors Importance sampling,Markov Chain Monte Carlo","REDUCED RANK,CONVERGENCE,BIAS","Ando, Tomohiro@Keio Univ, Grad Sch Business Adm, Tokyo, Japan::Zellner, Arnold@Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Ando, Tomohiro@Keio University::Zellner, Arnold@University of Chicago",not exist,"Special issue editors' introduction: The interface between econometrics and economic theory+Aliprantis, Charalambos D.; Barnett, William A.; Cornet, Bernard; et al.+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+FEB 2007::Bayesian predictive information criterion for the evaluation of hierarchical Bayesian and empirical Bayes models+Ando, Tomohiro+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 2007::A NOTE ON THE STATISTICAL TESTABILITY OF EXPLICIT CAUSAL CHAINS AGAINST THE CLASS OF INTERDEPENDENT MODELS+BASMANN, RL+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1965::no title+BOX, G.

Analyzing Spatial Point Patterns Subject to Measurement Error,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/10-BA504,2010,35,10,"We address the issue of inference for a noisy point pattern. The unobserved true point process is modelled as a nonhomogeneous Poisson process. For modeling the underlying intensity surface we use a scaled Gaussian mixture distribution. The noise that creeps in during the measurement procedure causes random displacement of the true locations. We consider two settings. Witha bounded region of interest, (i) this displacement may cause a true location within the boundary to be associated with an 'observed' location outside of the region and thus missed and (ii) we have the possibility in (i) but also vice versa; the displacement may bring in an observed location whose true location lies outside the region. Under (i), we can only lose points and, depending on the variability in the measurement error as well as the number of true locations closeto boundary, this can cause a significant number of locations to be lost from our recorded set of data. Estimation of the intensity surface from the observed data can be misleading especially near the boundary of our domain of interest. Under (ii), the modeling problem is more didifficult; points can be both lost and gained and it is challenging to characterize how we may gain points with no data on the underly-ingintensity outside the domain of interest. In both cases, we work within a hierarchical Bayes framework, modelingthelatentpointpatternusingaCoxprocessand, given the process realization, introducing a suitable measurement error model. Hence, the specification includes the true number of points as an unknown. we discuss choice of measurement error model as well as identifiability problems which arise. Models are fitted using an markov chain Monte Carlo implementation. After validating our method against several synthetic datasets we illustrate its application for two ecological datasets.","Gaussian mixture model,measurement error model,intensity surface,Markov chain Monte Carlo,Neymann-Scott process,nonhomogeneous Poisson process","BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS,SURVIVAL-DATA,MODELS,EPIDEMIOLOGY","Chakraborty, Avishek@Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC 27710 USA::Gelfand, Alan E.@Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC 27710 USA","Chakraborty, Avishek@Duke University::Gelfand, Alan E.@Duke University",not exist,"no title+no author+Case Studies in Spatial Point Process Modeling+2005::NEAREST-NEIGHBOUR MARKOV POINT-PROCESSES AND RANDOM SETS+BADDELEY, A; MOLLER, J+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+AUG 1989::Stochastic geometry models in high level vision+Baddeley, A.

Bayesian Functional ANOVA Modeling Using Gaussian Process Prior Distributions,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/10-BA505,2010,33,44,"Functional analysis of variance (ANOVA) models partition a functional response according to the main effects and interactions of various factors. This article develops a general framework for functional ANOVA modeling from a Bayesian viewpoint, assigning Gaussian process prior distributions to each batch of functional effects. We discuss the choices to be made in specifying such a model, advocating the treatment of levels within a given factor as dependent but exchangeable quantities, and we suggest weakly informative prior distributions for higher level parameters that may be appropriate in many situations. We discuss computationally efficient strategies for posterior sampling using Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms, and we emphasize useful graphical summaries based on the posterior distribution of model-based analogues of traditional ANOVA decompositions of variance. We illustrate this process of model specification, posterior sampling, and graphical posterior summaries in two examples. The first considers the effect of geographic region on the temperature profiles at weather stations in Canada. The second example examines sources of variability in the output of regional climate models from a designed experiment.","Analysis of variance,Climate models,Functional data,Variance components","SMOOTHING SPLINE,IMPROPER PRIORS,MIXED MODELS,VARIANCE","Kaufman, Cari G.@Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Stat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA::Sain, Stephan R.@Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Geophys Stat Project, Boulder, CO 80307 USA","Kaufman, Cari G.@University of California System@University of California Berkeley::Sain, Stephan R.@National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA",not exist,"no title+no author+HDB MATH FUNCTIONS+1967::An empirical Bayes approach to growth curve analysis+Barry, D+STATISTICIAN+1996::Objective Bayesian analysis of spatially correlated data+Berger, JO; De Oliveira, V; Sanso, B+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2001::no title+BLIER W+ENCY CLIMATE WEATHER+1996::Smoothing spline models for the analysis of nested and crossed samples of curves+Brumback, BA; Rice, JA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1998::PRUDENCE Employs New Methods to Assess European Climate Change+Christensen, J.; Carter, T.; Giorgi, F.+EOS, Transactions-American Geophysical Union+2002::INVARIANT DISTRIBUTIONS AND ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE MODELS+DAWID, AP+BIOMETRIKA+1977::An intercomparison of regional climate simulations for Europe: assessing uncertainties in model projections+Deque, M.; Rowell, D.

The Bayesian Elastic Net,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/10-BA506,2010,26,76,"Elastic net (Zou and Hastie 2005) is a flexible regularization and variable selection method that uses a mixture of L(1) and L(2) penalties. It is particularly useful when there are much more predictors than the sample size. This paper proposes a Bayesian method to solve the elastic net model using a Gibbs sampler. While the marginal posterior mode of the regression coefficients is equivalent to estimates given by the non-Bayesian elastic net, the Bayesian elastic net has two major advantages. Firstly, as a Bayesian method, the distributional results on the estimates are straight forward, making the statistical inference easier. Secondly, it chooses the two penalty parameters simultaneously, avoiding the ""double shrinkage problem"" in the elastic net method. Real data examples and simulation studies show that the Bayesian elastic net behaves comparably in prediction accuracy but performs better in variable selection.","Bayesian analysis,elastic net,Gibbs sampler,regularization,variable selection","VARIABLE SELECTION,LASSO,REGRESSION","Li, Qing@Washington Univ, Dept Math, St Louis, MO 63130 USA::Lin, Nan@Washington Univ, Dept Math, St Louis, MO 63130 USA","Li, Qing@Washington University (WUSTL)::Lin, Nan@Washington University (WUSTL)",not exist,"SCALE MIXTURES OF NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS+ANDREWS, DF; MALLOWS, CL+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1974::no title+ARMIDO D+ACM T MATH SOFTWARE+1986::no title+Berger, J.

A Bayesian Image Analysis of Radiation Induced Changes in Tumor Vascular Permeability,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/10-BA508,2010,31,2,"This work is motivated by a quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging study of the relative change in tumor vascular permeability during the course of radiation therapy. The differences in tumor and healthy brain tissue physiology and pathology constitute a notable feature of the image data-spatial heterogeneity with respect to its contrast uptake profile (a surrogate for permeability) and radiation induced changes in this profile. To account for these spatial aspects of the data, we employ a Gaussian hidden Markov random field (MRF) model. The model incorporates a latent set of discrete labels from the MRF governed by a spatial regularization parameter. We estimate the MRF regularization parameter and treat the number of MRF states as a random variable and estimate it via a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We conduct simulation studies to examine the performance of the model and compare it with a recently proposed method using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Simulation results show that the Bayesian algorithm performs as well, if not slightly better than the EM based algorithm. Results on real data suggest that the tumor ""core"" vascular permeability increases relative to healthy tissue three weeks after starting radiotherapy, which may be an opportune time to initiate chemotherapy and warrants further investigation.","hidden Markov random fields,Mann Whitney U statistic,Quantitative,Magnetic Resonance Imaging,reversible jump MCMC,Swendsen-Wang algorithm,Image Analysis,quantitative MRI","MARKOV RANDOM-FIELDS,FUNCTIONAL DIFFUSION MAP,REVERSIBLE JUMP,UNKNOWN NUMBER,SEGMENTATION,MODELS,SIMULATIONS,COMPONENTS,BIOMARKER,GENETICS","Zhang, Xiaoxi@Pfizer Inc, New York, NY 10017 USA::Johnson, Timothy D.@Univ Michigan, Dept Biostat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA::Little, Roderick J.

"Shrinkage Regression for Multivariate Inference with Missing Data, and an Application to Portfolio Balancing",BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/10-BA602,2010,41,7,"Portfolio balancing requires estimates of covariance between asset returns. Returns data have histories which greatly vary in length, since assets begin public trading at different times. This can lead to a huge amount of missing data-too much for the conventional imputation-based approach. Fortunately, a well-known factorization of the MVN likelihood under the prevailing historical missingness pattern leads to a simple algorithm of OLS regressions that is much more reliable. When there are more assets than returns, however, OLS becomes unstable. Gramacy et al. (2008) showed how classical shrinkage regression may be used instead, thus extending the state of the art to much bigger asset collections, with further accuracy and interpretation advantages. In this paper, we detail a fully Bayesian hierarchical formulation that extends the frame work further by allowing for heavy-tailed errors, relaxing the historical missingness assumption, and accounting for estimation risk. We illustrate how this approach compares favorably to the classical one using synthetic data and an investment exercise with real returns. An accompanying R package is on CRAN.","multivariate,monotone missing data,data augmentation,ridge regression,double-exponential,heavytails,factor model,portfolio balancing","ESTIMATION RISK,SELECTION,MODEL,LASSO,COVARIANCE","Gramacy, Robert B.@Univ Cambridge, Dept Pure Math & Math Stat, Cambridge CB2 1SB, England::Pantaleo, Ester@Univ Bari, Dipartimento Fis, Bari, Italy","Gramacy, Robert B.@University of Cambridge::Pantaleo, Ester@University of Bari",not exist,"MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATES FOR A MULTIVARIATE NORMAL-DISTRIBUTION WHEN SOME OBSERVATIONS ARE MISSING+ANDERSON, TW+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1957::EFFECT OF ESTIMATION RISK ON CAPITAL-MARKET EQUILIBRIUM+BROWN, S+JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL AND QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS+1979::INFERENCE FOR NONCONJUGATE BAYESIAN MODELS USING THE GIBBS SAMPLER+CARLIN, BP; POLSON, NG+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+DEC 1991::A MONTE-CARLO APPROACH TO NONNORMAL AND NONLINEAR STATE-SPACE MODELING+CARLIN, BP; POLSON, NG; STOFFER, DS+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1992::no title+CARVALHO C+200831 DUK U DEP STA+2008::Objective Bayesian model selection in Gaussian graphical models+Carvalho, C.

A General Purpose Sampling Algorithm for Continuous Distributions (the t-walk),BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/10-BA603,2010,30,30,"We develop a new general purpose MCMC sampler for arbitrary continuous distributions that requires no tuning. We call this MCMC the t-walk. The t-walk maintains two independent points in the sample space, and all moves are based on proposals that are then accepted with a standard Metropolis-Hastings acceptance probability on the product space. Hence the t-walk is provably convergent under the usual mild requirements. We restrict proposal distributions, or 'moves', to those that produce analgorithm that is invariant to scale, and approximately invariant to affine transformations of the state space. Hence scaling of proposals, and erectively also coordinate transformations, that might be used to increase efficiency of the sampler, are not needed since the t-walk's operation is identical on any scaled version of the target distribution. Four moves are given that result in an erective sampling algorithm.

We use the simple device of up dating only a random subset of coordinates at each step to allow application of the t-walk to high-dimensional problems. In a series of test problems across dimensions we find that the t-walk is only a small factor lesse efficient than optimally tuned algorithms, but significantly outperforms general random-walk M-H samplers that are not tuned for specific problems. Further, thet-walk remains erective for target distributions for which no optimal affine transformation exists such as those where correlation structure is very different in differing regions of state space.

Several examples are presented showing good mixing and convergence characteristics, varying in dimensions from 1 to 200 and with radically different scale and correlation structure, using exactly the same sampler. The t-walk is available for R, Python, at Lab and C++ at http://www.cimat.mx/similar to jac/twalk/.","MCMC,Bayesian inference,simulation,t-walk","CHAIN MONTE-CARLO,METROPOLIS-HASTINGS,REGENERATION","Andres Christen, J.@Ctr Invest Matemat CIMAT, Guanajuato, Mexico::Fox, Colin@Univ Otago, Dept Phys, Christchurch, New Zealand","Andres Christen, J.@CIMAT - Centro de Investigacion en Matematicas::Fox, Colin@University of Otago","Christen, J Andres@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5795-4345::Fox, Colin@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9278-1777","A tutorial on adaptive MCMC+Andrieu, Christophe; Thoms, Johannes+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+DEC 2008::no title+BAI Y+0806 U TOR DEP STAT+2008::Constrained bearings-only target motion analysis via Markov chain Monte Carlo methods+Bavencoff, Frederic; Vanpeperstraete, Jean-Michel; Le Cadre, J. -Pierre+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AEROSPACE AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS+OCT 2006::Carbon-14 wiggle-match dating of peat deposits: advantages and limitations+Blaauw, M; Van Geel, B; Mauquoy, D; et al.+JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE+FEB 2004::Radiocarbon peat chronologies and environmental change+Blaauw, M; Christen, JA+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2005::Identification of regeneration times in MCMC simulation, with application to adaptive schemes+Brockwell, AE; Kadane, JB+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+JUN 2005::no title+EIDSVIK J+STAT COMPUT+2004::Using Bayesian inference for parameter estimation when the system response and experimental conditions are measured with error and some variables are considered as nuisance variables+Emery, A.

Bayesian Denity Regression with Logistic Gaussian Process and Subspace Projection,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/10-BA605,2010,29,20,"We develop a novel Bayesian density regression model based on logistic Gaussian processes and subspace projection. Logistic Gaussian processes provide an attractive alternative to the popular stick-breaking processes for modeling a family of conditional densities that vary smoothly in the conditioning variable. Subspace projection offers dimension reduction of predictors through multiple linear combinations, offering an alternative to the zeroing out theme of variable selection. We illustrate that logistic Gaussian processes and subspace projection combine well to produce a computationally tractable and theoretically sound density regression procedure that offers good out of sample prediction, accurate estimation of subspace projection and satisfactory estimation of subspace dimensionality. We also demonstrate that subspace projection may lead to better prediction than variable selection when predictors are well chosen and possibly dependent on each other, each having a moderate influence on the response.","Bayesian Inference,Semiparametric Model,Posterior Consistency,Gaussian Process,Markov Chain Monte Carlo,Dimension Reduction","SLICED INVERSE REGRESSION,CENTRAL MEAN SUBSPACE,DENSITY-ESTIMATION,POSTERIOR CONSISTENCY,DIMENSION REDUCTION,PROCESS PRIORS","Tokdar, Surya T.@Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC 27710 USA::Zhu, Yu M.@Purdue Univ, Dept Stat, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA::Ghosh, Jayanta K.@Purdue Univ, Dept Stat, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA@Indian Stat Inst, Div Theoret Stat & Math, Kolkata, India","Tokdar, Surya T.@Duke University::Zhu, Yu M.@Purdue University@Purdue University System::Ghosh, Jayanta K.@Indian Statistical Institute@Purdue University@Purdue University System@Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata",not exist,"The Gaussian process density sampler+Adams, R.; Murray, I.; MacKay, D.+ADV NEURAL INFORM PR+2009::Stationary process approximation for the analysis of large spatial datasets+Banerjee, Sudipto; Gelfand, Alan E.; Finley, Andrew O.; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2008::Can SIR be as popular as multiple linear regression?+Chen, CH; Li, KC+STATISTICA SINICA+APR 1998::Marginal likelihood from the Metropolis-Hastings output+Chib, S; Jeliazkov, I+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2001::Nonparametric Bayes Conditional Distribution Modeling With Variable Selection+Chung, Yeonseung; Dunson, David B.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2009::SLICED INVERSE REGRESSION FOR DIMENSION REDUCTION - COMMENT+COOK, RD; WEISBERG, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1991::Using dimensionreduction subspaces to identify important inputs in models of physical systems+Cook, RD.+Proc.

Model-based Clustering of Categorical Time Series,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/10-BA606,2010,29,8,Two approaches for model-based clustering of categorical time series based on time-homogeneous first-order Markov chains are discussed. For Markov chain clustering the individual transition probabilities are fixed to a group-specific transition matrix. In a new approach called Dirichlet multinomial clustering the rows of the individual transition matrices deviate from the group mean and follow a Dirichlet distribution with unknown group-specific hyperparameters. Estimation is carried out through Markov chain Monte Carlo. Various well-known clustering criteria are applied to select the number of groups.

"Penalized Regression, Standard Errors, and Bayesian Lassos",BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/10-BA607,2010,42,142,"Penalized regression methods for simultaneous variables election and coefficient estimation, especially those based on the lasso of Tibshirani (1996), have received a great deal of attention in recent years, mostly through frequentist models. Properties such as consistency have been studied, and are achieved by different lasso variations. Here we look at a fully Bayesian formulation of the problem, which is flexible enough to encompass most versions of the lasso that have been previously considered. The advantages of the hierarchical Bayesian formulations are many. In addition to the usual ease-of-interpretation of hierarchical models, the Bayesian formulation produces valid standard errors (which can be problematic for the frequentist lasso), and is based on a geometrically ergodic Markov chain. We compare the performance of the Bayesian lassos to their frequentist counterparts using simulations, data sets that previous lasso papers have used, and a difficult modeling problem for predicting the collapse of governments around the world. In terms of prediction mean squared error, the Bayesian lasso performance is similar to and, in some cases, better than, the frequentist lasso.","Hierarchical Models,Gibbs Sampling,Geometric Ergodicity,Variable Selection","VARIABLE SELECTION,LOGISTIC-REGRESSION,ORACLE PROPERTIES,MODEL SELECTION,BOOTSTRAP,GIBBS,DISTRIBUTIONS,ESTIMATORS","Kyung, Minjung@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA::Gill, Jeff@Washington Univ, Dept Polit Sci, St Louis, MO USA::Ghosh, Malay@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA::Casella, George@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Kyung, Minjung@State University System of Florida@University of Florida::Gill, Jeff@Washington University (WUSTL)::Ghosh, Malay@State University System of Florida@University of Florida::Casella, George@State University System of Florida@University of Florida",not exist,"SCALE MIXTURES OF NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS+ANDREWS, DF; MALLOWS, CL+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1974::Gene selection using a two-level hierarchical Bayesian model+Bae, K; Mallick, BK+BIOINFORMATICS+DEC 12 2004::ESTIMATED SAMPLING DISTRIBUTIONS - THE BOOTSTRAP AND COMPETITORS+BERAN, R+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1982::Empirical Bayes Gibbs sampling.+Casella, G+Biostatistics (Oxford, England)+2001-Dec::no title+CASELLA G+RECONCILING MODEL SE+2009::Least angle regression+Efron, B; Hastie, T; Johnstone, I; et al.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2004::1977 RIETZ LECTURE - BOOTSTRAP METHODS - ANOTHER LOOK AT THE JACKKNIFE+EFRON, B+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1979::no title+ESTY DC+5 SCI APPL INT CORP+1999::Variable selection via nonconcave penalized likelihood and its oracle properties+Fan, JQ; Li, RZ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2001::Adaptive sparseness for supervised learning+Figueiredo, MAT+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE+SEP 2003::A STATISTICAL VIEW OF SOME CHEMOMETRICS REGRESSION TOOLS+FRANK, IE; FRIEDMAN, JH+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 1993::Penalized regressions: The bridge versus the lasso+Fu, WJJ+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+SEP 1998::Large-scale Bayesian logistic regression for text categorization+Genkin, Alexander; Lewis, David D.; Madigan, David+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 2007::Functional compatibility, Markov chains, and Gibbs sampling with improper posteriors+Hobert, JP; Casella, G+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+MAR 1998::Geometric ergodicity of Gibbs and block Gibbs samplers for a hierarchical random effects model+Hobert, JP+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+NOV 1998::no title+HOERL AE+TECHNOMETRICS+1970::no title+Hosmer, D; Lemeshow, S.+Applied logistic regression+2000::Blockwise sparse regression+Kim, Y; Kim, J; Kim, Y+STATISTICA SINICA+APR 2006::Improving forecasts of state failure+King, G; Zeng, L+WORLD POLITICS+JUL 2001::Asymptotics for Lasso-type estimators+Knight, K; Fu, WJ+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+OCT 2000::Model selection and inference: Facts and fiction+Leeb, H; Potscher, BM+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+FEB 2005::no title+Lehmann, E.

Measuring Statistical Significance for Full Bayesian Methods in Microarray Analyses,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/10-BA608,2010,22,2,"Full Bayesian methods are useful tools to account for complex data structures in high-throughput data analyses. The Bayesian FDR, which is the posterior proportion of false positives relative to the total number of rejections, has been widely used to measure statistical significance for full Bayesian methods in microarray analyses. However, the Bayesian FDR is sensitive to prior specification and it is incomparable to the resampling-based FDR estimates employed by most frequentist and empirical Bayesian methods. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm to evaluate the statistical significance for full Bayesian methods in there sampling-based frame work. The resulting predictive Bayesian FDR is robust to priorspecifications and it can produce a more accurate estimate of error rate. In addition, the proposed approach provides a general frame work for the objective comparison of performance between full Bayesian methods and the other frequentist and empirical Bayes methods in microarray analyses, which has been an unaddressed issue. A simulation study and a real data example are presented.","FDR,Bayesian models,microarray analysis,resampling method,statistical significance","DIFFERENTIAL GENE-EXPRESSION,FALSE DISCOVERY RATE,EMPIRICAL BAYES,PROFILES,MODEL","Cao, Jing@So Methodist Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Dallas, TX 75275 USA::Zhang, Song@Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Clin Sci, Dallas, TX 75390 USA","Cao, Jing@Southern Methodist University::Zhang, Song@University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Dallas@University of Texas System",not exist,"CONTROLLING THE FALSE DISCOVERY RATE - A PRACTICAL AND POWERFUL APPROACH TO MULTIPLE TESTING+BENJAMINI, Y; HOCHBERG, Y+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1995::Bayesian optimal discovery procedure for simultaneous significance testing+Cao, J; Xie, XJ; Zhang, S<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Whitehurst, A; White, M</span>.+BMC Bioinformatics+2009::Improved statistical tests for differential gene expression by shrinking variance components estimates+Cui, XG; Hwang, JTG; Qiu, J; et al.+BIOSTATISTICS+JAN 2005::A Bayesian mixture model for differential gene expression+Do, KA; Muller, P; Tang, F+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2005::Empirical Bayes analysis of a microarray experiment+Efron, B; Tibshirani, R; Storey, JD; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2001::Microarrays, empirical Bayes and the two-groups model+Efron, Bradley+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+FEB 2008::no title+Ferguson, T.+A Course in Large Sample Theory+1996::Operating characteristics and extensions of the false discovery rate procedure+Genovese, C; Wasserman, L+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2002::Gene-expression profiles in hereditary breast cancer.+Hedenfalk, I; Duggan, D; Chen, YD; et al.+NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE+FEB 22 2001::On parametric empirical Bayes methods for comparing multiple groups using replicated gene expression profiles+Kendziorski, CM; Newton, MA; Lan, H; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+DEC 30 2003::no title+LEWIN A+BIOMETRICS+2006::Hierarchical Bayes models for cDNA microarray gene expression+Lonnstedt, I; Britton, T+BIOSTATISTICS+APR 2005::Replicated microarray data+Lonnstedt, I; Speed, T+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 2002::FDR and Bayesian multiple comparisons rules+Muller, P; Parmigiani, G; Rice, K.+Bayesian statistics+2007::Optimal sample size for multiple testing: The case of gene expression microarrays+Muller, P; Parmigiani, G; Robert, C; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2004::Detecting differential gene expression with a semiparametric hierarchical mixture method+Newton, MA; Noueiry, A; Sarkar, D; et al.+BIOSTATISTICS+APR 2004::THE BAYESIAN BOOTSTRAP+RUBIN, DB+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1981::Linear models and empirical bayes methods for assessing differential expression in microarray experiments+Smyth, GK.+Stat Appl Genet Mol Biol+2004::A direct approach to false discovery rates+Storey, JD+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2002::Statistical significance for genomewide studies+Storey, JD; Tibshirani, R+PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA+AUG 5 2003::The optimal discovery procedure for large-scale significance testing, with applications to comparative microarray experiments+Storey, John D.; Dai, James Y.; Leek, Jeffrey T.+BIOSTATISTICS+APR 2007::Significance analysis of microarrays applied to the ionizing radiation response+Tusher, VG; Tibshirani, R; Chu, G+PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA+APR 24 2001"
Selection Sampling from Large Data Sets for Targeted Inference in Mixture Modeling,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/10-BA517,2010,19,8,"One of the challenges in using Markov chain Monte Carlo for model analysis in studies with very large datasets is the need to scan through the whole data at each iteration of the sampler, which can be computationally prohibitive. Several approaches have been developed to address this, typically drawing computationally manageable subsamples of the data. Here we consider the specific case where most of the data from a mixture model provides little or no information about the parameters of interest, and we aim to select subsamples such that the information extracted is most relevant. The motivating application arises in flow cytometry, where several measurements from a vast number of cells are available. Interest lies in identifying specific rare cell subtypes and characterizing them according to their corresponding markers. We present a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach where an initial subsample of the full dataset is used to guide selection sampling of a further set of observations targeted at a scientifically interesting, low probability region. We define a Sequential Monte Carlo strategy in which the targeted subsample is augmented sequentially as estimates improve, and introduce a stopping rule for determining the size of the targeted subsample. An example from flow cytometry illustrates the ability of the approach to increase the resolution of inferences for rare cell subtypes.","Flow cytometry,large data sets,mixture models,rare events,resampling,selection sampling,sequential Monte Carlo","MONTE-CARLO METHOD,BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS,MASSIVE DATASETS","Manolopoulou, Ioanna@Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC 27710 USA::Chan, Cliburn@Duke Univ, Dept Biostat & Bioinformat, Durham, NC USA::West, Mike@Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC 27710 USA","Manolopoulou, Ioanna@Duke University::Chan, Cliburn@Duke University::West, Mike@Duke University","Manolopoulou, Ioanna@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5379-2916","A One-Pass Sequential Monte Carlo Method for Bayesian Analysis of Massive Datasets+Balakrishnan, Suhrid; Madigan, David+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2006::Robust Bayesian analysis of selection models+Bayarri, MJ; Berger, J+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 1998::no title+CARVALHO CM+STAT SCI IN PRESS+2010::Statistical mixture modeling for cell subtype identification in flow cytometry+Chan, Cliburn; Feng, Feng; Ottinger, Janet; et al.+CYTOMETRY PART A+AUG 2008::A sequential particle filter method for static models+Chopin, N+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 2002::no title+Doucet, A; Freitas, ND; Gordon, N.+Sequential Monte Carlo methods in practice+2001::NOVEL-APPROACH TO NONLINEAR NON-GAUSSIAN BAYESIAN STATE ESTIMATION+GORDON, NJ; SALMOND, DJ; SMITH, AFM+IEE PROCEEDINGS-F RADAR AND SIGNAL PROCESSING+APR 1993::SAMPLE SELECTION BIAS AS A SPECIFICATION ERROR+HECKMAN, JJ+ECONOMETRICA+1979::Approximate Dirichlet process computing in finite normal mixtures: Smoothing and prior information+Ishwaran, H; James, LF+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+SEP 2002::Combine parameter and state estimation in simulation based filtering+Liu, J.; West, M.+SEQUENTIAL MONTE CAR+2000::Estimating mixture of Dirichlet process models+MacEachern, SN; Muller, P+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+JUN 1998::Bayesian curve fitting using multivariate normal mixtures+Muller, P; Erkanli, A; West, M+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1996::Automated high-dimensional flow cytometric data analysis+Pyne, Saumyadipta; Hu, Xinli; Wang, Kui; et al.+PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA+MAY 26 2009::A sequential Monte Carlo method for Bayesian analysis of massive datasets+Ridgeway, G; Madigan, D+DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY+JUL 2003::T-cell quality in memory and protection: implications for vaccine design+Seder, Robert A.; Darrah, Patricia A.; Roederer, Mario+NATURE REVIEWS IMMUNOLOGY+APR 2008::Understanding GPU Programming for Statistical Computation: Studies in Massively Parallel Massive Mixtures+Suchard, Marc A.; Wang, Quanli; Chan, Cliburn; et al.+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+JUN 2010::no title+West, M; Harrison, J.+Bayesian Forecasting and Dynamic Models+1997::Inference in successive sampling discovery models+West, M+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+NOV 1996::no title+WEST M+STAT DECISION THEORY+1994"

Model Selection and Adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo for Bayesian Cointegrated VAR Models.,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/10-BA518,2010,32,5,"This paper develops a matrix-variate adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology for Bayesian Cointegrated Vector Auto Regressions (CVAR). We replace the popular approach to sampling Bayesian CVAR models, involving griddy Gibbs, with an automated efficient alternative, based on the Adaptive Metropolis algorithm of Roberts and Rosenthal (2009). Developing the adaptive MCMC framework for Bayesian CVAR models allows for efficient estimation of posterior parameters in significantly higher dimensional CVAR series than previously possible with existing griddy Gibbs samplers. For a n-dimensional CVAR series, the matrix-variate posterior is in dimension 3n(2) + n, with significant correlation present between the blocks of matrix random variables. Hence, utilizing a griddy Gibbs sampler for large n becomes computationally impractical as it involves approximating an n x n full conditional posterior using a spline over a high dimensional n x n grid. The adaptive MCMC approach is demonstrated to be ideally suited to learning on-line a proposal to reflect the posterior correlation structure, therefore improving the computational efficiency of the sampler.

We also treat the rank of the CVAR model as a random variable and perform joint inference on the rank and model parameters. This is achieved with a Bayesian posterior distribution defined over both the rank and the CVAR model parameters, and inference is made via Bayes Factor analysis of rank.

Practically the adaptive sampler also aids in the development of automated Bayesian cointegration models for algorithmic trading systems considering instruments made up of several assets, such as currency baskets. Previously the literature on financial applications of CVAR trading models typically only considers pairs trading (n=2) due to the computational cost of the griddy Gibbs. We are able to extend under our adaptive framework to n>>2 and demonstrate an example with n = 10, resulting in a posterior distribution with parameters up to dimension 310. By also considering the rank as a random quantity we can ensure our resulting trading models are able to adjust to potentially time varying market conditions in a coherent statistical framework.","Cointegrated Vector Auto Regression,Adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo,Bayes Factor","ERROR-CORRECTION,MCMC,ALGORITHMS,POSTERIOR","Peters, Gareth W.@Univ New S Wales, Dept Math & Stat, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia::Kannan, Balakrishnan@Baronia Capital Pty Ltd, Crows Nest, NSW, Australia::Lasscock, Ben@Baronia Capital Pty Ltd, Crows Nest, NSW, Australia::Mellen, Chris@Baronia Capital Pty Ltd, Crows Nest, NSW, Australia","Peters, Gareth W.@University of New South Wales Sydney::Kannan, Balakrishnan@Unknow::Lasscock, Ben@Unknow::Mellen, Chris@Unknow","Peters, Gareth@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2768-8979","no title+ANDRIEU C+ELECTR COMMUN+2007::On the ergodicity properties of some adaptive MCMC algorithms+Andrieu, Christophe; Moulines, Eric+ANNALS OF APPLIED PROBABILITY+AUG 2006::On adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms+Atchade, YF; Rosenthal, JS+BERNOULLI+OCT 2005::Identification restrictions and posterior densities in cointegrated Gaussian VAR systems+Bauwens, L; Lubrano, M+ADVANCES IN ECONOMETRICS+1996::A Gibbs sampling approach to cointegration+Bauwens, L; Giot, P+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS+1998::Marginal likelihood from the Gibbs output+Chib, Siddhartha.+Journal of the American Statistical Association+1995::COINTEGRATION AND ERROR CORRECTION - REPRESENTATION, ESTIMATION, AND TESTING+ENGLE, RF; GRANGER, CWJ+ECONOMETRICA+MAR 1987::Automating and evaluating reversible jump MCMC proposal distributions+Fan, Y.; Peters, G.

Sensitivity analysis and model selection for a generalized convolution model for spatial processes,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/10-BA519,2010,23,0,"We examine a flexible class of nonstationary stochastic models for multivariate spatial data proposed by Majumdar et al. (2010). This covariance model is based on convolutions of spatially varying covariance kernels with centers corresponding to the centers of ""local stationarity"". A Bayesian method for estimation of the parameters in the model based on a Gibbs sampler is applied to simulated data to check for model sensitivity. The effect of a perturbation of the model in terms of kernel centers is also examined. Finally, the method is applied to a bivariate soil chemistry data from the the Central Arizona Phoenix Long Term Ecological Project (CAP LTER). Prediction bias, prediction standard deviation and predictive coverage are examined for different candidate models. In addition, a comparison with the bivariate stationary coregionalization model introduced by Wackernagel (2003) is carried out. A variant of the model proposed in Majumdar et al. (2010), with random kernel centers, is also examined. The latter model is seen to work much better than the stationary coregionalization model, and to perform comparably with the model with random kernel centers. Simulations indicate that the model is sensitive to under- or over-specification of kernel centers. On the other hand, application to real data seems to indicate that centroids of the regions that are homogeneous can be used as means of the random kernel centers. Cross validation can be used as a way of finding the best model with an appropriate number of kernels.","convolution,multivariate spatial data,nonstationary covariance,posterior inference,model robustness","COVARIANCE FUNCTIONS,GRASSLAND SOILS,CARBON,NITROGEN,ECOSYSTEMS,TEXTURE,CLIMATE,URBAN","Majumdar, Anandamayee@Arizona State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA::Paul, Debashis@Univ Calif Davis, Dept Stat, Davis, CA 95616 USA::Kaye, Jason@Penn State Univ, Dept Crop Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Majumdar, Anandamayee@Arizona State University::Paul, Debashis@University of California Davis@University of California System::Kaye, Jason@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University",not exist,"no title+Breiman, L; Friedman, J; Stone, CJ<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Olshen, RA</span>.+Classification and regression trees+1984::TEXTURE, CLIMATE, AND CULTIVATION EFFECTS ON SOIL ORGANIC-MATTER CONTENT IN US GRASSLAND SOILS+BURKE, IC; YONKER, CM; PARTON, WJ; et al.+SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL+MAY-JUN 1989::no title+CARLIN BP+J STAT SOFTW+2007::Latent variable analysis of multivariate spatial data+Christensen, WF; Amemiya, Y+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2002::Spectral methods for nonstationary spatial processes+Fuentes, M+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 2002::Modeling and predicting complex space-time structures and patterns of coastal wind fields+Fuentes, M; Chen, L; Davis, JM; et al.+ENVIRONMETRICS+AUG 2005::A new class of nonstationary spatial models+Fuentes, M; Smith, RL.+Tech. rep+2001::Nonstationary multivariate process modeling through spatially varying coregionalization+Gelfand, AE; Schmidt, AM; Banerjee, S; et al.+TEST+DEC 2004::Space and Space-Time Modeling Using Process Convolutions+Higdon, D.+Quantitative Methods for Current Environmental Issues+2002::Non-Stationary Spatial Modeling+Higdon, D.

Gibbs samplers are derived for all cases. This is the first work to discuss regularized quantile regression with the group lasso penalty and the elastic net penalty.

Predicting Vertical Connectivity Within an Aquifer System,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/10-BA522,2010,15,4,"The subsurface environment beneath the Municipality of Bologna, Italy, is comprised of a series of alluvial deposits which constitute large and productive aquifer systems. These are separated from the shallow, free surface aquifer by a low permeability barrier called aquitard Alpha. The upper aquifer contains water that shows relevant contamination from industrial pollutants. The deep aquifers are relatively pristine and provide about 80% of all groundwater used for drinking and industrial purposes in the area of Bologna. Hence, it is imperative that planners understand where along aquitard Alpha there exists potential direct connection between the upper and the deep aquifers, which could lead to contamination of the city's key water supply well fields.

In order to better assess the existence of preferential flow paths between these aquifer systems, we carry out a statistical analysis in which the aquitard is represented as a bivariate spatial process, accounting for dependence between the two spatial components. The first process models its effective thickness. The second process is binary, modeling the presence or absence of direct vertical connections between the aquifers. This map is then cross referenced with other forms of data regarding the hydrology of the region.","Markov chain Monte Carlo,Gaussian process,subjective likelihood,spatial model",,"Short, Margaret@Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Dept Stat, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA::Higdon, Dave@Los Alamos Natl Lab, Stat Sci Grp, Los Alamos, NM USA::Guadagnini, Laura@Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Ingn Idraul Mbientale Infrastrutture, I-20133 Milan, Italy::Guadagnini, Alberto@Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Ingn Idraul Mbientale Infrastrutture, I-20133 Milan, Italy::Tartakovsky, Daniel M.@Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, San Diego, CA 92103 USA","Short, Margaret@University of Alaska Fairbanks@University of Alaska System::Higdon, Dave@Los Alamos National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)::Guadagnini, Laura@Polytechnic University of Milan::Guadagnini, Alberto@Polytechnic University of Milan::Tartakovsky, Daniel M.@University of California San Diego@University of California System","Tartakovsky, Daniel@E-7694-2013","no title+Agresti,, A.+Categorical data analysis+1990::Large-scale architecture of a thrust-related alluvial complex from subsurface data: the quaternary succession of the Po Basin in the bologna area (northern Italy)+Amorosi, A.; Farina, M.+Glom.

In order to make such analysis operational, we propose a new sampling algorithm based upon Evolutionary Monte Carlo and designed to work under the ""large p, small n"" paradigm, thus making fully Bayesian multivariate analysis feasible, for example, in genetics/genomics experiments. Two real data examples in genomics are presented, demonstrating the performance of the algorithm in a space of up to 10, 000 covariates. Finally the methodology is compared with a recently proposed search algorithms in an extensive simulation study.","Evolutionary Monte Carlo,Fast Scan Metropolis-Hastings scheme,linear Gaussian regression models,variable selection","VARIABLE SELECTION,MONTE-CARLO,REGRESSION,GENOME","Bottolo, Leonard@Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, MRC Clin Sci Ctr, London, England@Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Biostat, London, England::Richardson, Sylvia@Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Biostat, London, England","Bottolo, Leonard@Imperial College London::Richardson, Sylvia@Imperial College London","Richardson, Sylvia@G-4691-2015","A haplotype map of the human genome+Altshuler, D; Brooks, LD; Chakravarti, A; et al.+NATURE+OCT 27 2005::A systems biology approach to understanding elevated serum alanine transaminase levels in a clinical trial with ximelagatran+Andersson, Ulf; Lindberg, Johan; Wang, Shunghuang; et al.+BIOMARKERS+2009::Gene selection using a two-level hierarchical Bayesian model+Bae, K; Mallick, BK+BIOINFORMATICS+DEC 12 2004::Multivariate Bayesian variable selection and prediction+Brown, PJ; Vannucci, M; Fearn, T+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1998::no title+CALVO F+J CHEM PHYS+2005::Bayesian variable selection with related predictors+Chipman, H+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+MAR 1996::The practical implementation of Bayesian model selection (with discussion)+Chipman, H.; George, E.

Galaxy Formation: a Bayesian Uncertainty Analysis,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/10-BA524,2010,36,56,"In many scientific disciplines complex computer models are used to understand the behaviour of large scale physical systems. An uncertainty analysis of such a computer model known as Galform is presented. Galform models the creation an devolution of approximately one million galaxies from the beginning of the Universe until the current day, an disregarded as a state-of-the-art model within the cosmology community. It requires the specification of many input parameters in order to run the simulation, takes significant time to run, and provides various outputs that can be compared with real world data. A Bayes Linear approach is presented in order to identify the subset of the input space that could give rise to acceptable matches between model output and measured data. This approach takes account of the major sources of uncertainty in a consistent and unified manner, including input parameter uncertainty, function uncertainty, observational error, forcing function uncertainty and structural uncertainty. The approach is known as History Matching, and involves the use of an iterative succession of emulators (stochastic belief specifications detailing beliefs about the Galform function), which are used to cut down the input parameter space. The analysis was successful inproducing a large collection of model evaluations that exhibit good fits to the observed data.","computer models,uncertainty analysis,model discrepancy,history matching,Bayes linear analysis,galaxy formation,galform","REDSHIFT SURVEY,DETERMINISTIC FUNCTIONS,COMPUTER,CALIBRATION,PREDICTION,INFERENCE,MODEL,EMULATION,OUTPUTS,SYSTEMS","Vernon, Ian@Univ Durham, Sci Labs, Dept Math Sci, Durham DH1 3LE, England::Goldstein, Michael@Univ Durham, Sci Labs, Dept Math Sci, Durham DH1 3LE, England::Bower, Richard G.@Univ Durham, Sci Labs, Dept Phys, Durham DH1 3LE, England","Vernon, Ian@Durham University::Goldstein, Michael@Durham University::Bower, Richard G.@Durham University",not exist,"no title+BASTOS TS+TECHNOMETRICS+2008::A primer on hierarchical galaxy formation: the semi-analytical approach+Baugh, C.

Particle Learning for General Mixtures,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/10-BA525,2010,54,15,"This paper develops particle learning (PL) methods for the estimation of general mixture models. The approach is distinguished from alternative particle filtering methods in two major ways. First, each iteration begins by resampling particles according to posterior predictive probability, leading to a more efficient set for propagation. Second, each particle tracks only the ""essential state vector"" thus leading to reduced dimensional inference. In addition, we describe how the approach will apply to more general mixture models of current interest in the literature; it is hoped that this will inspire a greater number of researchers to adopt sequential Monte Carlo methods for fitting their sophisticated mixture based models. Finally, we show that PL leads to straight forward tools for marginal likelihood calculation and posterior cluster allocation.","Nonparametric,mixture models,particle filtering,Dirichlet process,Indian buffet process,probit stick-breaking","DIRICHLET PROCESS MIXTURE,NONPARAMETRIC BAYESIAN-INFERENCE,MARGINAL LIKELIHOOD,SAMPLING METHODS,UNKNOWN NUMBER,MODELS,DISTRIBUTIONS,COMPONENTS,OUTPUT","Carvalho, Carlos M.@Univ Texas Austin, McCombs Sch Business, Austin, TX 78712 USA::Lopes, Hedibert F.@Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL USA::Polson, Nicholas G.@Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL USA::Taddy, Matt A.@Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL USA","Carvalho, Carlos M.@University of Texas Austin@University of Texas System::Lopes, Hedibert F.@Unknow::Polson, Nicholas G.@Unknow::Taddy, Matt A.@Unknow","Lopes, Hedibert@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8429-0353","MIXTURES OF DIRICHLET PROCESSES WITH APPLICATIONS TO BAYESIAN NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS+ANTONIAK, CE+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1974::Marginal likelihood and Bayes factors for Dirichlet process mixture models+Basu, S; Chib, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2003::FERGUSON DISTRIBUTIONS VIA POLYA URN SCHEMES+BLACKWELL, D; MACQUEEN, JB+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1973::Variational Inference for Dirichlet Process Mixtures+Blei, David M.; Jordan, Michael I.+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2006::A semiparametric Bayesian model for randomised block designs+Bush, CA; MacEachern, SN+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1996::Particle Learning and Smoothing+Carvalho, Carlos M.; Johannes, Michael S.; Lopes, Hedibert F.; et al.+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+FEB 2010::Marginal likelihood from the Metropolis-Hastings output+Chib, S; Jeliazkov, I+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2001::Marginal likelihood from the Gibbs output+Chib, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1995::A sequential particle filter method for static models+Chopin, N+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 2002::no title+DELMORAL P+MONTE CARLO+2006::Kernel stick-breaking processes+Dunson, David B.; Park, Ju-Hyun+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 2008::BAYESIAN DENSITY-ESTIMATION AND INFERENCE USING MIXTURES+ESCOBAR, MD; WEST, M+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1995::no title+FEARNHEAD P+J COMPUTATIONAL GRAP+2007::Particle filters for mixture models with an unknown number of components+Fearnhead, P+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+JAN 2004::Bayesian density estimation by mixtures of normal distributions+Ferguson, T.

A Bayesian Edgeworth expansion by Stein's Identity,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/10-BA526,2010,29,7,The Edgeworth expansion is a series that approximates a probability distribution in terms of its cumulants. One can derive it by first expanding the probability distribution in Hermite orthogonal functions and then collecting terms in powers of the sample size. This paper derives an expansion for posterior distributions which possesses these features of an Edgeworth series. The techniques used are a version of Stein's Identity and properties of Hermite polynomials. Two examples are provided to illustrate the accuracy of our series.,"Edgeworth expansion,Hermite polynomials,Laplace method,marginal posterior distribution,Stein's identity","SEQUENTIALLY DESIGNED EXPERIMENTS,POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTIONS,INTEGRABLE EXPANSIONS,EXPONENTIAL-FAMILIES,APPROXIMATIONS,NORMALITY","Weng, Ruby C.@Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Stat, Taipei 11623, Taiwan","Weng, Ruby C.@National Chengchi University",not exist,"A DECOMPOSITION FOR THE LIKELIHOOD RATIO STATISTIC AND THE BARTLETT CORRECTION - A BAYESIAN ARGUMENT+BICKEL, PJ; GHOSH, JK+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+SEP 1990::Expansions for nearly Gaussian distributions+Blinnikov, S; Moessner, R+ASTRONOMY &amp; ASTROPHYSICS SUPPLEMENT SERIES+MAY 1998::no title+Boas,, M.

Objective Bayesian Estimation for the Number of Species,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/10-BA527,2010,51,9,"Objective priors have been used in Bayesian models for estimating the number of species in a population, but they have not been examined in depth. Here we derive the form of two objective priors, using Bernardo's reference method and Jerreys' rule, based on the mixed-Poisson likelihood used in the single-abundance-sample species problem. These derivations are based on asymptotic results for estimates of integer-valued parameters. The factored form of these priors justifies the use of independent prior distributions for the parameter of interest (the number of species) and the nuisance parameters (of the stochastic abundance distribution). We find that the reference prior is preferable overall to the prior resulting from Jerreys' rule. Although a comprehensive objective Bayesian approach can be come analytically intractable for more complicated models, the essence of the approach can be upheld in practice. We analyze several datasets to show that the method can be implemented in practice and that it yields good results, comparable with current competing methods.","Jerreys' prior,mixed-Poisson,noninformative prior,reference prior,species richness estimation","CAPTURE-RECAPTURE DATA,POPULATION-SIZE,NONINFORMATIVE PRIORS,INFERENCE,MODEL,POISSON,SAMPLE,RICHNESS,PROBABILITY,PARAMETERS","Barger, Kathryn@Cornell Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA::Bunge, John@Cornell Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Barger, Kathryn@Cornell University::Bunge, John@Cornell University",not exist,"Bayesian Estimation of the Number of Species using Noninformative Priors+Barger, Kathryn; Bunge, John+BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL+DEC 2008::Microeukaryote community patterns along an O-2/H2S gradient in a supersulfidic anoxic Fjord (Framvaren, Norway)+Behnke, A; Bunge, J; Barger, K; et al.+APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY+MAY 2006::no title+BERGER J+REFERENCE PRIORS DIS+2008::no title+Bernardo, J.

Posterior Simulation via the Signed Root Log-Likelihood Ratio,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/10-BA528,2010,24,5,"We explore the use of importance sampling based on signed root log-likelihood ratios for Bayesian computation. Approximations based on signed root log-likelihood ratios are used in two distinct ways; firstly, to define an importance function and, secondly, to define suitable control variates for variance reduction. These considerations give rise to alternative simulation-consistent schemes to MCMC for Bayesian computation in moderately parameterized regular problems. The schemes based on control variates can also be viewed as usefully supplementing computations based on asymptotic approximations by supplying external estimates of error. The methods are illustrated by agenetic linkage model and a censored regression model.","Bayesian computation,Control variates,Importance sampling,Signed rootlog-likelihood ratio,Variance reduction","MARGINAL TAIL PROBABILITIES,CONDITIONAL INFERENCE,DATA AUGMENTATION,CENSORED-DATA,APPROXIMATIONS,STATISTICS,MODELS","Kharroubi, S.

Spatial Mixture Modelling for Unobserved Point Processes: Examples in Immunofluorescence Histology,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/09-BA411,2009,14,19,"We discuss Bayesian modelling and computational methods in analysis of indirectly observed spatial point processes. The context involves noisy measurements on an underlying point process that provide indirect and noisy data on locations of point outcomes. We are interested in problems in which the spatial intensity function may be highly heterogenous, and so is modelled via flexible nonparametric Bayesian mixture models. Analysis aims to estimate the underlying intensity function and the abundance of realized but unobserved points. Our motivating applications involve immunological studies of multiple fluorescent intensity images in sections of lymphatic tissue where the point processes represent geographical configurations of cells. We are interested in estimating intensity functions and cell abundance for each of a series of such data sets to facilitate comparisons of outcomes at different times and with respect to differing experimental conditions. The analysis is heavily computational, utilizing recently introduced MCMC approaches for spatial point process mixtures and extending them to the broader new context here of unobserved outcomes. Further, our example applications are problems in which the individual objects of interest are not simply points, but rather small groups of pixels; this implies a need to work at an aggregate pixel region level and we develop the resulting novel methodology for this. Two examples with with immunofluorescence histology data demonstrate the models and computational methodology.","Bayesian computation,blocked Gibbs sampler,Dirichlet process mixture model,inhomogeneous Poisson process,unobserved point process",PRIORS,"Ji, Chunlin@Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC 27706 USA::Merl, Daniel@Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC 27706 USA::Kepler, Thomas B.@Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Immunol, Durham, NC USA::West, Mike@Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC 27706 USA","Ji, Chunlin@Duke University::Merl, Daniel@Duke University::Kepler, Thomas B.@Duke University::West, Mike@Duke University","Kepler, Thomas@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1383-6865","no title+Daley, D.

"Hierarchical Model Building, Fitting, and Checking: A Behind-the-Scenes Look at a Bayesian Analysis of Arsenic Exposure Pathways",BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/09-BA401,2009,25,12,"In this article, we present a behind-the-scenes look at a Bayesian hierarchical analysis of pathways of exposure to arsenic (a toxic heavy metal) using the Phase I National Human Exposure Assessment Survey carried out in Arizona. Our analysis combines individual-level personal exposure measurements (biomarker and environmental media) with water, soil, and air observations from the ambient environment. We include details of our model-building exercise that involved a combination of exploratory data analysis and substantive knowledge in exposure science. Then we present our strategies for model fitting, which involved piecing together components of the hierarchical model in a systematic fashion to assess issues including parameter identificability, Bayesian learning, model fit, and convergence diagnostics. We also discuss practical issues of data management and algorithm debugging, especially in the light of missing and censored data. We believe that our presentation of these behind-the-scenes details will be of use to other researchers who build complex Bayesian hierarchical models.","Arizona,Bayesian learning,data management,environmental health,Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm,model validation,National Human Exposure Assessment Survey (NHEXAS)","EPA REGION-5,DISTRIBUTIONS,NHEXAS,ARIZONA","Craigmile, Peter F.@Ohio State Univ, Dept Stat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA::Calder, Catherine A.@Ohio State Univ, Dept Stat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA::Li, Hongfei@IBM TJ Watson Res Ctr, Yorktown Hts, NY USA::Paul, Rajib@Western Michigan Univ, Dept Stat, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA::Cressie, Noel@Ohio State Univ, Dept Stat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Craigmile, Peter F.@Ohio State University::Calder, Catherine A.@Ohio State University::Li, Hongfei@International Business Machines (IBM)::Paul, Rajib@Western Michigan University::Cressie, Noel@Ohio State University","Cressie, Noel@B-8858-2009@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0274-8050::Calder, Catherine@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4459-1418","no title+Banerjee, S.; Carlin, B.

Parameter Estimation in Continuous Time Markov Switching Models: A Semi-Continuous Markov Chain Monte Carlo Approach,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/09-BA402,2009,23,7,"We want to estimate the parameters governing a continuous time Markov switching model given observations at discrete times only. For parameter estimation in a setting with continuous time and a latent state process, using MCMC methods two approaches are common: Using time-discretization and augmenting the unknowns with the (then discrete) state process, or working in continuous time and augmenting with the full state process. In this paper, we combine useful aspects of both approaches. On the one hand, we are inspired by the discretization, where filtering for the state process is possible, on the other hand, we catch attractive features of the continuous time method, like exact estimation (i.e. no discretization error) and direct estimation of the generator matrix rather than the transition matrix. This is achieved by taking not the whole state process for data augmentation but only the states at observation times. Using results on the distribution of occupation times in Markov processes, it is possible to compute the complete data likelihood exactly. We obtain a sampler that works more robustly and more accurately especially for fast switching in the state process.","Bayesian inference,data augmentation,hidden Markov model,switching diffusion","VOLATILITY ESTIMATION,DRIFT","Hahn, Markus@Austrian Acad Sci, RICAM, Linz, Austria::Sass, Joern@Univ Kaiserslautern, Dept Math, Kaiserslautern, Germany","Hahn, Markus@Austrian Academy of Sciences::Sass, Joern@University of Kaiserslautern",not exist,"no title+BALL FG+P ROYAL SOC A+1999::no title+Bremaud, P.+Point Processes and Queues: Martingale Dynamics+1981::American options with regime switching+Buffington, J.; Elliott, R.J.+International Journal of Theoretical and Applied Finance+2002::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::Hidden Markov Models+ELLIOTT, R.

Several Bayesian variable selection methods have been developed, and we concentrate on the following methods: Kuo & Mallick, Gibbs Variable Selection (GVS), Stochastic Search Variable Selection (SSVS), adaptive shrinkage with Jeffreys' prior or a Laplacian prior, and reversible jump MCMC. We review these methods, in the context of their different properties. We then implement the methods in BUGS, using both real and simulated data as examples, and investigate how the different methods perform in practice. Our results suggest that SSVS, reversible jump MCMC and adaptive shrinkage methods can all work well, but the choice of which method is better will depend on the priors that are used, and also on how they are implemented.","Variable Selection,MCMC,BUGS","QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI,MONTE-CARLO METHODS,QUALITATIVE TRAITS,MODEL SELECTION,ENTIRE GENOME,ASSOCIATION,LASSO,INFORMATION,PREDICTION,FRAMEWORK","O'Hara, R.

"Modularization in Bayesian Analysis, with Emphasis on Analysis of Computer Models",BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/09-BA404,2009,32,43,"Bayesian analysis incorporates different sources of information into a single analysis throough Bayes theorem. When one or more of the sources of information are suspect (e.g., if the model assumed for the information is viewed as quite possible being significantly flawed), there can be a concern that Bayes theorem allows this suspect information to overly influence the other sources of information. We consider a variety of situations in which this arises, and give methodological suggestions for dealing with the problem.

After consideration of some pedagogical examples of the phenomenon, we focus on the interface of statistics and the development of complex computer models of processes. Three testbed computer models are considered, in which this type of issue arises.","Complex computer models,Confounding,Emulators,Identifiability,MCMC mixing,Partial likelihood,Random effects","PARTIAL LIKELIHOOD,PREDICTION,CALIBRATION,VALIDATION,DESIGN","Liu, F.@Univ Missouri, Dept Stat, Columbia, MO 65211 USA::Bayarri, M.

A Bayesian Approach to Estimating the Long Memory Parameter,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/09-BA406,2009,51,11,"We develop a Bayesian procedure for analyzing stationary long-range dependent processes. Specifically, we consider the fractional exponential model (FEXP) to estimate the memory parameter of a stationary long-memory Gaussian time series. In particular, we propose a hierarchical Bayesian model and make it fully adaptive by imposing a prior distribution on the model order. Further, we describe a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for variable dimension estimation and show that, in our context, the algorithm provides a reasonable method of model selection (within each repetition of the chain). Therefore, through an application of Bayesian model averaging, we incorporate all possible models from the FEXP class (up to a given finite order). As a result we reduce the underestimation of uncertainty at the model-selection stage as well as achieve better estimates of the long memory parameter. Additionally, we establish Bayesian consistence of the memory parameter under mild conditions on the data process. Finally, through simulation and the analysis of two data sets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","Bayesian model averaging,FEXP,hierarchical Bayes,long-range dependence,reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo,Spectral density","BAND SEMIPARAMETRIC ESTIMATION,FRACTIONAL EXPONENTIAL MODELS,GAUSSIAN TIME-SERIES,RANGE DEPENDENCE,SPECTRAL DENSITY,LIKELIHOOD,REGRESSION,ALGORITHM,SELECTION,TESTS","Holan, Scott@Univ Missouri, Dept Stat, Columbia, MO 65211 USA::McElroy, Tucker@US Bur Census, Div Stat Res, Washington, DC 20233 USA::Chakraborty, Sounak@Univ Missouri, Dept Stat, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Holan, Scott@University of Missouri Columbia@University of Missouri System::McElroy, Tucker@Unknow::Chakraborty, Sounak@University of Missouri Columbia@University of Missouri System",not exist,"FITTING LONG-MEMORY MODELS BY GENERALIZED LINEAR-REGRESSION+BERAN, J+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1993::no title+Beran, J.+Statistics for long-memory processes+1994::A note on calculating autocovariances of long-memory processes+Bertelli, S; Caporin, M+JOURNAL OF TIME SERIES ANALYSIS+SEP 2002::EXPONENTIAL MODEL FOR SPECTRUM OF A SCALAR TIME SERIES+BLOOMFIELD, P+BIOMETRIKA+1973::no title+BOTCHER A+INTRO LARGE TRUNCATE+1999::They don't care+Breithaupt, H+EMBO REPORTS+JAN 2001::On the correlation matrix of the discrete Fourier transform and the fast solution of large Toeplitz systems for long-memory time series+Chen, Willa W.; Hurvich, Clifford M.; Lu, Yi+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2006::ON MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION OF THE DIFFERENCING PARAMETER OF FRACTIONALLY-INTEGRATED NOISE WITH UNKNOWN MEAN+CHEUNG, YW; DIEBOLD, FX+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUN 1994::UNDERSTANDING THE METROPOLIS-HASTINGS ALGORITHM+CHIB, S; GREENBERG, E+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+NOV 1995::Marginal likelihood from the Metropolis-Hastings output+Chib, S; Jeliazkov, I+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2001::EFFICIENT PARAMETER-ESTIMATION FOR SELF-SIMILAR PROCESSES+DAHLHAUS, R+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1989::TESTS FOR HURST EFFECT+DAVIES, RB; HARTE, DS+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1987::no title+Denison, D.; Holmes, C.; Mallick, B.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Smith, A</span>.+Bayesian Methods for Nonlinear Classification and Regression+2002::A Bayesian CART algorithm+Denison, DGT; Mallick, BK; Smith, AFM+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1998::LARGE-SAMPLE PROPERTIES OF PARAMETER ESTIMATES FOR STRONGLY DEPENDENT STATIONARY GAUSSIAN TIME-SERIES+FOX, R; TAQQU, MS+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 1986::no title+Gamerman, D.; Lopes, H.

Bayesian Generalized Method of Moments,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/09-BA407,2009,33,16,"We propose the Bayesian generalized method of moments (GMM), which is particularly useful when likelihood-based methods are difficult. By deriving the moments and concatenating them together, we buildup a weighted quadratic objective function in the GMM framework. As in a normal density function, we take the negative GMM quadratic function divided by two and exponentiate it to substitute for the usual likelihood. After specifying the prior distributions, we apply the Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure to sample from the posterior distribution. We carry out simulation studies to examine the proposed Bayesian GMM procedure, and illustrate it with a real data example.","Bayesian inference,Correlated data,Estimation efficiency,Generalized estimating equation,Generalized linear model,Gibbs sampling,Posterior distribution","QUASI-LIKELIHOOD FUNCTIONS,LONGITUDINAL DATA-ANALYSIS,LINEAR-MODELS,SAMPLE PROPERTIES,ESTIMATORS,RESTRICTIONS,DISCRETE","Yin, Guosheng@Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Biostat, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Yin, Guosheng@UTMD Anderson Cancer Center@University of Texas System",not exist,"no title+Bickel,, P.

Some Bayesian Credibility Premiums Obtained by Using Posterior Regret Gamma-Minimax Methodology,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/09-BA408,2009,29,4,"In credibility theory, the premium charged to a policy holder is computed on the basis of his/her own past claims and the accumulated past claims of the corresponding portfolio of policyholders. In order to obtain an appropriate formula for this, various methodologies have been proposed in actuarial literature, most of them in the field of Bayesian decision methodology.

In this paper, following the robust Bayesian paradigm, a procedure based on the posterior regret Gamma-minimax principle is applied to derive, in a straightforward way, new credibility formula, making use of simple classes of distributions. This methodology is applied to the most commonly used premium calculation principles in insurance, namely the net, Esscher and variance principles.","Classes of distributions,Credibility,Minimax,Premium,Posterior regret,Robustness","SENSITIVITY,MOMENTS,RANGES,PRIORS","Gomez-Deniz, E.@Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Dept Quantitat Methods, Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Spain","Gomez-Deniz, E.@Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria",not exist,"no title+BAILEY AL+P CASUALTY ACTUARIAL+1945::An overview of robust Bayesian analysis+Berger, J.

Modal Clustering in a Class of Product Partition Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/09-BA409,2009,35,22,"This paper defines a class of univariate product partition models for which a novel deterministic search algorithm is guaranteed to find the maximum a posteriori (MAP) clustering or the maximum likelihood (ML) clustering. While the number of possible clusterings of n items grows exponentially according to the Bell number, the proposed mode-finding algorithm exploits properties of the model to provide a search requiring only n(n+1) computations. No Monte Carlo is involved. Thus, the algorithm finds the MAP or ML clustering for potentially tens of thousands of items, where as it can only be approximated through a stochastic search. Integrating over the model parameters in a Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) model leads to a product partition model. A simulation study explores the quality of the clustering estimates despite departures from the assumptions. Finally, applications to three specific models - clustering means, probabilities, and variances - are used to illustrate the variety of applicable models and mode-finding algorithm.","Bayesian nonparametrics,Dirichlet process mixture model,model-based clustering,maximum a posteriori clustering,maximum likelihood clustering,product partition models","BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS,GENE-EXPRESSION,SOFTWARE,CRITERIA,NUMBER","Dahl, David B.@Texas A&M Univ, Dept Stat, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Dahl, David B.@Texas A&M University System@Texas A&M University College Station",not exist,"PRODUCT PARTITION MODELS FOR CHANGE POINT PROBLEMS+BARRY, D; HARTIGAN, JA+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+MAR 1992::Exponential numbers+Bell, E.

A grade of membership model for rank data,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/09-BA410,2009,55,12,"A grade of membership (GoM) model is an individual level mixture model which allows individuals have partial membership of the groups that characterize a population. A GoM model for rank data is developed to model the particular case when the response data is ranked in nature. A Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampler provides the framework for model fitting, but the intricate nature of the rank data models makes the selection of suitable proposal distributions difficult. 'Surrogate' proposal distributions are constructed using ideas from optimization transfer algorithms. Model fitting issues such as label switching and model selection are also addressed.

The GoM model for rank data is illustrated through an analysis of Irish election data where voters rank some or all of the candidates in order of preference. Interest lies in highlighting distinct groups of voters with similar preferences (i.e. 'voting blocs') within the electorate, taking into account the rank nature of the response data, and in examining individuals' voting bloc memberships. The GoM model for rank data is fitted to data from an opinion poll conducted during the Irish presidential election campaign in 1997.","Grade of membership models,Plackett-Luce model,surrogate proposal distributions,rank data,voting blocs","MIXTURE-MODELS,DISTRIBUTIONS","Gormley, Isobel Claire@Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Math Sci, Dublin, Ireland::Murphy, Thomas Brendan@Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Math Sci, Dublin, Ireland","Gormley, Isobel Claire@University College Dublin::Murphy, Thomas Brendan@University College Dublin","Gormley, Isobel Claire@F-7089-2016::Murphy, Thomas Brendan@H-4366-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5668-7046","LOGISTIC-NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS - SOME PROPERTIES AND USES+AITCHISON, J; SHEN, SM+BIOMETRIKA+1980::no title+Aitchison, J.+The Statistical Analysis of Compositional Data+1986::no title+Bartholomew, DJ; Knott, M.+Latent variable models and factor analysis+1999::Computer-based horse race handicapping and wagering systems: a report+Benter, W.+Efficiency of Racetrack Betting Markets+1994::Latent Dirichlet allocation+Blei, DM; Ng, AY; Jordan, MI+JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH+MAY 15 2003::RANK ANALYSIS OF INCOMPLETE BLOCK DESIGNS .1.

ABC likelihood-free methods for model choice in Gibbs random fields,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/09-BA412,2009,23,40,"Gibbs random fields (GRF) are polymorphous statistical models that can be used to analyse different types of dependence, in particular for spatially correlated data. However, when those models are faced with the challenge of selecting a dependence structure from many, the use of standard model choice methods is hampered by the unavailability of the normalising constant in the Gibbs likelihood. In particular, from a Bayesian perspective, the computation of the posterior probabilities of the models under competition requires special likelihood-free simulation techniques like the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) algorithm that is intensively used in population genetics. We show in this paper how to implement an ABC algorithm geared towards model choice in the general setting of Gibbs random fields, demonstrating in particular that there exists a sufficient statistic across models. The accuracy of the approximation to the posterior probabilities can be further improved by importance sampling on the distribution of the models. The practical aspects of the method are detailed through two applications, the test of an iid Bernoulli model versus a first-order Markov chain, and the choice of a folding structure for two proteins.","Approximate Bayesian Computation,model choice,Gibbs Random Fields,Bayes factor,protein folding","CHAIN MONTE-CARLO,NORMALIZING CONSTANTS,MARKOV","Grelaud, Aude@Univ Paris 09, CEREMADE, MIG, INRA Jouy En Josas, F-75775 Paris 16, France::Robert, Christian P.@Unknow::Marin, Jean-Michel@Univ Montpellier 2, Inst Math & Modelisat Montpellier, F-34095 Montpellier 5, France::Rodolphe, Francois@Unknow::Taly, Jean-Francois@Unknow","Grelaud, Aude@PSL Research University Paris (ComUE)@Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA)@Universite Paris-Dauphine::Robert, Christian P.@Unknow::Marin, Jean-Michel@Languedoc-Roussillon Universites (ComUE)@Universite de Montpellier::Rodolphe, Francois@Unknow::Taly, Jean-Francois@Unknow","Marin, Jean-Michel@C-7658-2016@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7451-9719","Approximate Bayesian computation in population genetics+Beaumont, MA; Zhang, WY; Balding, DJ+GENETICS+DEC 2002::SPATIAL INTERACTION AND STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS OF LATTICE SYSTEMS+BESAG, J+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1974::STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS OF NON-LATTICE DATA+BESAG, J+STATISTICIAN+1975::Non-linear regression models for Approximate Bayesian Computation+Blum, Michael G.

"Inference in incidence, infection, and impact: Co-infection of multiple hosts by multiple pathogens",BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/09-BA413,2009,44,7,"A large literature concerns the epidemiology of single pathogens on single hosts. Yet in some environmental applications,such as fungal pathogens of forest tree seedlings,the ""one host-one pathogen"" paradigm may not be applicable. Multiple potential pathogens are often found in a single individual and/or multiple hosts share the same pathogens. Understanding diversity requires techniques to infer how multiple pathogens might regulate multiple hosts and to predict how imp acts might vary with the environment. Here we present a hierarchical framework for the case where there is detection information based on multiple sources(cultures, gene sequencing,and survival observations),and the inference problem includes not only parameters that describe environmental influences on pathogen incidence infection, and host survival, but also on latent states themselves-pathogen incidence at a site and infection statuses of hosts. Due to the large size of the model space, we develop a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo approach to select models, estimate posterior distributions, and predict environmental influences on host survival. we demonstrate with application to a data set involving fungal pathogens on tree hosts,where data include host survival and fungal detection using cultures and DNA sequencing.","DNA sequence data,forest dynamics,Janzen Connell hypothesis,reversible jump MCMC,species diversity,variable selection","DENSITY-DEPENDENT MORTALITY,FOLIAR FUNGAL ENDOPHYTES,TROPICAL TREE,MODEL DETERMINATION,DISPERSAL DISTANCE,SEEDLING MORTALITY,SPECIES-DIVERSITY,PLANT DIVERSITY,FORESTS,COEXISTENCE","Clark, James S.@Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA::Hersh, Michelle H.@Duke Univ, Univ Program Ecol, Dept Biol, Durham, NC USA","Clark, James S.@Duke University::Hersh, Michelle H.@Duke University","Hersh, Michelle@D-2079-2009::Clark, James@G-6331-2011::Hersh, Michelle@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1174-7575","no title+Agrios, G.

Improved Criteria for Clustering Based on the Posterior Similarity Matrix,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/09-BA414,2009,37,36,"In this paper we address the problem of obtaining a single clustering estimate (c) over cap based on an MCMC sample of clusterings c((1)),c((2))..., c((M)) from the posterior distribution of a Bayesian cluster model. Methods to derive (c) over cap when the number of groups K varies between the clusterings are reviewed and discussed. These include the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate and methods based on the posterior similarity matrix, a matrix containing the posterior probabilities that the observations i and j are in the same cluster. The posterior similarity matrix is related to a commonly used loss function by Binder (1978). Minimization of the loss is shown to be equivalent to maximizing the Randindex between estimated and true clustering. We propose new criteria for estimating a clustering, which are based on the posterior expected adjusted Rand index. The criteria are shown to possess a shrink age property and out perform Binder's loss in a simulation study and in an application to gene expression data.

A Dynamic Modelling Strategy for Bayesian Computer Model Emulation,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/09-BA415,2009,34,35,"Computer model evaluation studies build statistical models of deterministic stimulation-based predictions of field data to then assess and criticize the computer model and suggest refinements. Computer models are often expensive computationally: statistical models that adequately emulate their key features can be very much more efficient. Gaussian process models are often used as emulators, but the resulting computation slack the ability to scale to higher-dimensional, time-dependent or functional outputs. For some such problems, especially for contexts of time series outputs, building emulators using dynamic linear models provides a computationally attractive alternative as well as a flexible modelling approach capable of emulating a broad range of stochastic structures underlying the input-output simulations. We describe this here, combining Bayesian multivariate dynamic linear models with Gaussian process modeliing in an effective manner, and illustrate the approach with data from a hydrological simulation model. The general strategy will be useful for other computer model evaluation studies with time series or functional outputs.","Computer model emulation,Dynamic linear model,Forwarding filtering,backward sampling,Gaussian process,Markov chain Monte Carlo,Time-Varying Autoregression","CALIBRATION,PREDICTION,VALIDATION,SYSTEMS,DESIGN,OUTPUT","Liu, Fei@Univ Missouri, Dept Stat, Columbia, MO 65211 USA::West, Mike@Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC USA","Liu, Fei@University of Missouri Columbia@University of Missouri System::West, Mike@Duke University",not exist,"Bayesian inference on latent structure in time series+Aguilar, O.; Prado, R.; Huerta, G.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; West, M</span>.+Bayesian statistics+1999::no title+BAYARRI M+BAYESIAN VALIDATION+2005::Computer model validation with functional output+Bayarri, M.

A method is proposed that allows some covariates to affect some response variables and not others, and that clusters responses which have similar dependence on the same set of covariates. A Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure is employed to sample from the space of pairwise partitions of covariates and outcomes, where a pair consists of a subset of all outcomes and their associated covariates.

Bayesian Analysis for Emerging Infectious Diseases,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/09-BA417,2009,32,39,"Infectious diseases both within human and animal populations often pose serious health and socioeconomic risks. From a statistical perspective, their prediction is complicated by the fact that no two epidemics are identical due to changing contact habits, mutations of infectious agents, and changing human and animal behaviour in response to the presence of an epidemic. Thus model parameters governing infectious mechanisms will typically be unknown. On the other hand, epidemic control strategies need to be decided rapidly as data accumulate. In this paper we present a fully Bayesian methodology for performing inference and online prediction for epidemics in structured populations. Key features of our approach are the development of an MCMC- (and adaptive MCMC-) based methodology for parameter estimation, epidemic prediction, and online assessment of risk from currently unobserved infections. We illustrate our methods using two complementary studies: an analysis of the 2001 UK Foot and Mouth epidemic, and modelling the potential risk from a possible future Avian Influenza epidemic to the UK Poultry industry.",,"MOUTH EPIDEMIC,STOCHASTIC EPIDEMICS,GREAT-BRITAIN,H5N1 VIRUS,FOOT,TRANSMISSION,ERGODICITY,LIKELIHOOD,ALGORITHMS,INFERENCE","Jewell, Chris P.@Univ Lancaster, Dept Math & Stat, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England::Kypraios, Theodore@Univ Nottingham, Sch Math Sci, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England::Neal, Peter@Univ Manchester, Sch Math, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England::Roberts, Gareth O.@Univ Warwick, Dept Stat, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England","Jewell, Chris P.@Lancaster University::Kypraios, Theodore@University of Nottingham::Neal, Peter@University of Manchester::Roberts, Gareth O.@University of Warwick","Kypraios, Theodore@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6190-4762","The pathogenesis and diagnosis of foot-and-mouth disease+Alexandersen, S; Zhang, Z; Donaldson, AI; et al.+JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PATHOLOGY+JUL 2003::Stochastic Epidemic Models and Their Statistical Analysis+Andersson, H.; Britton, T.+LECT NOTES STAT+2000::On the ergodicity properties of some adaptive MCMC algorithms+Andrieu, Christophe; Moulines, Eric+ANNALS OF APPLIED PROBABILITY+AUG 2006::no title+Bailey, N T J.+The Mathematical Theory of Infectious Diseases+1975::no title+Becker, NG.+Analysis of infectious disease data+1989::Statistical studies of infectious disease incidence+Becker, NG; Britton, T+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1999::Likelihood-based estimation of continuous-time epidemic models from time-series data: application to measles transmission in London+Cauchemez, Simon; Ferguson, Neil M.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE+AUG 6 2008::Human influenza A H5N1 virus related to a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus+Claas, ECJ; Osterhaus, ADME; van Beek, R; et al.+LANCET+FEB 14 1998::OpenMP: An industry standard API for shared-memory programming+Dagum, L; Menon, R+IEEE COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE &amp; ENGINEERING+JAN-MAR 1998::no title+DEARDON R+INFERENCE INDI UNPUB+2007::no title+*DEFR+DEFR WEBS+2007::no title+*DEFR+EGGS POULTR FACTS ST+2007::Spatio-temporal point processes, partial likelihood, foot and mouth disease+Diggle, Peter J.+STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH+2006::no title+*EUR CTR DIS SURV+EURO SURVEILL+2006::Transmission intensity and impact of control policies on the foot and mouth epidemic in Great Britain+Ferguson, NM; Donnelly, CA; Anderson, RM+NATURE+OCT 4 2001::The foot-and-mouth epidemic in Great Britain: Pattern of spread and impact of interventions+Ferguson, NM; Donnelly, CA; Anderson, RM+SCIENCE+MAY 11 2001::no title+GIBSON GJ+APPL STAT-J ROY ST C+1997::Estimating parameters in stochastic compartmental models using Markov chain methods+Gibson, GJ; Renshaw, E+IMA JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS APPLIED IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY+MAR 1998::An adaptive Metropolis algorithm+Haario, H; Saksman, E; Tamminen, J+BERNOULLI+APR 2001::Dynamics of the 2001 UK foot and mouth epidemic: Stochastic dispersal in a heterogeneous landscape+Keeling, MJ; Woolhouse, MEJ; Shaw, DJ; et al.+SCIENCE+OCT 26 2001::no title+Kypraios, T.+Efficient Bayesian inference for partially observed stochastic epidemics and a new class of semi-parametric time series models+2007::Statistical inference in a stochastic epidemic SEIR model with control intervention: Ebola as a case study+Lekone, Phenyo E.; Finkenstadt, Barbel F.+BIOMETRICS+DEC 2006::A case study in non-centering for data augmentation: Stochastic epidemics+Neal, P; Roberts, G+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+OCT 2005::Bayesian inference for partially observed stochastic epidemics+O'Neill, PD; Roberts, GO+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1999::no title+PAPASPILIOPOULO.O+THESIS LANCASTER U L+2003::Non-centred parametrisations for hierarchical models and data augmentation+Papaspiliopoulos, O.; Roberts, G.O.; Skold, M.+BAYESIAN STAT+2003::Coupling and ergodicity of adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms+Roberts, Gareth O.; Rosenthal, Jeffrey S.+JOURNAL OF APPLIED PROBABILITY+JUN 2007::Topographic determinants of foot and mouth disease transmission in the UK 2001 epidemic+Savill, N.J.; Shaw, D.J.; Deardon, R.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Tildesley, M.J.; Keeling, M.J.; Brooks, S.P.; Woolhouse, M.E.J.; Grenfell, B.T</span>.+BMC Vet.

Flexible Univariate Continuous Distributions,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/09-BA418,2009,13,4,"Based on a constructive representation, which distinguishes between a skewing mechanism P and an underlying symmetric distribution F, we introduce two flexible classes of distributions. They are generated by nonparametric modelling of either P or F. We examine properties of these distributions and consider how they can help us to identify which aspects of the data are badly captured by simple symmetric distributions. Within a Bayesian framework, we investigate useful prior settings and conduct inference through MCMC methods. On the basis of simulated and real data examples, we make recommendations for the use of our models in practice. Our models perform well in the context of density estimation using the multimodal galaxy data and for regression modelling with data on the body mass index of athletes.","density estimation,location-scale,modal regression,moment existence,skewness,unimodality","BAYESIAN DENSITY-ESTIMATION,T-DISTRIBUTION,MIXTURES,MODE","Quintana, Fernando A.@Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Estadist, Santiago, Chile::Steel, Mark F.

Prediction of Pregnancy: A Joint Model for Longitudinal and Binary Data,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/09-BA419,2009,25,17,"We consider the problem of predicting the achievement of successful pregnancy, in a population of women undergoing treatment for infertility, based on longitudinal measurements of adhesiveness of certain blood lymphocytes. A goal of the analysis is to provide, for each woman, an estimated probability of becoming pregnant. We discuss various existing approaches, including multiple t-tests, mixed models, discriminant analysis and two-stage models. We use a joint model developed by Wang et al. (2000), consisting of a linear mixed effects model for the longitudinal data and a generalized linear model (glm) for the primary end point, (here a binary indicator of successful pregnancy). The joint longitudinal/glm model is analogous to the popular joint models for longitudinal and survival data.

Efficient Utility-based Clustering over High Dimensional Partition Spaces,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/09-BA420,2009,29,4,"Because of the huge number of partitions of even a moderately sized dataset, even when Bayes factors have a closed form, in model-based clustering a comprehensive search for the highest scoring (MAP) partition is usually impossible. However, when each cluster in a partition has a signature and it is known that some signatures are of scientific interest whilst others are not, it is possible, within a Bayesian framework, to develop search algorithms which are guided by these cluster signatures. Such algorithms can be expected to find better partitions more quickly. In this paper we develop a framework within which these ideas can be formalized. We then briefly illustrate the efficacy of the proposed guided search on a microarray time coursed at a set where the clustering objective is to identify clusters of genes with different types of circadian expression profiles.",,"GENE-EXPRESSION DATA,MODEL,PATTERNS","Liverani, Silvia@Univ Warwick, Dept Stat, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England::Anderson, Paul E.@Univ Warwick, Dept Stat, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England::Edwards, Kieron D.@Adv Technol Ltd, Cambridge, England::Millar, Andrew J.@Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Syst Biol Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland::Smith, Jim Q.@Univ Warwick, Dept Stat, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England","Liverani, Silvia@University of Warwick::Anderson, Paul E.@University of Warwick::Edwards, Kieron D.@Unknow::Millar, Andrew J.@University of Edinburgh::Smith, Jim Q.@University of Warwick","Millar, Andrew@G-2423-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1756-3654::Liverani, Silvia@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1870-3017::Edwards, Kieron@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7202-4082","no title+ANDERSON PE+GUIDED CONJUGATE BAY+2006::MODEL-BASED GAUSSIAN AND NON-GAUSSIAN CLUSTERING+BANFIELD, JD; RAFTERY, AE+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1993::Clustering gene expression patterns+Ben-Dor, A; Shamir, R; Yakhini, Z+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY+FAL-WIN 1999::no title+Bernardo, J.

Bayesian Inference for Directional Conditionally Autoregressive Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/09-BA425,2009,37,0,"Counts or averages over arbitrary regions are often analyzed using conditionally autoregressive (CAR) models. The neighborhoods within CAR models are generally determined using only the inter-distances or boundaries between the sub-regions. To accommodate spatial variations that may depend on directions, a new class of models is developed using different weights given to neighbors in different directions. By accounting for such spatial anisotropy, the proposed model generalizes the usual CAR model that assigns equal weight to all directions. Within a fully hierarchical Bayesian framework, the posterior distributions of the parameters are derived using conjugate and non-informative priors. Efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithms are provided to generate samples from the marginal posterior distribution of the parameters. Simulation studies are presented to evaluate the performance of the estimators and are used to compare results with traditional CAR models. Finally the method is illustrated using data sets on local crime frequencies in Columbus, OH and on the elevated blood lead levels of children under the age of 72 months observed in Virginia counties for the year of 2000.","Anisotropy,Bayesian estimation,Conditionally autoregressive models,Lattice data,Spatial analysis","SPATIAL INTERACTION,COVARIANCE,SYSTEMS","Kyung, Minjung@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA::Ghosh, Sujit K.@N Carolina State Univ, Dept Stat, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Kyung, Minjung@State University System of Florida@University of Florida::Ghosh, Sujit K.@North Carolina State University@University of North Carolina",not exist,"no title+Anselin,, L.+Spatial econometrics: methods and models+1988::On conditional and intrinsic autoregressions+Besag, J; Kooperberg, C+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1995::SPATIAL INTERACTION AND STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS OF LATTICE SYSTEMS+BESAG, J+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1974::STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS OF NON-LATTICE DATA+BESAG, J+STATISTICIAN+1975::APPROXIMATE INFERENCE IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS+BRESLOW, NE; CLAYTON, DG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::ON DISTINCTION BETWEEN CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY + JOINT PROBABILITY APPROACHES IN SPECIFICATION OF NEAREST-NEIGHBOUR SYSTEMS+BROOK, D+BIOMETRIKA+1964::EMPIRICAL BAYES ESTIMATES OF AGE-STANDARDIZED RELATIVE RISKS FOR USE IN DISEASE MAPPING+CLAYTON, D; KALDOR, J+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1987::no title+Cliff, A.

Spiked Dirichlet Process Prior for Bayesian Multiple Hypothesis Testing in Random Effects Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/09-BA426,2009,41,13,"We propose a Bayesian method for multiple hypothesis testing in random effects models that uses Dirichlet process (DP) priors for a nonparametric treatment of the random effects distribution. We consider a general model formulation which accommodates a variety of multiple treatment conditions. A key feature of our method is the use of a product of spiked distributions, i.e. , mixtures of a point-mass and continuous distributions, as the centering distribution for the DP prior. Adopting these spiked centering priors readily accommodates sharp null hypotheses and allows for the estimation of the posterior probabilities of such hypotheses. Dirichlet process mixture models naturally borrow information across objects through model-based clustering while inference on single hypotheses averages over clustering uncertainty. We demonstrate via a simulation study that our method yields increased sensitivity in multiple hypothesis testing and produces a lower proportion of false discoveries than other competitive methods. While our modeling framework is general, here we present an application in the context of gene expression from microarray experiments. In our application, the modeling framework allows simultaneous inference on the parameters governing differential expression and inference on the clustering of genes. We use experimental data on the transcriptional response to oxidative stress in mouse heart muscle and compare the results from our procedure with existing nonparametric Bayesian methods that provide only a ranking of the genes by their evidence for differential expression.","Bayesian nonparametrics,differential gene expression,Dirichlet process prior,DNA microarray,mixture priors,model-based clustering,multiple hypothesis testing","FALSE DISCOVERY RATE,DIFFERENTIAL GENE-EXPRESSION,MICROARRAY EXPERIMENTS,MIXTURE MODEL,VARIABLE SELECTION,UNIFIED APPROACH,INFERENCE,RATES,EXPLORATION","Kim, Sinae@Univ Michigan, Dept Biostat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA::Dahl, David B.@Texas A&M Univ, Dept Stat, College Stn, TX 77843 USA::Vannucci, Marina@Rice Univ, Dept Stat, Houston, TX 77251 USA","Kim, Sinae@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan::Dahl, David B.@Texas A&M University System@Texas A&M University College Station::Vannucci, Marina@Rice University",not exist,"MIXTURES OF DIRICHLET PROCESSES WITH APPLICATIONS TO BAYESIAN NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS+ANTONIAK, CE+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1974::A Bayesian framework for the analysis of microarray expression data: regularized t-test and statistical inferences of gene changes+Baldi, P;

Modeling space-time data using stochastic differential equations,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/09-BA427,2009,25,8,"This paper demonstrates the use and value of stochastic differential equations for modeling space-time data in two common settings. The first consists of point-referenced or geostatistical data where observations are collected at fixed locations and times. The second considers random point pattern data where the emergence of locations and times is random. For both cases, we employ stochastic differential equations to describe a latent process within a hierarchical model for the data. The intent is to view this latent process mechanistically and endow it with appropriate simple features and interpretable parameters. A motivating problem for the second setting is to model urban development through observed locations and times of new home construction; this gives rise to a space-time point pattern. We show that a spatio-temporal Cox process whose intensity is driven by a stochastic logistic equation is a viable mechanistic model that affords meaningful interpretation for the results of statistical inference. Other applications of stochastic logistic differential equations with space-time varying parameters include modeling population growth and product diffusion, which motivate our first, point-referenced data application. We propose a method to discretize both time and space in order to fit the model. We demonstrate the inference for the geostatistical model through a simulated dataset. Then, we fit the Cox process model to a real dataset taken from the greater Dallas metropolitan area.","geostatistical data,point pattern,hierarchical model,stochastic logistic equation,Markov chain Monte Carlo,urban development","GAUSSIAN COX PROCESSES,COVARIANCE FUNCTIONS,INFERENCE","Duan, Jason A.@Univ Texas Austin, Dept Mkt, McCombs Sch Business, Austin, TX 78712 USA::Gelfand, Alan E.@Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC USA::Sirmans, C.

Sample Size Calculation for Finding Unseen Species,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/09-BA429,2009,18,7,"Estimation of the number of species extant in a geographic region has been discussed in the statistical literature for more than sixty years. The focus of this work is on the use of pilot data to design future studies in this context. A Dirichlet-multinomial probability model for species frequency data is used to obtain a posterior distribution on the number of species and to learn about the distribution of species frequencies. A geometric distribution is proposed as the prior distribution for the number of species. Simulations demonstrate that this prior distribution can handle a wide range of species frequency distributions including the problematic case with many rare species and a few exceptionally abundant species. Monte Carlo methods are used along with the Dirichlet-multinomial model to perform sample size calculations from pilot data, e. g. , to determine the number of additional samples required to collect a certain proportion of all the species with a pre-specified cover age probability.

Markov Switching Dirichlet Process Mixture Regression,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/09-BA430,2009,32,7,"Markov switching models can be used to study heterogeneous populations that are observed over time. This paper explores modeling the group characteristics nonparametrically, under both homogeneous and nonhomogeneous Markov switching for group probabilities. The model formulation involves a finite mixture of conditionally independent Dirichlet process mixtures, with a Markov chain defining the mixing distribution. The proposed methodology focuses on settings where the number of subpopulations is small and can be assumed to be known,and flexible modeling is required for group regressions. We develop Dirichlet process mixture prior probability models for the joint distribution of individual group responses and covariates. The implied conditional distribution of the response given the covariates is then used for inference. The modeling framework allows for both non-linearities in the resulting regression functions and non-standard shapes in the response distributions. We design a simulation-based model fitting method for full posterior inference. Furthermore, we propose a general approach for inclusion of external covariates dependent on the Markov chain but conditionally independent from the response. The methodology is applied to a problem from fisheries research involving analysis of stock-recruitment data under shifts in the ecosystem state.","Dirichlet process prior,hidden Markov model,Markov chain Monte Carlo,multivariate normal mixture,stock-recruitment relationship","STOCK-RECRUITMENT RELATIONSHIPS,NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS,BAYESIAN-ESTIMATION,SAMPLING METHODS,MODELS,DISTRIBUTIONS,PACIFIC,PRIORS","Taddy, Matthew A.@Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA::Kottas, Athanasios@Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Appl Math & Stat, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Taddy, Matthew A.@University of Chicago::Kottas, Athanasios@University of California Santa Cruz@University of California System",not exist,"MIXTURES OF DIRICHLET PROCESSES WITH APPLICATIONS TO BAYESIAN NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS+ANTONIAK, CE+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1974::no title+BERLINER LM+WAT RESOURCES RES+1999::Bayesian estimation of switching ARMA models+Billio, M; Monfort, A; Robert, CP+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+DEC 1999::FERGUSON DISTRIBUTIONS VIA POLYA URN SCHEMES+BLACKWELL, D; MACQUEEN, JB+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1973::Calculating posterior distributions and modal estimates in Markov mixture models+Chib, S+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+NOV 1996::CONCEPTS OF INDEPENDENCE FOR PROPORTIONS WITH A GENERALIZATION OF DIRICHLET DISTRIBUTION+CONNOR, RJ; MOSIMANN, JE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1969::BAYESIAN ANALYSIS OF SOME NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS+FERGUSON, TS+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1973::no title+Fruhwirth-Schnatter, S.+Finite mixture and markov switching models+2006::A computational approach for full nonparametric Bayesian inference under Dirichlet process mixture models+Gelfand, AE; Kottas, A+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+JUN 2002::A Markov Model for Switching Regressions+Goldfeld, S.

A Case for Robust Bayesian Priors with Applications to Clinical Trials,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/09-BA431,2009,20,17,"Bayesian analysis is frequently confused with conjugate Bayesian analysis. This is particularly the case in the analysis of clinical trial data. Even though conjugate analysis is perceived to be simpler computationally (but see below, Berger's prior), the price to be paid is high: such analysis is not robust with respect to the prior, i.e. changing the prior may affect the conclusions without bound. Furthermore, conjugate Bayesian analysis is blind with respect to the potential conflict between the prior and the data. Robust priors, however, have bounded influence. The prior is discounted automatically when there are conflicts between prior information and data. In otherwords, conjugate priors may lead to a dogmatic analysis while robust priors promote self-criticism since prior and sample information are not on equal footing. The original proposal of robust priors was made by de-Finetti in the 1960's. However, the practice has not taken hold in important areas where the Bayesian approach is making definite advances such as in clinical trials where conjugate priors are ubiquitous.

We show here how the Bayesian analysis for simple binary binomial data, expressed in its exponential family form, is improved by employing Cauchy priors. This requires no undue computational cost, given the advances in computation and analytical approximations. Moreover, we introduce in the analysis of clinical trials a robust prior originally developed by J.O. Berger that we call Berger's prior. We implement specific choices of prior hyperparameters that give closed-form results when coupled with a normal log-odds likelihood. Berger's prior yields a robust analysis with no added computational complication compared to the conjugate analysis. We illustrate the results with famous textbook examples and also with a real data set and a prior obtained from a previous trial. On the formal side, we present a general and novel theorem, the ""Polynomial Tails Comparison Theorem."" This theorem establishes the analytical behavior of any likelihood function with tails bounded by a polynomial when used with priors with polynomial tails, such as Cauchy or Student's t. The advantages of the theorem are that the likelihood does not have to be a location family nor exponential family distribution and that the conditions are easily verifiable. The binomial likelihood can be handled as a direct corollary of the result. Next, we proceed to prove a striking result:the intrinsic prior to test a normal mean, obtained as an objective prior for hypothesis testing, is a limit of Berger's robust prior. This result is useful for assessments and for MCMC computations. We then generalize the theorem to prove that Berger's prior and intrinsic priors are robust with normal likelihoods. Finally, we apply the results to a large clinical trial that took place in Venezuela, using prior information based on a previous clinical trial conducted in Finland.

Our main conclusion is that introducing the existing prior information in the form of a robust prior is more justifiable simultaneously for federal agencies, researchers, and other constituents because the prior information is coherently discarded when in conflict with the sample information.","Berger's Prior,Clinical Trials,Exponential Family,Intrinsic Prior,Parametric Robust Priors,Polynomial Tails Comparison Theorem,Robust Priors","EXPONENTIAL FAMILY,POSTERIOR MOMENTS,APPROXIMATIONS,EXPECTATIONS,PARAMETER,INFERENCE","Fuquene, Jairo A.@Univ Puerto Rico, Inst Stat, Sch Business Adm, San Juan, PR 00936 USA::Cook, John D.@Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Div Quantitat Sci, Houston, TX 77030 USA::Pericchi, Luis R.@Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Math, San Juan, PR 00936 USA","Fuquene, Jairo A.@University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez@University of Puerto Rico::Cook, John D.@UTMD Anderson Cancer Center@University of Texas System::Pericchi, Luis R.@University of Puerto Rico",not exist,"no title+ABRAMOWITZ M+HDB MATH FUNCTIONS N+1970::no title+Berger, J.+Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis+1985::What explains the difference between the futures' price and its ""fair"" value?

Bayesian Variable Selection and Computation for Generalized Linear Models with Conjugate Priors,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/08-BA323,2008,45,16,"In this paper, we consider theoretical and computational connections between six popular methods for variable subset selection in generalized linear models (GLM's). Under the conjugate priors developed by Chen and Ibrahim (2003) for the generalized linear model, we obtain closed form analytic relationships between the Bayes factor (posterior model probability), the Conditional Predictive Ordinate (CPO), the L measure, the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC), the Aikiake Information Criterion (AIC), and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) in the case of the linear model. Moreover, we examine computational relationships in the model space for these Bayesian methods for an arbitrary GLM under conjugate priors as well as examine the performance of the conjugate priors of Chen and Ibrahim (2003) in Bayesian variable selection. Specifically, we show that once Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples are obtained from the full model, the four Bayesian criteria can be simultaneously computed for all possible subset models in the model space. We illustrate our new methodology with a simulation study and a real dataset.","Bayes factor,Conditional Predictive Ordinate,Conjugate prior,L measure,Poisson regression,Logistic regression",,"Chen, Ming-Hui@Univ Connecticut, Dept Stat, Storrs, CT 06269 USA::Huang, Lan@NCI, SRAB, Rockville, MD USA::Ibrahim, Joseph G.@Univ N Carolina, Dept Biostat, Chapel Hill, NC USA::Kim, Sungduk@NICHHD, Div Epidemiol Stat & Prevent Res, Rockville, MD USA","Chen, Ming-Hui@University of Connecticut::Huang, Lan@National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA@NIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)::Ibrahim, Joseph G.@University of North Carolina Chapel Hill@University of North Carolina::Kim, Sungduk@National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA@NIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)",not exist,"Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principal+Akaike, H.+INT S INF THEOR+1973::Bayes model averaging with selection of regressors+Brown, PJ; Vannucci, M; Fearn, T+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2002::Multivariate Bayesian variable selection and prediction+Brown, PJ; Vannucci, M; Fearn, T+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1998::ON ASYMPTOTIC NORMALITY OF LIMITING DENSITY-FUNCTIONS WITH BAYESIAN IMPLICATIONS+CHEN, CF+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1985::no title+Chen, M.-H.; Shao, Q.

Inferring Climate System Properties Using a Computer Model,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/08-BA301,2008,42,35,"A method is presented to estimate the probability distributions of climate system properties based on a hierarchical Bayesian model. At the base of the model, we use simulations of a climate model in which the outputs depend on the climate system properties and can also be compared with observations. The degree to which the model outputs are\consistent ""with the observations is used to obtain the likelihood for the climate system properties. We define the climate system properties as those properties of the climate model that control the large-scale response of the climate system to external forcings. In this paper, we use the MIT 2D climate model (MIT2DCM) to provide simulations of ocean, surface and upper atmospheric temperature behavior over zones defined by latitude bands. In the MIT2DCM, the climate system properties can be set via three parameters: Climate sensitivity (the equilibrium surface temperature change in response to a doubling of CO2 concentrations), the rate of deep-ocean heat uptake (as set by the diffusion of temperature anomalies in to the deep-ocean below the climatological mixed layer), and net strength of the anthropogenic aerosol forcings. In this work, we use output from MIT2DCM coupled with historical temperature records to make inference about these climate system properties. Even though the MIT2DCM is far less computationally demanding than a full 3D climate model, the task of running the model for each combination of the climate parameters and processing its output is computationally demanding. Thus, a statistical model is required to approximate the model output. We obtain results that are critical for understanding uncertainty in future climate change and provide an independent check that the information contained in recent climate change is robust to statistical treatment.","model calibration,climate change,climate sensitivity,Bayesian methods",,"Sanso, Bruno@Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Appl Math & Stat, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA::Forest, Chris E.@MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, Boston, MA USA::Zantedeschi, Daniel@Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Appl Math & Stat, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Sanso, Bruno@University of California Santa Cruz@University of California System::Forest, Chris E.@Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)::Zantedeschi, Daniel@University of California Santa Cruz@University of California System","Forest, Chris@M-1993-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2643-0186","Objective estimation of the probability density function for climate sensitivity+Andronova, NG; Schlesinger, ME+JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES+OCT 16 2001::no title+[Anonymous].+Climate Change 2007: the Physical Science Basis.

Dynamic and Structural Features of Intifada Violence: A Markov Process Approach,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/08-BA302,2008,16,2,"This paper analyzes the daily incidence of violence during the Second Intifada. We compare several alternative statistical models with different dynamic and structural stability characteristics while keeping modelling complexity to a minimum by only maintaining the assumption that the process under consideration is at most a second order discrete Markov process. For the pooled data, the best model is one with asymmetric dynamics, where one Israeli and two Palestinian lags determine the conditional probability of violence. However, when we allow for structural change, the evidence strongly favors the hypothesis of structural instability across political regime sub-periods, within which dynamics are generally weak.","Bayesian,conjugate prior,Israeli-Palestinian conflict,marginal likelihood",,"Jeliazkov, Ivan@Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92717 USA::Poirier, Dale J.@Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92717 USA","Jeliazkov, Ivan@University of California Irvine@University of California System::Poirier, Dale J.@University of California Irvine@University of California System","Jeliazkov, Ivan@C-3108-2009@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4924-9910","Bayesian forecasting of multinomial time series through conditionally Gaussian dynamic models+Cargnoni, C; Muller, P; West, M+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1997::SIMULTANEOUS ESTIMATION OF MULTINOMIAL CELL PROBABILITIES+FIENBERG, SE; HOLLAND, PW+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1973::no title+Gelman, A.; Carlin, J.

How many clusters?,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/08-BA304,2008,35,31,"The title poses a deceptively simple question that must be addressed by any statistical model or computational algorithm for the clustering of points. Two distinct interpretations are possible, one connected with the number of clusters in the sample and one with the number in the population. Under suitable conditions, these questions may have essentially the same answer, but it is logically possible for one answer to be finite and the other infinite. This paper reformulates the standard Dirichlet allocation model as a cluster process in such a way that these and related questions can be addressed directly. Our conclusion is that the data are sometimes informative for clustering points in the sample, but they seldom contain much information about parameters such as the number of clusters in the population.","Cluster process,Dirichlet partition,Gauss-Ewens process,Random sub-clusters,Species-counting model",,"McCullagh, Peter@Univ Chicago, Dept Stat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA::Yang, Jie@Univ Illinois, Dept Math Stat & Comp Sci, Chicago, IL 60680 USA","McCullagh, Peter@University of Chicago::Yang, Jie@University of Illinois Chicago Hospital@University of Illinois Chicago@University of Illinois System",not exist,"no title+ALDOUS DJ+ECOLE ETE PROBABILIT+1985::MIXTURES OF DIRICHLET PROCESSES WITH APPLICATIONS TO BAYESIAN NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS+ANTONIAK, CE+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1974::CORRECTION+ARMAND, JL+AIAA JOURNAL+1972::no title+Arratia, R.; Barbour, A.

An asymptotic viewpoint on high-dimensional Bayesian testing,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/08-BA305,2008,52,3,"The Bayesian point-null testing problem is studied asymptotically under a high-dimensional normal-means model. A noninformative prior structure is proposed for general problems, and then refined for the specialized contexts of goodness-of-fit testing and functional data analysis. The associated tests are demonstrated on existing data sets and shown to provide a cornerstone for a tool-box of detailed analysis tools. The conceptual approach is to allow the prior null probability to vary with dimension and with prior dispersion parameters, then to guide its parametrization so that the posterior null probability behaves in accordance with Bayesian asymptotic-consistency concepts. Among the theoretical issues studied are the objectivity of setting the prior null probability to one-half, the Jeffreys-Lindley paradox, and the influence of smoothness constraints.","Bayesian testing,high-dimensional testing,rates of testing,functional data analysis,goodness-of-fit testing",,"Spitzner, Dan J.@Univ Virginia, Dept Stat, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA","Spitzner, Dan J.@University of Virginia",not exist,"Optimal testing in a fixed-effects functional analysis of variance model+Abramovich, F; Antoniadis, A; Sapatinas, T<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Vidakovic, B</span>.+Int J Wavelets Multiresolut Inf Process.+2004::no title+Adams, R.

This note describes how Fisher divided responsibility for the error between Bayes and Laplace. Bayes he admired for formulating the problem, producing a solution and then withholding it; Laplace he blamed for promulgating the theory and for distorting the concept of probability to accommodate the theory. At the end of his life Fisher added a refinement: in the Essay Bayes had anticipated one of Fisher's own fiducial arguments.","Ronald Fisher,Thomas Bayes,Pierre-Simon Laplace,Dennis Lindley,Bayes' Theorem,Inverse probability",,"Aldrich, John@Univ Southampton, Sch Social Sci, Div Econ, Southampton, Hants, England","Aldrich, John@University of Southampton",not exist,"no title+ALDRICH J+HIST POLITI IN PRESS+2008::The statistical education of Harold Jeffreys+Aldrich, J+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+DEC 2005::Fisher's ""Inverse Probability"" of 1930+Aldrich, J+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+AUG 2000::R.

A Method for Avoiding Bias from Feature Selection with Application to Naive Bayes Classification Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/08-BA307,2008,10,2,"For many classification and regression problems, a large number of features are available for possible use - this is typical of DNA microarray data on gene expression, for example. Often, for computational or other reasons, only a small subset of these features are selected for use in a model, based on some simple measure such as correlation with the response variable. This procedure may introduce an optimistic bias, however, in which the response variable appears to be more predictable than it actually is, because the high correlation of the selected features with the response may be partly or wholly due to chance. We show how this bias can be avoided when using a Bayesian model for the joint distribution of features and response. The crucial insight is that even if we forget the exact values of the unselected features, we should retain, and condition on, the knowledge that their correlation with the response was too small for them to be selected. In this paper we describe how this idea can be implemented for ""naive Bayes"" models of binary data. Experiments with simulated data confirm that this method avoids bias due to feature selection. We also apply the naive Bayes model to subsets of data relating gene expression to colon cancer, and find that correcting for bias from feature selection does improve predictive performance.","feature selection,optimistic bias,naive Bayes models,gene expression data",,"Li, Longhai@Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Math & Stat, Saskatoon, SK, Canada::Zhang, Jianguo@Univ Toronto, Dept Stat, Toronto, ON, Canada::Neal, Radford M.@Univ Toronto, Dept Stat, Toronto, ON, Canada","Li, Longhai@University of Saskatchewan::Zhang, Jianguo@University of Toronto::Neal, Radford M.@University of Toronto",not exist,"Broad patterns of gene expression revealed by clustering analysis of tumor and normal colon tissues probed by oligonucleotide arrays+Alon, U; Barkai, N; Notterman, DA; et al.+PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA+JUN 8 1999::Selection bias in gene extraction on the basis of microarray gene-expression data+Ambroise, C; McLachlan, GJ+PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA+MAY 14 2002::no title+Bishop, C.

A Bayesian Structural Equations Model for Multilevel Data with Missing Responses and Missing Covariates,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/08-BA308,2008,37,7,"Motivated by a large multilevel survey conducted by the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA), we propose a structural equations model which involves a set of latent variables to capture dependence between different responses, a set of facility level random effects to capture facility heterogeneity and dependence between individuals within the same facility, and a set of covariates to account for individual heterogeneity. Identifiability associated with structural equations modeling is addressed and properties of the proposed model are carefully examined. An effective and practically useful modeling strategy is developed to deal with missing responses and to model missing covariates in the structural equations framework. Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is used to carry out Bayesian posterior computation. Several variations of the proposed model are considered and compared via the deviance information criterion.

Estimating radiocarbon calibration curves,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/08-BA309,2008,46,13,"In addition to being crucial to the establishment of archaeological chronologies, radiocarbon dating is vital to the establishment of times lines for many Holocene and late Pleistocene palaeoclimatic studies and palaeoenvironmental re-constructions. The calibration curves necessary to map radiocarbon to calendar ages were originally estimated using only measurements on known age tree-rings. More recently, however, the types of records available for calibration have diversified and a large group of scientists (known as the IntCal Working Group-IWG) with a wide range of backgrounds has come together to create internationally-agreed estimates of the calibration curves. In 2002, Caitlin Buck was recruited to the IWG and asked to offer advice on statistical methods for curve construction. In collabration with Paul Blackwell, she devised a tailor-made Bayesian curve estimation method which was adopted by the IWG for making all of the 2004 internationally-agreed radiocarbon calibration curve estimates. This paper reports on that work and on the on-going work that will eventually provide models, methods and software for rolling updates to the curve estimates.",,,"Blackwell, P.

Bayesian Sample Size Determination for Binomial Proportions,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/08-BA310,2008,22,18,"This paper presents several new results on Bayesian sample size determination for estimating binomial proportions, and provides a comprehensive comparative overview of the subject. We investigate the binomial sample size problem using generalized versions of the Average Length and Average Coverage Criteria, the Median Length and Median Coverage Criteria, as well as the Worst Outcome Criterion and its modified version. We compare sample sizes derived from highest posterior density and equal-tailed credible intervals. In some cases, we derive, for the first time, closed form sample size formulae, and where this is not possible, we describe various numerical approaches. These range in complexity from Monte Carlo simulations to more sophisticated curve fitting techniques, third order analystic approximations, and exact, but more computaionally-intensive, methods.

Directional Log-Spline Distributions,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/08-BA311,2008,38,4,"We introduce a new class of distributions to model directional data, based on hyperspherical log-splines. The class is very flexible and can be used to model data that exhibit features that cannot be accommodated by typical parametric distributions, such as asymmetries and multimodality. The distributions are defined on hyperspheres of any dimension and thus, include the most common circular and spherical cases. Due to the flexibility of hyperspherical log-splines, the distributions can closely approximate observed behaviour and are as smooth as desired. We propose a Bayesian setup for conducting inference with directional log-spline distributions where we pay particular attention to the prior specification and the matching of the priors of the log-splines model and an alternative model constructed through a mixture of von Mises distributions. We compare both models in the context of three data sets: simulated data on the circle, circular data on the movement of turtles and a spherical application to the arrival direction of cosmic rays.","Directional distributions,hyperspherical splines,mixture of distributions,prior matching,von Mises distributions",,"Ferreira, Jose T.

Semi-parametric Bayesian Inference for Multi-Season Baseball Data,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/08-BA312,2008,24,5,"We analyze complete sequences of successes (hits, walks, and sacrifices) for a group of players from the American and National Leagues, collected over 4 seasons. The goal is to describe how players' performance vary from season to season. In particular, we wish to assess and compare the effect of available occasion-specific covariates over seasons. The data are binary sequences for each player and each season. We model dependence in the binary sequence by an autoregressive logistic model. The model includes lagged terms up to a fixed order. For each player and season we introduce a different set of autologistic regression coefficients, i.e., the regression coefficients are random effects that are specific of each season and player. We use a nonparametric approach to define a random effects distribution. The nonparametric model is defined as a mixture with a Dirichlet process prior for the mixing measure. The described model is justified by a representation theorem for order-k exchangeable sequences. Besides the repeated measurements for each season and player, multiple seasons within a given player define an additional level of repeated measurements. We introduce dependence at this level of repeated measurements by relating the season-specific random effects vectors in an autoregressive fashion. We ultimately conclude that while some covariates like the ERA of the opposing pitcher are always relevant, others like an indicator for the game being into the seventh inning may be significant only for certain season, and some others, like the score of the game, can safely be ignored.","Dirichlet Process,Partial Exchangeability,Semiparametric Random Effects",,"Quintana, Fernando A.@Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Estadist, Santiago, Chile::Mueller, Peter@Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Biostat, Houston, TX 77030 USA::Rosner, Gary L.@Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Biostat, Houston, TX 77030 USA::Munsell, Mark@Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Biostat, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Quintana, Fernando A.@Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile::Mueller, Peter@UTMD Anderson Cancer Center@University of Texas System::Rosner, Gary L.@UTMD Anderson Cancer Center@University of Texas System::Munsell, Mark@UTMD Anderson Cancer Center@University of Texas System",not exist,"no title+ALBRIGHT SC+J AM STAT ASSOC+1993::MIXTURES OF DIRICHLET PROCESSES WITH APPLICATIONS TO BAYESIAN NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS+ANTONIAK, CE+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1974::Bayesian analysis of binary regression using symmetric and asymmetric links+Basu, S.; Mukhopadhyay, S.+Sankhya: The Indian Journal of Statistics, Series B+2000::A semiparametric Bayesian model for randomised block designs+Bush, CA; MacEachern, SN+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1996::no title+Carlin, B.

Bayesian Dynamic Density Estimation,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/08-BA313,2008,58,29,"Empirical distributions in finance and economics might show heavy tails, volatility clustering, varying mean returns and multimodality as part of their features. However, most statistical models available in the literature assume some kind of parametric form (clearly neglecting important characteristics of the data) or focus on modeling extreme events (therefore, providing no information about the rest of the distribution). In this paper we develop a Bayesian nonparametric prior for a collection of distributions evolving in discrete time. The prior is constructed by defining the distribution at any time point as a Dirichlet process mixture of Gaussian distributions, and inducing dependence through the atoms of their stick-breaking decomposition. A general construction, which allows for trends, periodicities and regressors is described. The resulting model is applied to the estimation of the time-varying travel expense distribution of employees from a major development bank comparable to the IDB, IMF and World Bank.","Dependent Dirichlet process,Nonparametric Bayes,Random probability measure,Travel Costs,Insurance Claim Distributions",,"Rodriguez, Abel@Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA::ter Horst, Enrique@Unknow","Rodriguez, Abel@University of California Santa Cruz@University of California System::ter Horst, Enrique@Unknow",not exist,"Bayesian inference on latent structure in time series+Aguilar, O.; Prado, R.; Huerta, G.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; West, M</span>.+Bayesian statistics+1999::MIXTURES OF DIRICHLET PROCESSES WITH APPLICATIONS TO BAYESIAN NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS+ANTONIAK, CE+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1974::no title+BIGELOW J+0518 DUK U I STAT DE+2005::FERGUSON DISTRIBUTIONS VIA POLYA URN SCHEMES+BLACKWELL, D; MACQUEEN, JB+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1973::no title+Box, G.; Jenkins, G.+Time Series Analysis Forecasting and Control+1974::A semiparametric Bayesian model for randomised block designs+Bush, CA; MacEachern, SN+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1996::no title+CARON F+IEEE T SIGN IN PRESS+2008::ON GIBBS SAMPLING FOR STATE-SPACE MODELS+CARTER, CK; KOHN, R+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1994::Alternative neural network approaches to corporate bond rating+Chaveesuk, R.; Srivaree-Ratana, C.; Smith, A.E.+Journal of Engineering Valuation and Cost Analysis+1999::Semiparametric Bayes analysis of longitudinal data treatment models+Chib, S; Hamilton, BH+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+SEP 2002::An ANOVA model for dependent random measures+De Iorio, M; Muller, P; Rosner, GL; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2004::no title+DUNSON D+J AM STAT ASS+2007::Bayesian dynamic modeling of latent trait distributions+Dunson, David B.+BIOSTATISTICS+OCT 2006::Bayesian density regression+Dunson, David B.; Pillai, Natesh; Park, Ju-Hyun+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2007::no title+DUNSON DB+BIOMETRIKA IN PRESS+2008::Bayesian semiparametric isotonic regression for count data+Dunson, DB+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2005::AUTOREGRESSIVE CONDITIONAL HETEROSCEDASTICITY WITH ESTIMATES OF THE VARIANCE OF UNITED-KINGDOM INFLATION+ENGLE, RF+ECONOMETRICA+1982::BAYESIAN DENSITY-ESTIMATION AND INFERENCE USING MIXTURES+ESCOBAR, MD; WEST, M+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1995::ESTIMATING NORMAL MEANS WITH A DIRICHLET PROCESS PRIOR+ESCOBAR, MD+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1994::no title+ESCOBAR MD+PRACTICAL NONPARAMET+1998::no title+FELLINGHAM G+DEP APPL MATH STAT T+2007::PRIOR DISTRIBUTIONS ON SPACES OF PROBABILITY MEASURES+FERGUSON, TS+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1974::BAYESIAN ANALYSIS OF SOME NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS+FERGUSON, TS+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1973::no title+FRUEHWIRTHSCHNA.S+J TIME SER ANAL+1994::Bayesian nonparametric spatial modeling with Dirichlet process mixing+Gelfand, AE; Kottas, A; MacEachern, SN+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2005::Modelling heterogeneity with and without the Dirichlet process+Green, PJ; Richardson, S+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+JUN 2001::no title+GRIFFIN J+NONPARAMETRIC UNPUB+2007::no title+GRIFFIN J+U KENT TECHNICAL REP+2007::Order-based dependent Dirichlet processes+Griffin, JE; Steel, MFJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2006::Semiparametric Bayesian inference in autoregressive panel data models+Hirano, K+ECONOMETRICA+MAR 2002::Credit rating analysis with support vector machines and neural networks: a market comparative study+Huang, Z; Chen, HC; Hsu, CJ; et al.+DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS+SEP 2004::Gibbs sampling methods for stick-breaking priors+Ishwaran, H; James, LF+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2001::Fitting Tweedie's compound poisson model to insurance claims data: dispersion modelling+Jorgensen, B.; Smyth, G.

Bayesian Nonparametrics for Heavy Tailed Distribution. Application to Food Risk Assessment,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/08-BA314,2008,43,4,"Based on the fact that any heavy tailed distribution can be approximated by a possibly infinite mixture of Pareto distributions, this paper proposes two Bayesian methodologies tailored to infer on distribution tails belonging to the Frechet domain of attraction. Firstly, a Bayesian Pareto based clustering procedure is developed, where the mixing distribution is chosen to be the classical conjugate prior of the Pareto distribution. This allows the grouping of n objects into a certain number of clusters according to their extremal behavior and also exhibits a new estimator for the tail index. Secondly, a nonparametric extension of the model based clustering is proposed in which the parameter of interest is the mixing distribution. Estimation of the tail probability is conducted using a Dirichlet process prior for the unknown mixing distribution. To illustrate, both methodologies are applied to simulated data sets and a real data set concerning dietary exposure to a mycotoxin called Ochratoxin A.","Dirichlet process,Model Based clustering,Ochratoxin A,Tail index estimation","DIRICHLET PROCESS PRIOR,OCHRATOXIN-A,EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT,MODELS,CHEMICALS,INFERENCE","Tressou, Jessica@INRA Met Risk, Food Risk Anal Methodol UR1204, F-75005 Paris, France@Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, ISMT, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Tressou, Jessica@Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA)@Hong Kong University of Science & Technology",not exist,"BAYESIAN-ESTIMATION AND PREDICTION FOR PARETO DATA+ARNOLD, BC; PRESS, SJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1989::Bayesian analysis for classical distributions using conditionally specified priors+Arnold, BC; Castillo, E; Sarabia, JM.+Sankhya B+1998::Estimation of the extreme-value index and generalized quantile plots+Beirlant, J; Dierckx, G; Guillou, A+BERNOULLI+DEC 2005::Tail index estimation and an exponential regression model+Beirlant, J.; Dierckx, G.; Goegebeur, Y.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Matthys, G</span>.+Extremes+1999::Incomplete generalized U-statistics for food risk assessment+Bertail, P; Tressou, J+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2006::A storage model with random release rate for modeling exposure to food contaminants+Bertail, Patrice; Clemencon, Stephan; Tressou, Jessica+MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES AND ENGINEERING+JAN 2008::FERGUSON DISTRIBUTIONS VIA POLYA URN SCHEMES+BLACKWELL, D; MACQUEEN, JB+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1973::Bayesian analysis of extreme values by mixture modeling+Bottolo, L.; Lijoi, A.; Consonni, G.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Dellaportas, P</span>.+Extremes+2003::BALKAN ENDEMIC NEPHROPATHY - STILL A MYSTERIOUS DISEASE+BOZIC, Z; DUANCIC, V; BELICZA, M; et al.+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+APR 1995::Bayesian methods in extreme value modelling: A review and new developments+Coles, SG; Powell, EA+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+APR 1996::Fitness-for-purpose of dietary survey duration: A case-study with the assessment of exposure to ochratoxin A+Counil, E; Verger, P; Volatier, JL+FOOD AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY+APR 2006::Handling of contamination variability in exposure assessment: A case study with ochratoxin A+Counil, E; Verger, P; Volatier, JL+FOOD AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY+OCT 2005::no title+*CREDOC AFSSA DGAL+ENQ INCA IND NAT CON+1999::Quasi-conjugate bayes estimates for GPD parameters and application to heavy tails modelling+Diebolt, J.; El-Aroui, M.-A.; Garrido, M.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Girard, S</span>.+Extremes+2005::Mathematical modelling and quantitative methods+Edler, L; Poirier, K; Dourson, M; et al.+FOOD AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY+FEB-MAR 2002::no title+EMBRECHTS P+APPL MATH+1999::ESTIMATING NORMAL MEANS WITH A DIRICHLET PROCESS PRIOR+ESCOBAR, MD+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1994::BAYESIAN ANALYSIS OF SOME NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS+FERGUSON, TS+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1973::Estimating a tail exponent by modelling departure from a Pareto distribution+Feuerverger, A; Hall, P+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 1999::Model-based clustering, discriminant analysis, and density estimation+Fraley, C; Raftery, AE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2002::A dynamic mixture model for unsupervised tail estimation without threshold selection+Frigessi, A; Haug, O; Rue, H.+Extremes+2002::Quantitative assessment of exposure to the mycotoxin Ochratoxin A in food+Gauchi, JP; Leblanc, JC+RISK ANALYSIS+APR 2002::Introduction to the Monte Carlo project and the approach to the validation of probabilistic models of dietary exposure to selected food chemicals+Gibney, MJ; van der Voet, H+FOOD ADDITIVES AND CONTAMINANTS+OCT 2003::Modelling heterogeneity with and without the Dirichlet process+Green, PJ; Richardson, S+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+JUN 2001::A quantitative study of gene regulation involved in the immune response of anopheline mosquitoes: An application of Bayesian hierarchical clustering of curves+Heard, NA; Holmes, CC; Stephens, DA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2006::SIMPLE GENERAL APPROACH TO INFERENCE ABOUT TAIL OF A DISTRIBUTION+HILL, BM+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1975::Gibbs sampling methods for stick-breaking priors+Ishwaran, H; James, LF+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2001::Bayesian mixture modeling for spatial Poisson process intensities, with applications to extreme value analysis+Kottas, Athanasios; Sanso, Bruno+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+OCT 1 2007::Assessment of intake from the diet+Kroes, R; Muller, D; Lambe, J; et al.+FOOD AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY+FEB-MAR 2002::Model based clustering and weighted Chinese restaurant processes+Lau, J.

Bayesian Forecasting of Prepayment Rates for Individual Pools of Mortgages,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/08-BA315,2008,20,4,This paper proposes a novel approach for modeling prepayment rates of individual pools of mortgages. The model incorporates the empirical evidence that prepayment is past dependent via Bayesian methodology. There are many factors that influence the prepayment behavior and for many of them there is no available (or impossible to gather) information. We implement this issue by creating a Bayesian mixture model and construct a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate the parameters. We assess the model on a data set from the Bloomberg Database. Our results show that the burnout effect is a significant variable for explaining normal prepayment activities. This result does not hold when prepayment is triggered by non-pool dependent events. We show how to use the new model to compute prices for Mortgage Backed Securities. Monte Carlo simulation is the traditional method for obtaining such prices and the proposed model can be easily incorporated within simulation pricing framework. Prices for standard Pass-Throughs are obtained using simulation.,"mortgages,prepayment rates,MBS pricing,Bayesian forecasting","BACKED SECURITIES,VALUATION,HETEROGENEITY,TERMINATIONS,PRICES","Popova, Ivilina@Seattle Univ, Dept Finance, Albers Sch Business & Econ, Seattle, WA 98122 USA::Popova, Elmira@Univ Texas Austin, Grad Program Operat Res & Ind Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA::George, Edward I.@Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Dept Stat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Popova, Ivilina@Seattle University::Popova, Elmira@University of Texas Austin@University of Texas System::George, Edward I.@University of Pennsylvania",not exist,"A THEORY OF THE TERM STRUCTURE OF INTEREST-RATES+COX, JC; INGERSOLL, JE; ROSS, SA+ECONOMETRICA+1985::no title+DENG Y+WOODHEAD BEHAV PRICI+2002::Mortgage terminations, heterogeneity and the exercise of mortgage options+Deng, YH; Quigley, JM; Van Order, R+ECONOMETRICA+MAR 2000::Spatial heterogeneity in mortgage terminations by refinance, sale and default+Deng, YH; Pavlov, AD; Yang, LH+REAL ESTATE ECONOMICS+WIN 2005::no title+Devroye, L.+Non-uniform random variate generation+1986::ESTIMATION OF FINITE MIXTURE DISTRIBUTIONS THROUGH BAYESIAN SAMPLING+DIEBOLT, J; ROBERT, CP+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1994::An empirical test of a two-factor mortgage valuation model: How much do house prices matter?+Downing, C; Stanton, R; Wallace, N+REAL ESTATE ECONOMICS+WIN 2005::VALUATION OF GNMA MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES+DUNN, KB; MCCONNELL, JJ+JOURNAL OF FINANCE+1981::The effect of refinancing costs and market imperfections on the optimal call strategy and the pricing of debt contracts+Dunn, KB; Spatt, CS+REAL ESTATE ECONOMICS+WIN 2005::GIBBS SAMPLING FOR MARGINAL POSTERIOR EXPECTATIONS+GELFAND, AE; SMITH, AFM+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1991::Estimating mixtures of regressions+Hurn, M; Justel, A; Robert, CP+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+MAR 2003::BAYES FACTORS+KASS, RE; RAFTERY, AE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1995::PREPAYMENTS ON FIXED-RATE MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES+RICHARD, SF; ROLL, R+JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT+SPR 1989::no title+ROBERT CP+MIXTURE APPROACH BAY+2007::PREPAYMENT AND THE VALUATION OF MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES+SCHWARTZ, ES; TOROUS, WN+JOURNAL OF FINANCE+JUN 1989::USING KERNEL DENSITY ESTIMATES TO INVESTIGATE MULTIMODALITY+SILVERMAN, BW+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1981::RATIONAL PREPAYMENT AND THE VALUATION OF MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES+STANTON, R+REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES+FAL 1995::Unobservable heterogeneity and rational learning: Pool-specific versus generic mortgage-backed security prices+Stanton, RH+JOURNAL OF REAL ESTATE FINANCE AND ECONOMICS+MAY 1996::no title+Sundaresan, S.+Fixed Income Markets and Their Derivatives+1997::no title+Timmis, G.

On some difficulties with a posterior probability approximation technique,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/08-BA316,2008,15,13,"In Scott (2002) and Congdon (2006), a new method is advanced to compute posterior probabilites of models under consideration. It is based solely of MCMC outputs restricted to single models, i.e., it is bypassing reversible jump and other model exploration techniques. While it is indeed possible to approximate posterior probabilites based solely on MCMC outputs from single models, as demonstrated by Gelfand and Dey (1994) and Bartolucci et al. (2006), we show that the proposals of Scott (2002) and Congdon (2006) are biased and advance several arguments towards this thesis, the primary one being the confusion between model-based posteriors and joint pseudo-posteriors. From a practical point of view, the bias in Scott's (2002) approximation appears to be much more severe than the one in Congdon's (2006), the latter being often of the same magnitude as the posterior probability it approximates, although we also exhibit an example where the divergence from the true posterior probability is extreme.","Bayesian model choice,posterior approximation,reversible jump,Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC),pseudo-priors,unbiasedness,improperty",BAYESIAN MODEL CHOICE,"Robert, Christian P.@Univ Paris 09, CEREMADE, F-75775 Paris 16, France@INSEE, CREST, Paris, France::Marin, Jean-Michel@INSEE, CREST, Paris, France@Univ Paris 11, INRIA Saclay, Orsay, France","Robert, Christian P.@PSL Research University Paris (ComUE)@Universite Paris-Dauphine::Marin, Jean-Michel@Universite Paris Saclay@Universite Paris Saclay (ComUE)@Inria@Universite Paris Sud - Paris 11","Marin, Jean-Michel@C-7658-2016@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7451-9719::Robert, Christian@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6635-3261","Efficient Bayes factor estimation from the reversible jump output+Bartolucci, F; Scaccia, L; Mira, A+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 2006::Efficient construction of reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo proposal distributions+Brooks, SP; Giudici, P; Roberts, GO+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2003::BAYESIAN MODEL CHOICE VIA MARKOV-CHAIN MONTE-CARLO METHODS+CARLIN, BP; CHIB, S+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1995::BAYESIAN MODEL SELECTION FOR HETEROSKEDASTIC MODELS+Chen, Cathy W.

Objections to Bayesian statistics,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/08-BA318,2008,7,64,"Bayesian inference is one of the more controversial approaches to statistics. The fundamental objections to Bayesian methods are twofold: on one hand, Bayesian methods are presented as an automatic inference engine, and this raises suspicion in anyone with applied experience. The second objection to Bayes comes from the opposite direction and addresses the subjective strand of Bayesian inference. This article presents a series of objections to Bayesian inference, written in the voice of a hypothetical anti-Bayesian statistician. The article is intended to elicit elaborations and extensions of these and other arguments from non-Bayesians and responses from Bayesians who might have different perspectives on these issues.","Foundations,Comparisons to other methods",,"Gelman, Andrew@Columbia Univ, Dept Stat, New York, NY 10027 USA@Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA","Gelman, Andrew@Columbia University",not exist,"no title+Berger, J.+Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis+1985::no title+BOX, G.

Model-based Analysis of Concept Maps,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/08-BA319,2008,48,5,"A concept map is a data collection tool developed in psychology and education to obtain information about mental representations of concept associations. This methodology has recently been introduced to marketing to study consumers' brand perceptions (John et al. (23); Joiner (24)) and attitudes towards health risk (e.g., Huang et al. (21)). In conjunction with other more established methods (e.g., Multidimensional scaling), concept maps provide an additional valuable tool for researchers to understand consumers' structural knowledge about different important marketing concepts.

Building on the introduction by John et al. (23), we propose a descriptive probability model of concept map formation, along with concept map analyses based on parameter estimates. In particular, we demonstrate how to test hypotheses about differences between two groups of maps, and how to aggregate across individual concept maps to form a ""consensus map."" To demonstrate our methodology, we apply our model to a dataset that uses concept maps to study college students' perceptions of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs), an important topic of growing interest in health marketing (e.g., Hill (20); LaTour and Pitts (28); Raghubir and Menon (40); Treise and Weigold (46)). Though parsimonious in nature, our model adequately recovers map-level, concept-level, and link-level summary statistics commonly considered by other researchers, yet rarely modeled directly.","concept maps,network analysis,Bayesian hypothesis testing","VARIABLE SELECTION,HEALTH,RISK,JUDGMENTS,KNOWLEDGE,EFFICACY,AIDS,ALGORITHM,NETWORKS,BEHAVIOR","Hui, Sam K.@Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Dept Mkt, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA::Huang, Yanliu@Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Dept Mkt, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA::George, Edward I.@Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Dept Stat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Hui, Sam K.@University of Pennsylvania::Huang, Yanliu@University of Pennsylvania::George, Edward I.@University of Pennsylvania",not exist,"Statistical mechanics of complex networks+Albert, R; Barabasi, AL+REVIEWS OF MODERN PHYSICS+JAN 2002::no title+Anderson, J.

We develop a Bayesian analysis of the skew-normal, skew-generalized-normal, skew-normal-t and skew-t-normal linear regression models under some special prior specifications for the model parameters. In particular, we show that the full posterior of the skew-normal regression model parameters is proper under an arbitrary proper prior for the shape parameter and noninformative prior for the other parameters. We implement a convenient hierarchical representation in order to obtain the corresponding posterior analysis. We illustrate our approach with an application to a real dataset on characteristics of Australian male athletes.","Posterior analysis,regression model,shape parameter,skewness,skew-normal distribution,symmetry",,"Arellano-Valle, Reinaldo B.@Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Estadist, Santiago, Chile::Castro, Luis M.@Univ Concepcion, Dept Estadist, Fac Ciencias Fis & Matemat, Concepcion, Chile::Genton, Marc G.@Texas A&M Univ, Dept Stat, College Stn, TX 77843 USA@Univ Geneva, Dept Econometr, Geneva, Switzerland::Gomez, Hector W.@Univ Concepcion, Dept Estadist, Fac Ciencias Fis & Matemat, Concepcion, Chile","Arellano-Valle, Reinaldo B.@Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile::Castro, Luis M.@Universidad de Concepcion::Genton, Marc G.@Texas A&M University System@University of Geneva@Texas A&M University College Station::Gomez, Hector W.@Universidad de Concepcion","Castro, Luis@F-4997-2013::Castro, Mauricio@E-9801-2018@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7249-5207::Gomez, Hector W.@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3726-5507","Bayesian inference for skew-normal linear mixed models+Arellano-Valle, R.

Bayesian methods for categorical data under informative censoring,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/08-BA321,2008,29,3,"Bayesian methods are presented for categorical sampling when some observations are censored (i.e., suffer missing distinctions between categories). Such problems have been researched over the years, as they can be important in applications. However, previous work has assumed strong restrictions, such as truthful reporting, noninformative censoring, etc. Here, we attempt to remove such restrictions. In particular, we remove two of the three restrictions imposed by Dickey, Jiang, and Kadane (1987). We provide Bayesian methods for cases more general than those considered by Paulino and de B. Pereira (1992, 1995), and others. Thus, it will no longer be necessary to make unrealistic assumptions commonly employed regarding the censoring model. A theorem of Identifiability-by-Conditioning is provided, allowing familiar improper prior densities. By this theorem, we obtain identical Bayesian updating results by imposing constraints on either prior, likelihood, or posterior directly. Several computational procedures are suggested, and an example is used to illustrate methods.","Bayesian inference,generalized Dirichlet distributions,informative censoring,multiple hypergeometric functions",,"Jiang, Thomas J.@Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Math Sci, Taipei 11623, Taiwan::Dickey, James M.@Univ Minnesota, Sch Stat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Jiang, Thomas J.@National Chengchi University::Dickey, James M.@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities","Jiang, Thomas J.@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3044-2470","no title+ALBERT JH+BAYESIAN STATISTICS+1985::BAYESIAN-ESTIMATION METHODS FOR 2X2 CONTINGENCY-TABLES USING MIXTURES OF DIRICHLET DISTRIBUTIONS+ALBERT, JH; GUPTA, AK+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1983::no title+ANTELMAN GR+J AM STAT ASSOC+1972::ON THE BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS OF CATEGORICAL-DATA - THE PROBLEM OF NONRESPONSE+BASU, D; PEREIRA, CAD+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+1982::no title+Carlson, B.

It is shown how the Girsanov theorem can be used for evaluating the likelihood ratios needed in importance sampling. It is also shown how the methodology can be applied to a class of models, where the driving noise process is lower in the dimensionality than the state and thus the laws of the state and the noise are not absolutely continuous.

Exact distribution theory for belief net responses,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/08-BA324,2008,10,2,"Bayesian belief networks provide estimates of conditional probabilities, called query responses. The precision of these estimates is assessed using posterior distributions. This paper discusses two claims and a conjecture by Kleiter (1996) concerning the exact posterior distribution of queries. The two claims provide conditions where a query has an exact beta distribution. The first claim is clarified by the following generalization. Assuming a BDe prior and complete data, a query has the same distribution under equivalent network structures. If the query can be represented as a network parameter under an equivalent structure, it must then have a beta distribution. Kleiter's second claim is contradicted by a counter-example. His conjecture, concerning finite mixtures of beta distributions, is also disproved.","Bayesian network,BDe prior,belief network,beta distribution,Dirichlet distribution,query response",,"Hooper, Peter M.@Univ Alberta, Dept Math & Stat Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada","Hooper, Peter M.@University of Alberta",not exist,"no title+CHICKERING MD+P 11 C UNC ART INT+1995::A BAYESIAN METHOD FOR THE INDUCTION OF PROBABILISTIC NETWORKS FROM DATA+COOPER, GF; HERSKOVITS, E+MACHINE LEARNING+OCT 1992::A characterization of the Dirichlet distribution through global and local parameter independence+Geiger, D; Heckerman, D+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 1997::LEARNING BAYESIAN NETWORKS - THE COMBINATION OF KNOWLEDGE AND STATISTICAL-DATA+HECKERMAN, D; GEIGER, D; CHICKERING, DM+MACHINE LEARNING+SEP 1995::no title+Johnson, N.

Combining multiple maps of line features to infer true position,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/08-BA325,2008,52,2,"Map positional error refers to the difference between a feature's coordinate pair on a map and the corresponding true, unknown coordinate pair. In a geographic information system (GIS), this error is propagated through all operations that are functions of position, so that lengths, areas, etc., are uncertain. Often, a map's metadata provides a nominal statement on the positional error of a map, and such information has frequently been used to study the propagation of error through such operations. This article presents a statistical model for map positional error, incorporating positional error metadata as prior information, along with map coordinates, and, in particular, the information contained in the linearity of features. We demonstrate that information in the linearity of features can greatly improve the precision of true location predictions.","GIS,linear features,lines,maps,positional error",,"Barber, Jarrett J.@Univ Wyoming, Dept Stat, Laramie, WY 82071 USA::Prager, Steven D.@Univ Wyoming, Dept Geog, Laramie, WY 82071 USA","Barber, Jarrett J.@University of Wyoming::Prager, Steven D.@University of Wyoming","Barber, Jarrett@D-2254-2010::Prager, Steven@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9830-7008","Spatial error propagation when computing linear combinations of spectral bands: The case of vegetation indices+Arbia, G; Griffith, DA; Haining, RP+ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL STATISTICS+SEP 2003::Geographical information science: geostatistics and uncertainty+Atkinson, PM+PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY+MAR 1999::Modelling map positional error to infer true feature location+Barber, Jarrett J.; Gelfand, Alan E.; Silander, John A., Jr.+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+DEC 2006::no title+BARBER JJ+CHANCE+2007::no title+BLAKEMORE M+CARTOGRAPHICA+1984::General methods for monitoring convergence of iterative simulations+Brooks, S.; Gelman, A.+Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics+1997::no title+CARROLL RJ+MONGRAPHS STAT APPL+1995::no title+Casella, G.; Berger, R.+Statistical Inference+2002::POSITIONAL ACCURACY IN SPATIAL DATABASES+CASPARY, W; SCHEURING, R+COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS+MAR-APR 1993::Theory of cartographic error and its measurement in digital data basesm+Chrisman, N.+Proceedings of AUTO-CARTO+1982::Spatial statistics in the presence of location error with an application to remote sensing of the environment+Cressie, N; Kornak, J+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+NOV 2003::no title+Cressie, N.

EM versus Markov chain Monte Carlo for Estimation of Hidden Markov Models: A Computational Perspective,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/08-BA326,2008,47,36,"Hidden Markov models (HMMs) and related models have become standard in statistics during the last 15-20 years, with applications in diverse areas like speech and other statistical signal processing, hydrology, financial statistics and econometrics, bioinformatics etc. Inference in HMMs is traditionally often carried out using the EM algorithm, but examples of Bayesian estimation, in general implemented through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling are also frequent in the HMM literature. The purpose of this paper is to compare the EM and MCMC approaches in three cases of different complexity; the examples include model order selection, continuous-time HMMs and variants of HMMs in which the observed data depends on many hidden variables in an overlapping fashion. All these examples in some way or another originate from real-data applications. Neither EM nor MCMC analysis of HMMs is a black-box methodology without need for user-interaction, and we will illustrate some of the problems, like poor mixing and long computation times, one may expect to encounter.","hidden Markov model,incomplete data,missing data,EM,Markov chain Monte Carlo,trans-dimensional Monte Carlo,computational statistics",,"Ryden, Tobias@Lund Univ, Ctr Math Sci, Lund, Sweden","Ryden, Tobias@Lund University",not exist,"Likelihood and Bayesian analysis of mixtures+Aitkin, Murray+STATISTICAL MODELLING+DEC 2001::Genomic microarrays in human genetic disease and cancer+Albertson, DG; Pinkel, D+HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS+OCT 15 2003::Chromosome aberrations in solid tumors+Albertson, DG; Collins, C; McCormick, F; et al.+NATURE GENETICS+AUG 2003::Bayesian inference for ion-channel gating mechanisms directly from single-channel recordings, using Markov chain Monte Carlo+Ball, FG; Cai, Y; Kadane, JB; et al.+PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES+AUG 8 1999::A MAXIMIZATION TECHNIQUE OCCURRING IN STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF PROBABILISTIC FUNCTIONS OF MARKOV CHAINS+BAUM, LE; PETRIE, T; SOULES, G; et al.+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1970::STATISTICAL INFERENCE FOR PROBABILISTIC FUNCTIONS OF FINITE STATE MARKOV CHAINS+BAUM, LE; PETRIE, T+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1966::no title+Bhar, R.; Hamori, S.+Hidden Markov Models.

Model-Based Inferences from Adaptive Cluster Sampling,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/08-BA327,2008,21,4,"Adaptive cluster sampling is useful for exploring populations of rare plant and animal species which cluster together because it allows sampling effort to be concentrated in areas where observed values are high. This allows more useful data to be collected with less effort than simpler sampling methods which ignore the population structure. In this paper, we take a model based approach in a Bayesian framework to make inference about the number of individuals in a sparse, clustered population. This approach allows us to use knowledge of the population to inform both the sampling design and inference, thereby making coherent use of the data in the analysis and resulting in improved population estimates. The methodology is compared to the design-based modified Horvitz-Thompson estimator through analysis of the examples presented in the defining paper of Thompson (1990).","Informative sampling,MCMC,spatial sampling,zero-inflated count data",,"Rapley, V.

Bayesian estimation of the basic reproduction number in stochastic epidemic models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/08-BA328,2008,25,14,"In recent years there has been considerable activity in the development and application of Bayesian inferential methods for infectious disease data using stochastic epidemic models. Most of this activity has employed computationally intensive approaches such as Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. In contrast, here we address fundamental questions for Bayesian inference in the setting of the standard SIR (Susceptible-Infective-Removed) epidemic model via simple methods. Our main focus is on the basic reproduction number, a quantity of central importance in mathematical epidemic theory, whose value essentially dictates whether or not a large epidemic outbreak can occur. We specifically consider two SIR models routinely employed in the literature, namely the model with exponentially distributed infectious periods, and the model with fixed length infectious periods. It is assumed that an epidemic outbreak is observed through time. Given complete observation of the epidemic, we derive explicit expressions for the posterior densities of the model parameters and the basic reproduction number. For partial observation of the epidemic, when the entire infection process is unobserved, we derive conservative bounds for quantities such as the mean of the basic reproduction number and the probability that a major epidemic outbreak will occur. If the time at which the epidemic started is observed, then linear programming methods can be used to derive suitable bounds for the mean of the basic reproduction number and similar quantities. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the practical consequences of our findings. In addition, we also examine the implications of commonly-used prior distributions on the basic model parameters as regards inference for the basic reproduction number.","Basic reproduction number,Bayesian inference,Epidemics,Linear programming,Stochastic epidemic models",,"Clancy, Damian@Univ Liverpool, Dept Math Sci, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England::O'Neill, Philip D.@Univ Nottingham, Sch Math Sci, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England","Clancy, Damian@University of Liverpool::O'Neill, Philip D.@University of Nottingham","O'Neill, Philip@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9084-8184","Stochastic Epidemic Models and Their Statistical Analysis+Andersson, H.; Britton, T.+LECT NOTES STAT+2000::Transmission of pneumococcal carriage in families: A latent Markov process model for binary longitudinal data+Auranen, K; Arjas, E; Leino, T; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2000::no title+Bailey, N T J.+The Mathematical Theory of Infectious Diseases+1975::no title+Becker, N.

Spatial Dynamic Factor Analysis,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/08-BA329,2008,53,42,"A new class of space-time models derived from standard dynamic factor models is proposed. The temporal dependence is modeled by latent factors while the spatial dependence is modeled by the factor loadings. Factor analytic arguments are used to help identify temporal components that summarize most of the spatial variation of a given region. The temporal evolution of the factors is described in a number of forms to account for different aspects of time variation such as trend and seasonality. The spatial dependence is incorporated into the factor loadings by a combination of deterministic and stochastic elements thus giving them more flexibility and generalizing previous approaches. The new structure implies nonseparable space-time variation to observables, despite its conditionally independent nature, while reducing the overall dimensionality, and hence complexity, of the problem. The number of factors is treated as another unknown parameter and fully Bayesian inference is performed via a reversible jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The new class of models is tested against one synthetic dataset and applied to pollution data obtained from the Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNet). Our factor model exhibited better predictive performance when compared to benchmark models, while capturing important aspects of spatial and temporal behavior of the data.","Bayesian inference,forecasting,Gaussian process,spatial interpolation,reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo,random fields",,"Lopes, Hedibert Freitas@Univ Chicago, Grad Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA::Salazar, Esther@Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Grad Program Stat, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil::Gamerman, Dani@Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Grad Program Stat, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil","Lopes, Hedibert Freitas@University of Chicago::Salazar, Esther@Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro::Gamerman, Dani@Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro","Lopes, Hedibert@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8429-0353","NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::Inferential theory for factor models of large dimensions.+Bai, J+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 2003::no title+Banerjee, S.; Carlin, B.

Compressing Parameters in Bayesian High-order Models with Application to Logistic Sequence Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/08-BA330,2008,17,3,"Bayesian classification and regression with high-order interactions is largely infeasible because Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) would need to be applied with a great many parameters, whose number increases rapidly with the order. In this paper we show how to make it feasible by effectively reducing the number of parameters, exploiting the fact that many interactions have the same values for all training cases. Our method uses a single ""compressed"" parameter to represent the sum of all parameters associated with a set of patterns that have the same value for all training cases. Using symmetric stable distributions as the priors of the original parameters, we can easily find the priors of these compressed parameters. We therefore need to deal only with a much smaller number of compressed parameters when training the model with MCMC. After training the model, we can split these compressed parameters into the original ones as needed to make predictions for test cases. We show in detail how to compress parameters for logistic sequence prediction models.

Computational Methods for Parameter Estimation in Climate Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/08-BA331,2008,38,19,"Intensive computational methods have been used by Earth scientists in a wide range of problems in data inversion and uncertainty quantification such as earthquake epicenter location and climate projections. To quantify the uncertainties resulting from a range of plausible model configurations it is necessary to estimate a multidimensional probability distribution. The computational cost of estimating these distributions for geoscience applications is impractical using traditional methods such as Metropolis/Gibbs algorithms as simulation costs limit the number of experiments that can be obtained reasonably. Several alternate sampling strategies have been proposed that could improve on the sampling efficiency including Multiple Very Fast Simulated Annealing (MVFSA) and Adaptive Metropolis algorithms. The performance of these proposed sampling strategies are evaluated with a surrogate climate model that is able to approximate the noise and response behavior of a realistic atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM). The surrogate model is fast enough that its evaluation can be embedded in these Monte Carlo algorithms. We show that adaptive methods can be superior to MVFSA to approximate the known posterior distribution with fewer forward evaluations. However the adaptive methods can also be limited by inadequate sample mixing. The Single Component and Delayed Rejection Adaptive Metropolis algorithms were found to resolve these limitations, although challenges remain to approximating multi-modal distributions. The results show that these advanced methods of statistical inference can provide practical solutions to the climate model calibration problem and challenges in quantifying climate projection uncertainties. The computational methods would also be useful to problems outside climate prediction, particularly those where sampling is limited by availability of computational resources.","Parametric Uncertainties,Inverse Problems,Simulated Annealing,Adaptive Metropolis,Climate Models",,"Villagran, Alejandro@Univ New Mexico, Dept Math & Stat, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA::Huerta, Gabriel@Univ New Mexico, Dept Math & Stat, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA::Jackson, Charles S.@Univ Texas Austin, Inst Geophys, Austin, TX USA::Sen, Mrinal K.@Univ Texas Austin, Inst Geophys, Austin, TX USA","Villagran, Alejandro@University of New Mexico::Huerta, Gabriel@University of New Mexico::Jackson, Charles S.@University of Texas Austin@University of Texas System::Sen, Mrinal K.@University of Texas Austin@University of Texas System","Jackson, Charles@A-2202-2009@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2870-4494::Sen, Mrinal@G-5938-2010","Do-it-yourself climate prediction+Allen, M+NATURE+OCT 14 1999::Efficient estimation and ensemble generation in climate modelling+Annan, J.

Bayesian inference for the MAPK/ERK pathway by considering the dependency of the kinetic parameters,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/08-BA332,2008,38,5,"The MAPK/ERK pathway is one of the major signal transduction systems which regulates the cellular growth control of all eukaryotes like the cell proliferation and the apoptosis. Because of its importance in cellular lifecycle, it has been studied intensively, resulting in a number of qualitative descriptions of this regulatory mechanism. In this study we describe the MAPK/ERK pathway as an explicit set of reactions by combining different sources. Our reaction set takes into account the localization and different binding sites of the molecules in the cell by implementing the multiple parametrization. Then we estimate the model parameters of the network in a Bayesian setting via MCMC and data augmentation schemes. In the estimation we apply the Euler approximation, which is the discretized version of the diffusion technique. Additionally in inference of such a realistic and complex system we consider all possible kinds of dependencies coming from distinct stages of updates. To test the inference method we use the simulated data generated by the Gillespie algorithm. From the analysis it is clear that the sampler mixes well and partially is able to identify the dynamics of the MAPK/ERK pathway.","MCMC,MAPK/ERK pathway,diffusion approximation,data augmentation,dependency in diffusion matrix",,"Purutcuoglu, Vilda@Middle E Tech Univ, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey::Wit, Ernst@Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands","Purutcuoglu, Vilda@Middle East Technical University::Wit, Ernst@University of Groningen","Wit, Ernst@C-7540-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3671-9610","no title+Bower, J.

Bayesian Hierarchical Multiresolution Hazard Model for the Study of Time-Dependent Failure Patterns in Early Stage Breast Cancer,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/07-BA223,2007,32,11,"The multiresolution estimator, developed originally in engineering applications as a wavelet-based method for density estimation, has been recently extended and adapted for estimation of hazard functions (Bouman et al. 2005, 2007). Using the multiresolution hazard (MRH) estimat or in the Bayesian framework, we are able to incorporate any a priori desired shape and amount of smoothness in the hazard function. The MRH method's main appeal is in its relatively simple estimation and inference procedures, making it possible to obtain simultaneous confidence bands on the hazard function over the entire time span of interest. Moreover, these confidence bands properly reflect the multiple sources of uncertainty, such as multiple centers or heterogeneity in the patient population. Also, rather than the commonly employed approach of estimating covariate effects and the hazard function separately, the Bayesian MRH method estimates all of these parameters jointly, thus resulting in properly adjusted inference about any of the quantities.

In this paper, we extend the previously proposed MRH methods (Bouman et al. 2005, 2007) into the hierarchical multiresolution hazard setting (HMRH), to accommodate the case of separate hazard rate functions within each of several strata as well as some common covariate effects across all strata while accounting for within-stratum correlation. We apply this method to examine patterns of tumor recurrence after treatment for early stage breast cancer, using data from two large-scale randomized clinical trials that have substantially influenced breast cancer treatment standards. We implement the proposed model to estimate the recurrence hazard and explore how the shape differs between patients grouped by a key tumor characteristic (estrogen receptor status) and treatment types, after adjusting for other important patient characteristics such as age, tumor size and progesterone level. We also comment on whether the hazards exhibit non-monotonic patterns consistent with recent hypotheses suggesting multiple hazard change-points at specific time landmarks.","Multiresolution models,Bayesian survival analysis,hazard estimation",,"Dukic, Vanja@Univ Chicago, Dept Hlth Studies, Chicago, IL 60637 USA::Dignam, James@Univ Chicago, Dept Hlth Studies, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Dukic, Vanja@University of Chicago::Dignam, James@University of Chicago","Dukic, Vanja@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0348-0834","Understanding the shape of the hazard rate: A process point of view+Aalen, OO; Gjessing, HK+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+FEB 2001::no title+Andersen, P.

Does the effect of micronutrient supplementation on neonatal survival vary with respect to the percentiles of the birth weight distribution?,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,NO DOI,2007,27,1,"Scientific Background: In developing countries, higher infant mortality is partially caused by poor maternal and fetal nutrition. Clinical trials of micronutrient supplementation are aimed at reducing the risk of infant mortality by increasing birth weight. Because infant mortality is greatest among the low birth weight in fants (LBW) (<= 2500 grams), an effective intervention may need to increase birth weight among the smallest babies. Although it has been demonstrated that supplementation increases the birth weight in a trial conducted in Nepal, there is inconclusive evidence that the supplementation improves their survival. It has been hypothesized that a potential benefit of the treatment on survival among the LBW infants is partly compensated by a null or even harmful effect among the largest infants. Exploratory analyses have suggested that the treatment effect on birth weight might vary with respect to the percentiles of the birth weight distribution.",,,"Dominici, Francesca@Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Baltimore, MD USA::Zeger, Scott L.@Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Baltimore, MD USA::Parmigiani, Giovanni@Johns Hopkins Univ, Sidney Kimmel Comprehens Canc Ctr, Baltimore, MD USA::Katz, Joanne@Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Int Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA::Christian, Parul@Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Int Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA","Dominici, Francesca@Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health@Johns Hopkins University::Zeger, Scott L.@Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health@Johns Hopkins University::Parmigiani, Giovanni@Johns Hopkins Oncology Center@Johns Hopkins University@Johns Hopkins Medicine::Katz, Joanne@Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health@Johns Hopkins University::Christian, Parul@Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health@Johns Hopkins University",not exist,"BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS OF BINARY AND POLYCHOTOMOUS RESPONSE DATA+ALBERT, JH; CHIB, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1993::Maternal zinc supplementation does not affect size at birth or pregnancy duration in Peru+Caulfield, LE; Zavaleta, N; Figueroa, A; et al.+JOURNAL OF NUTRITION+AUG 1999::Effects on birth weight and perinatal mortality of maternal dietary supplements in rural Gambia: 5 year randomised controlled trial+Ceesay, SM; Prentice, AM; Cole, TJ; et al.+BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL+SEP 27 1997::Analysis of multivariate probit models+Chib, S; Greenberg, E+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1998::Effects of maternal micronutrient supplementation on fetal loss and infant mortality: a cluster-randomized trial in Nepal+Christian, P; West, KP; Khatry, SK; et al.+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NUTRITION+DEC 2003::no title+CHRISTIAN P+BRIT MED J+2003::no title+DOMINICI F+BIOMETRIKA IN PRESS+2005::no title+DOMINICI F+BIOSTATISTI IN PRESS+2005::no title+DOMINICI F+ESTIMATING PERCENTIL+2005::Principal stratification in causal inference+Frangakis, CE; Rubin, DB+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2002::MIGHT EFFORTS TO INCREASE BIRTH-WEIGHT IN UNDERNOURISHED WOMEN DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD+GARNER, P; KRAMER, MS; CHALMERS, I+LANCET+OCT 24 1992::no title+Gelman, A.

Comparing Normal Means: New Methods for an Old Problem,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/07-BA202,2007,13,4,"Comparing the means of two normal populations is an old problem in mathematical statistics, but there is still no consensus about its most appropriate solution. In this paper we treat the problem of comparing two normal means as a Bayesian decision problem with only two alternatives: either to accept the hypothesis that the two means are equal, or to conclude that the observed data are, under the assumed model, in compatible with that hypothesis. The combined use of an information-theory based loss function, the intrinsic discrepancy (Bernardo and Rueda 2002), and an objective prior function, the reference prior (Bernardo 1979; Bergerand Bernardo 1992), produces a new solution to this old problem which has the invariance properties one should presumably require.","Bayes factor,BRC,comparison of normal means,intrinsic discrepancy,precise hypothesis testing,reference prior,two sided tests",,"Bernardo, Jose M.@Univ Valencia, Valencia, Spain::Perez, Sergio@Colegio Postgrad, Montecillo, Mexico","Bernardo, Jose M.@University of Valencia::Perez, Sergio@Colegio de Postgraduados - Mexico","Bernardo, Jose M@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3825-9328","The Case for Objective Bayesian Analysis+Berger, James+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2006::Rejoinder+Berger, James+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2006::no title+BERGER JO+BAYESIAN STAT+1992::no title+Bernardo, J.

Integral priors for the one way random effects model,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/07-BA203,2007,8,4,"The one way random effects model is analyzed from the Bayesian model selection perspective. From this point of view Bayes factors are the key tool to choose between two models. In order to produce objective Bayes factors objective priors should be assigned to each model. However, these priors are usually improper provoking a calibration problem which precludes the comparison of the models. To solve this problem several derivations of automatically calibrated objective priors have been proposed among which we quote the intrinsic priors introduced in Berger and Pericchi (1996) and the integral priors introduced in Cano et al. (2006). Here, we focus on the use of integral priors which take advantage of MCMC techniques to produce most of the times unique Bayes factors.

Dynamic Matrix-Variate Graphical Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/07-BA204,2007,31,61,"This paper introduces a novel class of Bayesian models for multivariate time series analysis based on a synthesis of dynamic linear models and graphical models. The synthesis uses sparse graphical modelling ideas to introduce structured, conditional independence relationships in the time-varying, cross-sectional covariance matrices of multiple time series. We define this new class of models and their theoretical structure involving novel matrix normal/hyper-inverse Wishart distributions. We then describe the resulting Bayesian methodology and computational strategies for model fitting and prediction. This includes novels to chastic evolution theory for time-varying, structured variance matrices, and the full sequential and conjugate updating, filtering and forecasting analysis. The models are then applied in the context of financial time series for predictive portfolio analysis. The improvements defined in optimal Bayesian decision analysis in this example context vividly illustrate the practical benefits of the parsimony induced via appropriate graphical model structuring in multivariate dynamic modelling. We discuss theoretical and empirical aspects of the conditional independence structures in such models, issues of model uncertainty and search, and the relevance of this new framework as a key step towards scaling multivariate dynamic Bayesian modelling methodology to time series of increasing dimension and complexity.","Bayesian Forecasting,Dynamic Linear Models,Gaussian Graphical Models,Graphical Model Uncertainty,Hyper-Inverse Wishart Distribution,Portfolio Analysis",,"Carvalho, Carlos M.@Duke Univ, ISDS, Durham, NC 27706 USA::West, Mike@Duke Univ, ISDS, Durham, NC 27706 USA","Carvalho, Carlos M.@Duke University::West, Mike@Duke University",not exist,"Bayesian dynamic factor models and portfolio allocation+Aguilar, O; West, M+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JUL 2000::ARCH MODELING IN FINANCE - A REVIEW OF THE THEORY AND EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE+BOLLERSLEV, T; CHOU, RY; KRONER, KF+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+APR-MAY 1992::Incorporating multiple sources of stochasticity into dynamic population models+Calder, C; Lavine, M; Muller, P; et al.+ECOLOGY+JUN 2003::no title+CARVALHO C+SIMULATION HYPERINVE+2005::HYPER MARKOV LAWS IN THE STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS OF DECOMPOSABLE GRAPHICAL MODELS+DAWID, AP; LAURITZEN, SL+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+SEP 1993::SOME MATRIX-VARIATE DISTRIBUTION-THEORY - NOTATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS AND A BAYESIAN APPLICATION+DAWID, AP+BIOMETRIKA+1981::Monte Carlo smoothing with application to audio signal enhancement+Fong, W; Godsill, SJ; Doucet, A; et al.+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING+FEB 2002::no title+Godsill, S.

A Quantitative Study of Quantile Based Direct Prior Elicitation from Expert Opinion,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/07-BA206,2007,16,10,"Eliciting priors from expert opinion enjoys more efficiency and reliability by avoiding the statistician's potential subjectivity. Since elicitation on the predictive prior probability space requires too-simple priors and may be burdened with additional uncertainties arising from the response model, quantitative elicitation of flexible priors on the direct prior probability space deserves much attention. Motivated by precisely acquiring the shape information for the general location-scale-shape family beyond the limited and simple location-scale family, we investigate multiple numerical procedures for abroad class of priors, as well as interactive graphical protocols for more complicated priors. We highlight the quantile based approaches from several aspects, where Taylor's expansion is demonstrated to be an efficient approximate alternative to work on the regions in which the shape parameter is highly sensitive. By observing inherent associations between the scale and shape parameters, we put more weight on practical solutions under a proper sensitivity index (SI) rather than presumability. Our proposed methodology is demonstrated through skew-normal and Gamma hyperparameter elicitation where the shape parameter is numerically solved in a stable way. The performance comparisons among different elicitation approaches are also provided.","location parameter,prior elicitation,quantile,scale parameter,shape,parameter,skewness,Taylor's expansion",,"Dey, Dipak K.@Univ Connecticut, Dept Stat, Storrs, CT 06269 USA@W Virginia Univ, Dept Stat, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA::Liu, Junfeng@Unknow","Dey, Dipak K.@West Virginia University@University of Connecticut::Liu, Junfeng@Unknow",not exist,"Formulation and Estimation of Stochastic Frontier Production Function Models+Aigner, D.

On the Measure of the Information in a Statistical Experiment,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/07-BA207,2007,98,16,"Setting aside experimental costs, the choice of an experiment is usually formulated in terms of the maximization of a measure of information, often presented as an optimality design criterion. However, there does not seem to be a universal agreement on what objects can qualify as a valid measure of the information in an experiment. In this article we explicitly state a minimal set of requirements that must be satisfied by all such measures. Under that framework, the measure of the information in an experiment is equivalent to the measure of the variability of its likelihood ratio statistics or which is the same, it is equivalent to the measure of the variability of its posterior to prior ratio statistics and to the measure of the variability of the distribution of the posterior distributions yielded by it. The larger that variability, the more peaked the likelihood functions and posterior distributions that tend to be yielded by the experiment, and the more informative the experiment is. By going through various measures of variability, this paper uncovers the unifying link underlying well known information measures as well as information measures that are not yet recognized as such.

The measure of the information in an experiment is then related to the measure of the information in a given observation from it. In this framework, the choice of experiment based on statistical merit only, is posed as a decision problem where the reward is a likelihood ratio or posterior distribution, the utility function is convex, the utility of the reward is the information observed, and the expected utility is the information in an experiment. Finally, the information in an experiment is linked to the information and to the uncertainty in a probability distribution,and we find that the measure of the information in an experiment is not always interpretable as the uncertainty in the prior minus the expected uncertainty in the posterior.","Convex ordering,design of experiments,divergence measure,Hellinger transform,likelihood ratio,measure of association,measure of diversity,measure of surprise,mutual information,optimal design,posterior to prior ratio,reference prior,stochastic ordering,sufficiency,uncertainty,utility,value of information",,"Ginebra, Josep@Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Estadist, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain","Ginebra, Josep@Polytechnic University of Catalonia","Ginebra, Josep@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9521-9635","A GENERAL CLASS OF COEFFICIENTS OF DIVERGENCE OF 1 DISTRIBUTION FROM ANOTHER+ALI, SM; SILVEY, SD+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1966::ASSOCIATION BETWEEN RANDOM-VARIABLES AND THE DISPERSION OF A RADON-NIKODYM DERIVATIVE+ALI, SM; SILVEY, SD+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1965::no title+BARNARD GA+J ROYAL STAT SOC B+1959::no title+BARNARD GA+J ROYAL STAT SOC B+1951::LIKELIHOOD INFERENCE AND TIME-SERIES+BARNARD, GA; JENKINS, GM; WINSTEN, CB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-GENERAL+1962::no title+Barndorff-Nielsen, OE.+Information and exponential families in statistical theory+1978::Information-Theoretic Characterization of Bayes Performance and the Choice of Priors in Parametric and Nonparametric Problems+Barron, A.

On the Multimodality of Random Probability Measures,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/07-BA208,2007,15,0,"Nonparametric methods for density estimation are examined here. Within a Bayesian setting the construction of an absolutely continuous random probability measure is often required for nonparametric statistical analysis. To achieve this we propose a ""partial convexification"" procedure of a process, such as the Dirichlet, resulting in a multimodal distribution function with a finite expected number of modes. In agreement with convexity theory results, it is shown that the derived random probability measure admits a density with respect to Lebesgue measure.","convexity,Dirichlet process,multimodal distribution functions,Polya trees,random probability measures",,"Kokolakis, George@Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Appl Math & Phys Sci, GR-10682 Athens, Greece::Kouvaras, George@Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Appl Math & Phys Sci, GR-10682 Athens, Greece","Kokolakis, George@National Technical University of Athens::Kouvaras, George@National Technical University of Athens",not exist,"MIXTURES OF DIRICHLET PROCESSES WITH APPLICATIONS TO BAYESIAN NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS+ANTONIAK, CE+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1974::FERGUSON DISTRIBUTIONS VIA POLYA URN SCHEMES+BLACKWELL, D; MACQUEEN, JB+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1973::BAYESIAN NONPARAMETRIC METHODS FOR DATA FROM A UNIMODAL DENSITY+BRUNNER, LJ+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+JUN 24 1992::BAYESIAN DENSITY-ESTIMATION AND INFERENCE USING MIXTURES+ESCOBAR, MD; WEST, M+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1995::no title+Feller, W.+An introduction to probability theory and its applications+1971::PRIOR DISTRIBUTIONS ON SPACES OF PROBABILITY MEASURES+FERGUSON, TS+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1974::BAYESIAN ANALYSIS OF SOME NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS+FERGUSON, TS+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1973::Nonparametric Bayes inference for concave distribution functions+Hansen, MB; Lauritzen, SL+STATISTICA NEERLANDICA+FEB 2002::no title+KOKOLAKIS G+BAYESIAN STAT+1996::no title+KOKOLAKIS G+STATISTICIAN+1983::MORE ASPECTS OF POLYA TREE DISTRIBUTIONS FOR STATISTICAL MODELING+LAVINE, M+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+SEP 1994::SOME ASPECTS OF POLYA TREE DISTRIBUTIONS FOR STATISTICAL MODELING+LAVINE, M+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+SEP 1992::ESTIMATING NORMAL MEANS WITH A CONJUGATE STYLE DIRICHLET PROCESS PRIOR+MACEACHERN, SN+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+1994::A CONSTRUCTIVE DEFINITION OF DIRICHLET PRIORS+SETHURAMAN, J+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 1994::Bayesian nonparametric inference for random distributions and related functions+Walker, SG; Damien, P; Laud, PW; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1999"
Improving Classification When a Class Hierarchy is Available Using a Hierarchy-Based Prior,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/07-BA209,2007,21,12,"We introduce a new method for building classification models when we have prior knowledge of how the classes can be arranged in a hierarchy, based on how easily they can be distinguished. The new method uses a Bayesian form of the multinomial logit (MNL, a.k.a. ""softmax"") model, with a prior that introduces correlations between the parameters for classes that are nearby in the tree. We compare the performance on simulated data of the new method, the ordinary MNL model, and a model that uses the hierarchy in a different way. We also test the new method on page layout analysis and document classification problems, and find that it performs better than the other methods.","Hierarchical Classification,Bayesian Models,Multinomial Logistic Regression,Page Layout Analysis,Document Classification",,"Shahbaba, Babak@Univ Toronto, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada::Neal, Radford M.@Univ Toronto, Dept Stat, Toronto, ON, Canada@Univ Toronto, Dept Comp Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada","Shahbaba, Babak@University of Toronto::Neal, Radford M.@University of Toronto",not exist,"no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical Data Analysis+2002::no title+CAI L+ACM 13 C INF KNOWL M+2004::Incremental algorithms for hierarchical classification+Cesa-Bianchi, N; Gentile, C; Zaniboni, L+JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH+JAN 2006::Large margin hierarchical classification+Dekel, O.; Keshet, J.; Singer, Y.+P 21 INT C MACH LEAR+2004::no title+DUMAIS S+P 23 ANN INT ACM SIG+2000::no title+Fox, J.+Applied Regression Analysis, Linear Models, and Related Methods+1997::no title+GOODMAN J+P IEEE INT C AC SPEE+2001::Hierarchically classifying documents using very few words+Koller, D.; Sahami, M.+P 14 INT C MACH LEAR+1997::no title+LAVEN K+C DOC AN REC ICDAR S+2005::Employing EM and pool-based active learning for text classification+McCallum, A.

Nonparametric Estimation of Kullback-Leibler Information Illustrated by Evaluating Goodness of Fit,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/07-BA210,2007,187,2,"We describe a method for quantifying the lack of fit in a proposed family of distributions. The method involves estimating the posterior distribution of the Kullback-Leibler information between the true distribution generating the data and the proposed family. We include an implementation for discrete data involving Dirichlet Processes, for continuous data involving Dirichlet Process Mixtures, and for regression data involving a common ""perturbation"" distribution also estimated by a Dirichlet Process Mixture. We examine the effectiveness of the method through simulation. We also show that, for independent, identically distributed discrete data, the posterior distribution from a Dirichlet Process provides a consistent estimate of the KL information. Because the entire posterior distribution is computed, one can readily acquire interval estimates of the distance without resorting to asymptotics.","Goodness of Fit,Kullback-Leibler Information,Consistency",,"Viele, Kert@Univ Kentucky, Dept Stat, Lexington, KY 40506 USA","Viele, Kert@University of Kentucky",not exist,"Information theory as an extension of the maximum likelihood principle+Akaike, H.+2 INT S INF THEOR+1973::HETEROSKEDASTICITY AND AUTOCORRELATION CONSISTENT COVARIANCE-MATRIX ESTIMATION+ANDREWS, DWK+ECONOMETRICA+MAY 1991::Contribution to the discussion on Professor Hotelling's paper.+Anscombe, F.

Bayesian Multivariate Areal Wombling for Multiple Disease Boundary Analysis,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/07-BA211,2007,27,16,"Multivariate data summarized over areal units (counties, zip codes, etc.) are common in the field of public health. Estimation or testing of geographic boundaries for such data may have varied goals. For example, for data on multiple disease outcomes, we may be interested in a single set of ""composite"" boundaries for all diseases, separate boundaries for each disease, or both. Different areal wombling (boundary analysis) techniques are needed to meet these different requirements. But in any case, the underlying statistical model needs to account for correlations across both diseases and locations. Utilizing recent developments in multivariate conditionally autoregressive (MCAR) distributions and spatial structural equation modeling, we suggest a variety of Bayesian hierarchical models for multivariate areal boundary analysis, including some that incorporate random neighborhood structure. Many of our models can be implemented via standard software, namely WinBUGS for posterior sampling and R for summarization and plotting. We illustrate our methods using Minnesota county level esophagus, larynx, and lung cancer data, comparing models that account for both, only one, or neither of the aforementioned correlations. We identify both composite and cancer-specific boundaries, selecting the best statistical model using the DIC criterion. Our results indicate primary boundaries in both the composite and cancer-specific response surface separating the mining-and tourism-oriented north east counties from the remainder of the state, as well as secondary (residual) boundaries in the Twin Cities metro area.","Areal data,Cancer,Multivariate conditionally autoregressive (MCAR) model,Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data",,"Ma, Haijun@Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320 USA::Carlin, Bradley P.@Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Biostat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Ma, Haijun@Amgen::Carlin, Bradley P.@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities",not exist,"no title+Banerjee, S.; Carlin, B.

Bayesian encompassing specification test under not completely known partial observability,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/07-BA212,2007,30,2,"This paper proposes the construction of a Bayesian specification test based on the encompassing principle for the case of partial observability of latent variables. A structural parametric model (null model) is compared against a non-parametric alternative (alternative model) at the level of latent variables. The null extended model is obtained by incorporating the non Euclidean parameter of the alternative model. This extension is defined through a Bayesian Pseudo-True Value, that makes the null model a reduction by sufficiency of the extended model. The same observability process is introduced in both the null and the alternative models; after integrating out the latent variables, a null and alternative statistical models are accordingly obtained. The comparison is made between the posterior measures of the non Euclidean parameter (of the alternative model) in the extended and in the alternative statistical models. The general development is illustrated with an example where only a linear combination of a latent vector is observed; in the example, the partial observability is known upto the vector defining the observed linear combination. Some identifiability issues are treated and the examples hows the operationality and some pitfalls of the proposed test, through a numerical experiment.","Bayesian encompassing,Bayesian specification test,Dirichlet prior,Partial observability",,"Almeida, Carlos@Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Stat, Louvain, Belgium::Mouchart, Michel@Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Stat, Louvain, Belgium","Almeida, Carlos@Universite Catholique Louvain::Mouchart, Michel@Universite Catholique Louvain",not exist,"no title+ALMEIDA C+0514 U CATH LOUV I S+2005::Identification of polychoric correlations: A copula approach+ALMEIDA, C.; MOUCHART, M.+Discussion Paper 03-21+2003::A note on a copula approach to polychoric correlatios+ALMEIDA, C.; MCI CHART, M.+Discussion Paper 03-22+2003::SUFFICIENT PARAMETERS - SOLUTION OF THE MINIMAL DIMENSIONALITY PROBLEM+BARANKIN, EW+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+1960::P values for composite null models+Bayarri, MJ; Berger, JO+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2000::no title+Berger, J.+Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis+1985::Testing precise hypotheses+Berger, J.

Local Influence on Posterior Distributions under Multiplicative Modes of Perturbation,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/07-BA213,2007,15,6,Any unperturbed and perturbed posterior density can formally be linked by a mixture. Many divergences between the unperturbed and perturbed posterior density-global measures of influence of the perturbation-are then essentially determined by the Fisher information with respect to the mixing parameter evaluated at the unperturbed density. It is investigated which aspect of change this Fisher information-commonly interpreted as local measure of influence captures in assessing influence of the perturbation.

Bayesian inference for an extended simple regression measurement error model using skewed priors,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/07-BA215,2007,26,4,"In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian extended regression model with two-stage priors when the covariate is positive and measured with error. Connections are made with some results in Arellano-Valle and Azzalini (2006), related to the multivariate skew-normal distributions. The usefulness of the proposed model with errors in variables, via the two-stage priors formulated by O'Hagan and Leonard (1976), is illustrated with an example abstracted from Fuller (1987, pg.18). The main advantage of this extended Bayesian approach is the use of skewed priors, typically rare in most Bayesian applications, and to treat the true value of the explanatory variable as positive, consideration that is sometimes ignored in measurement error models. Such consideration makes naturally the model identifiable, a problem that significantly has troubled users of other approaches listed in the literature. This constraint implies also a strong asymmetry in the distribution of the response variable. Strong connections are shown with results in Copas and Li (1997) on non-random samples and with Berkson models, which are important in practical applications. Extensions of Copas and Li's results for models with vector explanatory variables are presented.","Berkson model,non-informative prior,non-random sample,posterior distribution,pseudo-Bayes factor,regression calibration,structural error model,skew-normal distributions,Winbugs",,"Rodrigues, Josemar@Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Estatist, BR-13560 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil::Bolfarine, Heleno@Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Estatist, BR-13560 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil","Rodrigues, Josemar@Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos::Bolfarine, Heleno@Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos","Bolfarine, Heleno@D-6685-2012","A unified view on skewed distributions arising from selections+Arellano-Valle, Reinaldo B.; Branco, Marcia D.; Genton, Marc G.+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+DEC 2006::On the unification of families of skew-normal distributions+Arellano-Valle, Reinaldo B.; Azzalini, Adelchi+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+SEP 2006::2000a.

Assessment of Locally Influential Observations in Bayesian Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/07-BA216,2007,25,6,"In models with conditionally independent observations, it is shown that the posterior variance of the log-likelihood from observation i is a measure of that observation's local influence. This result is obtained by considering the Kullback-Leibler divergence between baseline and case-weight perturbed posteriors, with local influence being the curvature of this divergence evaluated at the baseline posterior. Case-weighting is formulated using quasi-likelihood and hence for binomial or Poisson observations, the posterior variance of an observation's log-likelihood provides a measure of sensitivity to mild mis-specification of its dispersion. In general, the case-weighted posteriors are quasi-posteriors because they do not arise from a formal sampling model. Their propriety is established under a simple sufficient condition. A second local measure of posterior change, the curvature of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between predictive densities, is seen to be the posterior variance (over future observations) of the expected log-likelihood, and can easily be estimated using importance sampling. Suggestions for identifying locally influential observations are given. The methodology is applied to a well known simple linear model dataset, to a nonlinear state-space model, and to a random-effects binary response model.","Case sensitivity,Kullback-Leibler divergence,influence,local sensitivity,predictive density,posterior density,quasi-posterior",,"Millar, Russell B.@Uni Auckland, Dept Stat, Auckland, New Zealand::Stewart, Wayne S.@Uni Auckland, Dept Stat, Auckland, New Zealand","Millar, Russell B.@University of Auckland::Stewart, Wayne S.@University of Auckland",not exist,"no title+Billingsley, P.+Probability and Measure+1979::no title+Burnham,, K.

Importance Re-sampling MCMC for Cross-Validation in Inverse Problems,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/07-BA217,2007,25,5,"This paper presents a methodology for cross-validation in the context of Bayesian modelling of situations we loosely refer to as 'inverse problems'. It is motivated by an example from palaeoclimatology in which scientists reconstruct past climates from fossils in lake sediment. The inverse problem is to build a model with which to make statements about climate, given sediment. One natural aspect of this is to examine model fit via 'inverse' cross-validation. We discuss the advantages of inverse cross-validation in Bayesian model assessment. In high-dimensional MCMC studies the inverse cross-validation exercise can be computationally burden some. We propose a fast method involving very many low-dimensional MCMC runs, using Importance Re-sampling to reduce the dimensionality. We demonstrate that, in addition, the method is particularly suitable for exploring multimodal distributions. We illustrate our proposed methodology with simulation studies and the complex, high-dimensional, motivating palaeoclimate problem.","Cross-validation,Inverse,Importance Re-sampling,Model fit,Re-use",,"Bhattacharya, S.@Univ Sheffield, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England::Haslett, J.@Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland","Bhattacharya, S.@University of Sheffield::Haslett, J.@Trinity College Dublin",not exist,"no title+Bhattacharya, S.+Importance Resampling MCMC: A methodology for cross-validation in inverse problems and its applications in model assessment+2004::no title+BHATTACHARYA S+THESIS DUKE U+2006::Fast cross validation of a palaeoclimate model using IRMCMC+Bhattacharya, S.; Haslett, J.+TIES 2004 C HELD MAI+2004::no title+Billingsley, P.+Probability and Measure+1995::Case influence analysis in Bayesian inference+Bradlow, ET; Zaslavsky, AM+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+SEP 1997::Model determination using sampling-based methods+Gelfand, A.

Identifying outliers in Bayesian hierarchical models: a simulation-based approach,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/07-BA218,2007,45,38,"A variety of simulation-based techniques have been proposed for detection of divergent behaviour at each level of a hierarchical model. We investigate a diagnostic test based on measuring the conflict between two independent sources of evidence regarding a parameter: that arising from its predictive prior given the remainder of the data, and that arising from its likelihood. This test gives rise to a p-value that exactly matches or closely approximates a cross-validatory predictive comparison, and yet is more widely applicable. Its properties are explored for normal hierarchical models and in an application in which divergent surgical mortality was suspected. Since full cross-validation is so computationally demanding, we examine full-data approximations which are shown to have only moderate conservatism in normal models. A second example concerns criticism of a complex growth curve model at both observation and parameter levels, and illustrates the issue of dealing with multiple p-values within a Bayesian framework. We conclude with the proposal of an overall strategy to detecting divergent behaviour in hierarchical models","Hierarchical models,diagnostics,outliers,distributional assumptions",,"Marshall, E.

Splitting and Merging Components of a Nonconjugate Dirichlet Process Mixture Model,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/07-BA219,2007,20,41,"The inferential problem of associating data to mixture components is difficult when components are nearby or overlapping. We introduce a new split-merge Markov chain Monte Carlo technique that efficiently classifies observations by splitting and merging mixture components of a nonconjugate Dirichlet process mixture model. Our method, which is a Metropolis-Hastings procedure with split-merge proposals, samples clusters of observations simultaneously rather than incrementally assigning observations to mixture components. Split-merge moves are produced by exploiting properties of a restricted Gibbs sampling scan. A simulation study compares the new split-merge technique to a nonconjugate version of Gibbs sampling and an incremental Metropolis-Hastings technique. The results demonstrate the improved performance of the new sampler.","Bayesian model,Markov chain Monte Carlo,split-merge moves,nonconjugate prior",,"Jain, Sonia@Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Family & Prevent Med, Div Biostat & Bioinformat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA::Neal, Radford M.@Univ Toronto, Dept Stat, Toronto, ON, Canada@Univ Toronto, Dept Comp Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada","Jain, Sonia@University of California San Diego@University of California System::Neal, Radford M.@University of Toronto",not exist,"FERGUSON DISTRIBUTIONS VIA POLYA URN SCHEMES+BLACKWELL, D; MACQUEEN, JB+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1973::no title+BLEI DM+ACM INT C P SER+2004::no title+DAHL DB+1086 U WISC DEP STAT+2003::A Bayesian mixture model for differential gene expression+Do, KA; Muller, P; Tang, F+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2005::Bayesian density estimation via mixtures of normal distributions+Ferguson, T.

Statistical genetic methodologies developed so far mostly address these problems separately using specialized models ranging from coalescence and admixture models for population structures, to hidden Markov models and renewal processes for recombination; but most of these approaches ignore the inherent uncertainty in the genetic complexity (e.g., the number of genetic founders of a population) of the data and the close statistical and biological relationships among objects studied in these problems. We present a new statistical framework called hidden Markov Dirichlet process (HMDP) to jointly model the genetic recombinations among a possibly infinite number of founders and the coalescence-with-mutation events in the resulting genealogies. The HMDP posits that a haplotype of genetic markers is generated by a sequence of recombination events that select an ancestor for each locus from an unbounded set of founders according to a 1st-order Markov transition process. Conjoining this process with a mutation model, our method accommodates both between-lineage recombination and within-lineage sequence variations, and leads to a compact and natural interpretation of the population structure and inheritance process underlying haplotype data. We have developed an efficient sampling algorithm for HMDP based on a two-level nested Polya urn scheme, and we present experimental results on joint inference of population structure, linkage disequilibrium, and recombination hotspots based on HMDP. On both simulated and real SNP haplotype data, our method performs competitively or significantly better than extant methods in uncovering the recombination hotspots a long chromosomal loci; and in addition it also infers the ancestral genetic patterns and offers a highly accurate map of ancestral compositions of modern populations.","Dirichlet Process,Hierarchical DP,hidden Markov model,MCMC,statistical genetics,recombination,population structure,SNP",,"Xing, Eric P.@Carnegie Mellon Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA::Sohn, Kyung-Ah@Carnegie Mellon Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA","Xing, Eric P.@Carnegie Mellon University::Sohn, Kyung-Ah@Carnegie Mellon University",not exist,"Finding haplotype block boundaries by using the minimum-description-length principle+Anderson, EC;

Re-considering the variance parameterization in multiple precision models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/07-BA221,2007,37,7,"Recent developments in Bayesian computing allow accurate estimation of integrals, making advanced Bayesian analysis feasible. However, some problems remain difficult, such as estimating posterior distributions for variance parameters. For models with three or more variances, this paper proposes a simplex parameterization for the variance structure, which has appealing properties and eases the related burden of specifying a reference prior. This parameterization can be profitably used in several multiple-precision models, including crossed random-effect models, many linear mixed models, smoothed ANOVA, and the conditionally autoregressive (CAR) model with two classes of neighbor relations, often useful for spatial data. The simplex parameterization has atleast two attractive features. First, it typically leads to simple MCMC algorithms with good mixing properties regardless of the parameterization used to specify the model's reference prior. Thus, a Bayesian analysis can take computational advantage of the simplex parameterization even if its prior was specified using another parameterization. Second, the simplex parameterization suggests a natural reference prior that is proper, invariant under multiplication of the data by a constant, and which appears to reduce the posterior correlation of smoothing parameters with the error precision. We use simulations to compare the simplex parameterization, with its reference prior, to other parameterizations with their reference priors, according to bias and mean-squared error of point estimates and coverage of posterior 95% credible intervals. The results suggest advantages for the simplex approach, particularly when the error precision is small. We offer results in the context of two real data sets from the fields of periodontics and prosthodontics.",,,"He, Yi@Sanofi Aventis Corp, Bridgewater, NJ USA::Hodges, James S.@Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Biostat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA::Carlin, Bradley P.@Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Biostat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","He, Yi@Sanofi-Aventis::Hodges, James S.@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities::Carlin, Bradley P.@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities",not exist,"Modeling covariance matrices in terms of standard deviations and correlations, with application to shrinkage+Barnard, J; McCulloch, R; Meng, XL+STATISTICA SINICA+OCT 2000::Bayesian analysis of agricultural field experiments+Besag, J; Higdon, D+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1999::no title+Box, GEP; Tiao, GC.+Bayesian Inference in Statistical Analysis+1992::A comparison of Bayesian and likelihood-based methods for fitting multilevel models+Browne, William J.; Draper, David+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2006::no title+Carlin, BP; Louis, TA.+Bayes and Empirical Bayes Methods for Data Analysis+2000::Rao-Blackwellisation of sampling schemes+Casella, G; Robert, CP+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1996::no title+CHEN L+BAYESIAN METHODS APP+2000::Gibbs sampling for Bayesian non-conjugate and hierarchical models by using auxiliary variables+Damien, P; Wakefield, J; Walker, S+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1999::A prior for the variance in hierarchical models+Daniels, MJ+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+SEP 1999::no title+DARBY M+PERIODONTAL ORAL HYG+1995::Prior distributions for variance parameters in hierarchical models+GELFAND, A.+Bayesian Analysis+2005::EFFICIENT PARAMETRIZATIONS FOR NORMAL LINEAR MIXED MODELS+GELFAND, AE; SAHU, SK; CARLIN, BP+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1995::Analysis of variance - Why it is more important than ever+Gelman, A+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 2005::no title+Gelman, A; Carlin, JB; Sterns, HS<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Rubin, DB</span>.+Bayesian Data Analysis+2004::no title+GELMAN A+J AM STAT A IN PRESS+2007::Parameterization and Bayesian modeling+Gelman, A+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2004::Practical Markov chain Monte Carlo+Geyer, CJ.+Stat Sci+1992::no title+Gilks, WR; Richardson, S; Spiegelhalter, DJ.+Markov chainMonte Carlo in practice+1998::no title+GUSTAFSON P+CANADIAN J IN PRESS+2007::Smoothing balanced single-error-term analysis of variance+Hodges, James S.; Cui, Yue; Sargent, Daniel J.; et al.+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 2007::On the precision of the conditionally autoregressive prior in spatial models+Hodges, JS; Carlin, BP; Fan, Q+BIOMETRICS+JUN 2003::Counting degrees of freedom in hierarchical and other richly-parameterised models+Hodges, JS; Sargent, DJ+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 2001::Markov chain Monte Carlo in practice: A roundtable discussion+Kass, RE; Carlin, BP; Gelman, A; et al.+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1998::Effects of processing parameters on physical properties of the silicone maxillofacial prosthetic materials+Lai, JH; Hodges, JS+DENTAL MATERIALS+NOV 1999::Posterior bimodality in the balanced one-way random-effects model+Liu, JN; Hodges, JS+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2003::Markov chain Monte Carlo methods based on 'slicing' the density function+Neal, R.M.+Technical Report No. 9722+1997::Slice sampling+Neal, RM+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2003::On the Simultaneous Diagonalization of Two Semi-Definite Matrices+Newcomb, RW.+Quarterly Journal of Applied Mathematics+1961::no title+Priestley, M.

Cluster Allocation Design Networks,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/07-BA222,2007,30,0,"When planning and designing a policy intervention and evaluation, it is important to differentiate between (future) policy interventions we want to evaluate, F(T), affecting ""the world"", and experimental allocations, AT, affecting ""our picture of the world"". The policy maker usually has to define a strategy that involves policy assignment and recording mechanisms that will affect the (conditional independence) structure of the data available. Causal inference is sensitive to the specification of these mechanisms. Influence diagrams have been used for causal reasoning within a Bayesian decision-theoretic framework that introduces interventions as decision nodes (Dawid 2002). Design Networks expand this framework by including experimental design decision nodes (Madrigal and Smith 2004). They provide semantics to discuss how a design decision strategy (such as a cluster randomised study) might assist the identification of intervention causal effects. The Design Network framework is extended to Cluster Allocation. It is used to assess identifiability when the experimental unit's level is different from the analysis unit's level, and to discuss the evaluation of cluster- and individual-level future policies. Cases of 'pure' cluster (all individuals in a cluster receiving the same intervention) and 'non-pure' cluster (only a subset receiving the policy) are discussed in terms of causal effects. The representation and analysis of a simplified version of a Mexican social policy programme to alleviate poverty (Progresa) is performed as an illustration of the use of Bayesian hierarchical models to make causal inferences relating to household and community level interventions.","Cluster allocation,Influence diagrams,Causal inference,Identification of policy effects,DAGs",,"Madrigal, Ana Maria@Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England","Madrigal, Ana Maria@University of Warwick",not exist,"no title+Bernardo, J.

Estimation of Faraday Rotation Measures of the Near Galactic Sky Using Gaussian Process Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/07-BA226,2007,6,7,"Our primary goal is to obtain a smoothed summary estimate of the magnetic field generated in and near to the Milky Way by using Faraday rotation measures (RM's). Each RM in our data set provides an integrated measure of the effect of the magnetic field along the entire line of sight to an extragalactic radio source. The ability to estimate the magnetic field generated locally by our galaxy and its environs will help astronomers distinguish local versus distant properties of the universe. RM's can be considered analogous to geostatistical data on a sphere. In order to model such data, we employ a Bayesian process convolution approach which uses Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for estimation and prediction. Complications arise due to contamination in the RM measurements, and we resolve these by means of a mixture prior on the errors.","Markov chain Monte Carlo,Gaussian process,error mixture model,spatial model",,"Short, Margaret B.@Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Dept Math & Stat, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA::Higdon, David M.@Los Alamos Natl Lab, Stat Sci Grp, Los Alamos, NM USA::Kronberg, Philipp P.@Los Alamos Natl Lab, Inst Geophys & Planetary Phys, Los Alamos, NM USA","Short, Margaret B.@University of Alaska Fairbanks@University of Alaska System::Higdon, David M.@Los Alamos National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)::Kronberg, Philipp P.@Los Alamos National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)",not exist,"no title+HIGDON DM+QUANTITATIVE METHODS+2002::Estimation of global temperature fields from scattered observations by a spherical-wavelet-based spatially adaptive method+Oh, HS; Li, TH+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2004::ROTATION MEASURES AND THE GALACTIC MAGNETIC-FIELD+SIMARDNORMANDIN, M; KRONBERG, PP+ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL+1980::THE FARADAY-ROTATION MEASURES OF EXTRA-GALACTIC RADIO-SOURCES+SIMARDNORMANDIN, M; KRONBERG, PP; BUTTON, S+ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES+1981::no title+WEBER R+MONTHLY WEATHER REV+1993::no title+YAGLOM AM+CORRELATION THEORY S+1987"
Invariant HPD credible sets and MAP estimators,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/07-BA227,2007,16,7,"MAP estimators and HPD credible sets are often criticized in the literature because of paradoxical behaviour due to a lack of invariance under reparametrization. In this paper, we propose a new version of MAP estimators and HPD credible sets that avoid this undesirable feature. Moreover, in the special case of non-informative prior, the new MAP estimators coincide with the invariant frequentist ML estimators.

Nonparametric elicitation for heavy-tailed prior distributions,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/07-BA228,2007,32,11,"In the context of statistical analysis, elicitation is the process of translating someone's beliefs about some uncertain quantities into a probability distribution. The person's judgements about the quantities are usually fitted to some member of a convenient parametric family. This approach does not allow for the possibility that any number of distributions could fit the same judgements.

In this paper, elicitation of an expert's beliefs is treated as any other inference problem: the facilitator of the elicitation exercise has prior beliefs about the form of the expert's density function, the facilitator elicits judgements about the density function, and the facilitator's beliefs about the expert's density function are updated in the light of these judgements. This paper investigates prior beliefs about an expert's density function and shows how many different types of judgement can be handled by this method.

This elicitation method begins with the belief that the expert's density will roughly have the shape of a t density. This belief is then updated through a Gaussian process model using judgements from the expert. The method gives a framework for quantifying the facilitator's uncertainty about a density given judgements about the mean and percentiles of the expert's distribution. A property of Gaussian processes can be manipulated to include judgements about the derivatives of the density, which allows the facilitator to incorporate mode judgements and judgements on the sign of the density at any given point. The benefit of including the second type of judgement is that substantial computational time can be saved.","Expert elicitation,Gaussian process,heavy-tailed distribution,nonparametric density estimation",,"Gosling, John Paul@Univ Sheffield, Dept Probabil & Stat, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England::Oakley, Jeremy E.@Univ Sheffield, Dept Probabil & Stat, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England::O'Hagan, Anthony@Univ Sheffield, Dept Probabil & Stat, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England","Gosling, John Paul@University of Sheffield::Oakley, Jeremy E.@University of Sheffield::O'Hagan, Anthony@University of Sheffield","O'Hagan, Anthony@B-2992-2016@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7994-0702::Gosling, John Paul@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4072-3022","An approach to the application of subjective probabilities in level 2 PSAs+Ang, ML; Buttery, NE+RELIABILITY ENGINEERING &amp; SYSTEM SAFETY+NOV 1997::Analytical random processes+Belyaev, Yu.

Then S(Y, theta) is a pivotal quantity, and it follows from simple probability calculus that the distribution of S(Y, theta(0)) is identical to the distribution of S(Y, theta(Y)), where theta(Y) is a value of theta drawn from the posterior distribution given Y. This fact makes it possible to define a large number of Bayesian model diagnostics having a known sampling distribution.

Bayesian Diagnostic Techniques for Detecting Hierarchical Structure,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/07-BA230,2007,17,5,"Motivated by an increasing number of Bayesian hierarchical model applications, the objective of this paper is to evaluate properties of several diagnostic techniques when the fitted model includes some hierarchical structure, but the data are from a model with additional, unknown hierarchical structure. Because there has been no apparent evaluation of Bayesian diagnostics used for this purpose, we start by studying the simple situation where the data come from a normal model with two-stage hierarchical structure while the fitted model does not have any hierarchical structure, and then extend this to the case where the fitted model has two-stage normal hierarchical structure while the data come from a model with three-stage normal structure. We use exact derivations, large sample approximations and numerical examples to evaluate the quality of the diagnostic techniques. Our investigation suggests two promising techniques: distribution of individual posterior predictive p values and the conventional posterior predictive p value with the F statistic as a checking function. We show that (at least) for large sample sizes these p values are uniformly distributed under the null model and are effective in detecting hierarchical structure not included in the null model. Finally, we apply these two techniques to examine the fit of a model for data from the Patterns of Care Study, a two-stage cluster sample of cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy.","F statistic,model assessment,partial posterior predictive p value,posterior predictive distribution,posterior predictive p value",,"Yan, Guofen@Univ Virginia, Div Biostat & Epidemiol, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA::Sedransk, J.@Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Stat, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA","Yan, Guofen@University of Virginia::Sedransk, J.@Case Western Reserve University",not exist,"P values for composite null models+Bayarri, MJ; Berger, JO+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2000::no title+BAYARRI MJ+STAT SCI IN PRESS+2007::SAMPLING AND BAYES INFERENCE IN SCIENTIFIC MODELING AND ROBUSTNESS+BOX, GEP+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1980::BAYESIAN AND FREQUENTIST PREDICTIVE INFERENCE FOR THE PATTERNS OF CARE STUDIES+CALVIN, JA; SEDRANSK, J+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1991::no title+Geisser, S.+Predictive Inference+1993::Model determination using predictive distributions with implementation via sampling-based methods+GELFAND, A.

Moreover, when a central limit theorem applies, we show how confidence intervals for the mean can be estimated by bounding the asymptotic variance of the ergodic average based on the equilibrium chain.

A Simulation Approach to Bayesian Emulation of Complex Dynamic Computer Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/07-BA232,2007,15,17,"In recent times, complex computer models have received wide attention in scientific research. However, in order to make conventional statistical statements regarding the scientific research, many expensive runs of the computer model are usually needed. New statistical theories, making their appearances, hold promise to alleviate the technical challenges. However, in cases where the underlying complex system is evolving with time, an effective theory for statistical analyses is lacking. In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian methodology that extends the existing methodologies to the case of complex dynamic systems. The approach described in the paper exploits the recursive nature of dynamic simulation models to give a more efficient and accurate emulator.

The motivating example, although not a real model for any physical process, may be thought of as a proxy for a model representing climate change, where it is of interest to predict, over time t, the four-dimensional proxy time series y(t) = (temperature, ice melting rate, barren land, CO2 emission). Also available are proxy observations on deforestation, recorded over time; hence treated as known. The latter is known as forcing input, denoted by z(t). The computer model is treated as a black box.

Typically, Gaussian processes are used to model unknown computer models, which we adopt in our article. In order to exploit the recursive nature of dynamic computer models, we introduce a grid within the range of the unknown function where the entire dynamic sequence is expected to lie. This grid essentially defines a look-up table. Our proposed method then assumes that conditional on the response surface on the grid, and the available training data, the future responses are approximately independent. Exploiting the properties of Gaussian process, we justify our proposal theoretically and with ample simulation studies. We also apply our proposed methodology to the motivating example.","Gaussian process,Latin hypercube sampling,Markov property,matrix normal,parallel computing,spatial interpolation",SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS,"Bhattacharya, Sourabh@Indian Stat Inst, Bayesian & Interdisciplinary Res Unit, Kolkata, India","Bhattacharya, Sourabh@Indian Statistical Institute@Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata",not exist,"Dynamic Matrix-Variate Graphical Models+Carvalho, Carlos M.; West, Mike+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2007::no title+CONTI S+56907 U SHEFF DEP PR+2007::no title+CONTI S+57107 U SHEFF DEP PR+2007::no title+CONTI S+BAYESIAN ANAL COMPLE+2004::no title+Cressie, N.

Bayesian Model Diagnostics Based on Artificial Autoregressive Errors,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/07-BA233,2007,25,2,"Hierarchical Bayes models provide a natural way of incorporating covariate information into the inferential process through the elaboration of regression equations for one or more of the model parameters, with errors that are often assumed to be i.i.d. Gaussian. Unfortunately, building adequate regression models is a complicated art form that requires the practitioner to make numerous decisions along the way. Assessing the validity of the modeling decisions is often difficult.

In this article I develop a simple and effective device for as certaining the quality of the modeling choices and detecting lack-of-fit. I specify an artificial autoregressive structure (AAR) in the probability model for the errors that incorporates the i.i.d. model as a special case. Lack-of-fit can be detected by examining the posterior distribution of AAR parameters. In general, posterior distributions that assign considerable mass to a region of the AAR parameter space away from zero provide evidence that apparent dependencies in the errors are compensating for misspecifications of some other aspects (typically conditional means) of the model. I illustrate the methodology through several examples including its application to the analysis of data on brain and body weights of mammalian species and response time data.","Allometry,Asymptotic normality,Autocorrelation,Hierarchical models,Response times",,"Peruggia, Mario@Ohio State Univ, Dept Stat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Peruggia, Mario@Ohio State University",not exist,"The intrinsic Bayes factor for model selection and prediction+Berger, JO; Pericchi, LR+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1996::STATISTICAL METHODS FOR ASSESSING AGREEMENT BETWEEN TWO METHODS OF CLINICAL MEASUREMENT+BLAND, JM; ALTMAN, DG+LANCET+FEB 8 1986::no title+Carlin, BP; Louis, TA.+Bayes and Empirical Bayes Methods for Data Analysis+2000::BAYESIAN MODEL CHOICE VIA MARKOV-CHAIN MONTE-CARLO METHODS+CARLIN, BP; CHIB, S+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1995::Symmetric diagnostics for the analysis of the residuals in regression models+Carota, C+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 2005::no title+CAROTA C+J ITALIAN STAT SOC+1998::Diagnostic measures for model criticism+Carota, C; Parmigiani, G; Polson, NG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1996::TESTING FOR SERIAL CORRELATION IN LEAST SQUARES REGRESSION .2.+DURBIN, J; WATSON, GS+BIOMETRIKA+1951::TESTING FOR SERIAL CORRELATION IN LEAST SQUARES REGRESSION .1.+DURBIN, J; WATSON, GS+BIOMETRIKA+1950::no title+Gelman, A; Carlin, JB; Sterns, HS<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Rubin, DB</span>.+Bayesian Data Analysis+2004::Posterior predictive assessment of model fitness via realized discrepancies+Gelman, A; Meng, XL; Stern, H+STATISTICA SINICA+OCT 1996::A Bayesian chi(2) test for goodness-of-fit+Johnson, VE+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 2004::no title+Judge, GG; Griffiths, WE; Hill, RC<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Lee, TC</span>.+The Theory and Practice of Econometrics+1980::BAYES FACTORS+KASS, RE; RAFTERY, AE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1995::no title+MACEACHERN SN+CASE STUIDES BAYESIA+2002::FRACTIONAL BAYES FACTORS FOR MODEL COMPARISON+OHAGAN, A+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1995::Was it a car or a cat I saw?

Explaining Species Distribution Patterns through Hierarchical Modeling,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/06-BA102,2006,74,56,"Understanding spatial patterns of species diversity and the distributions of individual species is a consuming problem in biogeography and conservation. The Cape Floristic Region(CFR) of South Africa is a global hotspot of diversity and endemism, and the Protea Atlas Project, with some 60,000 site records across the region, provides an extraordinarily rich data set to analyze biodiversity patterns. Analysis for the region is developed at the spatial scale of one minute grid-cells(similar to 37,000 cells total for the region).We report on results for 40 species of a flowering plant family Proteaceae (of about 330 in the CFR) for a defined sub region.

Using a Bayesian framework,we develop a two stage, spatially explicit, hierarchical logistic regression. Stage one models the suitability or potential presence for each species at each cell, given species attributes along with grid cell(site-level) climate, precipitation, topography and geology data using species-level coefficients, and as patial random effect.The second level of the hierarchy models, for each species, observed presence/absence at a sampling site through a conditional specification of the probability of presence at a arbitrary location in the gridcel lgiven that the location is suitable.Because the atlas data are not evenlydistributed across the landscape,gridc ells contain variable numbers of sampling localities. Indeed,some gridc cells are entirely unsampled; others have been transformed by humanintervention(agriculture,urbanization)suchthatnoneofthespeciesare there though some may have the potential to be present in the absence of disturbance. Thus the modeling takes the sampling intensity at each site into account by assuming that the total number of times that a particular species was observed with in a site follows a binomial distribution.

In fact,a range o fmodels can be examined incorporating different first and second stage specifications.This necessitates model comparison in a misaligned multilevel setting.All models are fitted using MCMC methods.A ""best""model is selected.Parameter summaries offer considerable insight. In addition, results are mapped as the model-estimated potential presence for each species a cross the domain. This probability surface provides an alternative to customary empirical ""range of occupancy"" displays. Summing yields the predicted species richness over the region. Summaries of the posterior for each environmental coefficient show which variables are most important in explaining species presence.Other biodiversity measures emerge as model unknowns.A considerable range of inference is available.We illustrate with only a portion of the analyses we have conducted, noting that these initial results describe biogeographical patterns over the modeled region remarkably well.","adaptive rejection method,Marknov random field,spatial logistic regression,species range,species richness",,"Gelfand, Alan E.@Univ Connecticut, Inst Stat & Decis Sci, Durham, NC USA::Silander, John A., Jr.@Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA::Wu, Shanshan@ING Clar, New York, NY USA::Latimer, Andrew@Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA::Lewis, Paul O.@Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA::Rebelo, Anthony G.@Natl Bot Inst, Kirstenbosch, South Africa::Holder, Mark@Florida State Univ, Sch Computat Sci & Informat Technol CSIT, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Gelfand, Alan E.@University of Connecticut::Silander, John A., Jr.@University of Connecticut::Wu, Shanshan@Unknow::Latimer, Andrew@University of Connecticut::Lewis, Paul O.@University of Connecticut::Rebelo, Anthony G.@Unknow::Holder, Mark@State University System of Florida@Florida State University","Holder, Mark@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5575-0536::Latimer, Andrew@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8098-0448","AN INDUCTIVE MODELING PROCEDURE BASED ON BAYES THEOREM FOR ANALYSIS OF PATTERN IN SPATIAL DATA+ASPINALL, R+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS+MAR-APR 1992::HABITAT MAPPING FROM SATELLITE IMAGERY AND WILDLIFE SURVEY DATA USING A BAYESIAN MODELING PROCEDURE IN A GIS+ASPINALL, R; VEITCH, N+PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING+APR 1993::An autologistic model for the spatial distribution of wildlife+Augustin, NH; Mugglestone, MA; Buckland, ST+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY+APR 1996::MEASUREMENT OF THE REALIZED QUALITATIVE NICHE - ENVIRONMENTAL NICHES OF 5 EUCALYPTUS SPECIES+AUSTIN, MP; NICHOLLS, AO; MARGULES, CR+ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS+JUN 1990::Current approaches to modelling the environmental niche of eucalypts: Implication for management of forest biodiversity+Austin, MP; Meyers, JA+FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT+SEP 1996::SPATIAL INTERACTION AND STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS OF LATTICE SYSTEMS+BESAG, J+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1974::BAYESIAN COMPUTATION AND STOCHASTIC-SYSTEMS+BESAG, J; GREEN, P; HIGDON, D; et al.+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+FEB 1995::A SIMULATED MAP OF THE POTENTIAL NATURAL FOREST VEGETATION OF SWITZERLAND+BRZEZIECKI, B; KIENAST, F; WILDI, O+JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE+JUN 1993::no title+CLARK JS+ECOLOGICAL IN PRESS+2003::The mid-domain effect: geometric constraints on the geography of species richness+Colwell, RK; Lees, DC+TRENDS IN ECOLOGY &amp; EVOLUTION+FEB 2000::no title+Cressie, N.

However, MCMC sampling can be prohibitively slow,and it is important to explore alternatives.One class of alternatives is provided by variational methods, a class of deterministic algorithms that convert inference problems into optimization problems (Opper and Saad 2001; Wainwright and Jordan 2003).Thus far, variational methods have mainly been explored in the parametric setting, in particular within the formalism of the exponential family (Attias2000; Ghahramani and Beal 2001; Bleietal .2003).In this paper, we present a variational inference algorithm for DP mixtures.We present experiments that compare the algorithm to Gibbs sampling algorithms for DP mixtures of Gaussians and present an application to a large-scale image analysis problem.","Dirichlet processes,hierarchical models,variational inference,image processing,Bayesian computation",,"Blei, David M.@Carnegie Mellon Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA::Jordan, Michael I.@Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Comp Sci & Stat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Blei, David M.@Carnegie Mellon University::Jordan, Michael I.@University of California System@University of California Berkeley",not exist,"MIXTURES OF DIRICHLET PROCESSES WITH APPLICATIONS TO BAYESIAN NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS+ANTONIAK, CE+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1974::A variational Bayesian framework for graphical models+Attias, H+ADVANCES IN NEURAL INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS 12+2000::Matching words and pictures+Barnard, K; Duygulu, P; Forsyth, D; et al.+JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH+AUG 15 2003::no title+Bertsekas, D.

In the first part we describe a simple technique using joint updating that improves the performance of the conventional probit regression algorithm. In the second part we discuss auxiliary variable methods for inference in Bayesian logistic regression, including covariate set uncertainty. Finally, we show how the logistic method is easily extended to multinomial regression models.

Bayesian Robustness Modeling Using Regularly Varying Distributions,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/06-BA106,2006,29,19,"Bayesian robustness modelling using heavy-tailed distributions provides a flexible approach to resolving problems of conflicts between the data and prior distributions. See Dawid (1973) and O'Hagan (1979, 1988, 1990), who provided sufficient conditions on the distributions in the model in order to reject the conflicting data or the prior distribution in favour of the other source of information. However, the literature has almost concentrated exclusively on robustness of the posterior distribution of location parameters; little attention has been given to scale parameters. In this paper we propose a new approach for Bayesian robustness modelling, in which we use the class of regularly varying distributions. Regular variation provides a very natural description of tail thickness in heavy-tailed distributions. Using regular variation theory, we establish sufficient conditions in the pure scale parameter structure under which is possible to resolve conflicts amongst the sources of information. We also note some important differences between the scale and the location parameters cases. Finally, we obtain new conditions in the pure location parameter structure which may be easier to verify than those proposed by Dawid and O'Hagan.","Bayesian robustness,heavy-tailed distributions,conflicting information,regular variation,credence",,"Andrade, J.

"Deconvolution in High-Energy Astrophysics: Science, Instrumentation, and Methods",BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/06-BA107,2006,68,5,"In recent years, there has been an avalanche of new data in observational high-energy astrophysics. Recently launched or soon-to-be launched space-based telescopes that are designed to detect and map ultra-violet, X-ray, and gamma-ray electromagnetic emission are opening a whole new window to study the cosmos. Because the production of high-energy electromagnetic emission requires temperatures of millions of degrees and is an indication of the release of vast quantities of stored energy, these instruments give a completely new perspective on the hot and turbulent regions of the universe. The new instrumentation allows for very high resolution imaging, spectral analysis, and time series analysis; the Chandra X-ray Observatory, for example, produces images atleast thirty times sharper than any previous X-ray telescope. The complexity of the instruments, of the astronomical sources, and of the scientific questions leads to a subtle inference problem that requires sophisticated statistical tools. For example, data are subject to non-uniform stochastic censoring, heteroscedastic errors in measurement, and background contamination. Astronomical sources exhibit complex and irregular spatial structure. Scientists wish to draw conclusions as to the physical environment and structure of the source, the processes and laws which govern the birth and death of planets, stars, and galaxies, and ultimately the structure and evolution of the universe.

The California-Harvard Astrostatistics Collaboration is a group of astrophysicists and statisticians working together to develop statistical methods, computational techniques, and freely available software to address outstanding inferential problems in high-energy astrophysics. We emphasize fully model-based statistical inference; we explicitly model the complexities of both astronomical sources and the data generation mechanisms inherent in new high-tech instruments, and fully utilize the resulting highly structured models in learning about the underlying astronomical and physical processes. Using these models requires sophisticated scientific computation, advanced methods for statistical inference, and careful model checking procedures.

Here we discuss the broad scientific goals of observation high-energy astrophysics, the specifics of the data collection mechanism involved with the Chandra X-ray Observatory, current statistical methods, and the Bayesian models and methods that we propose. We illustrate our statistical strategy in the context of several applied examples, including the estimation of hardness ratios, spectral analysis, multiscale image analysis, and reconstruction of the distribution of the temperature of hot plasma in a stellar corona.

Inferring Particle Distribution in a Proton Accelerator Experiment,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/06-BA108,2006,12,3,"A beam of protons is produced by a linear charged particle accelerator, then focused through the use of successive quadrupoles. The initial state of the beam is unknown, in terms of particle position and momentum. Wire scans provide the only available data on the current state of the beam as it passes through and beyond the focusing region; the goal is to infer the initial state from these position histograms. This set up is that of an inverse problem, in which a computer simulator is used to link an initial state configuration to observable values (wire scans), and then inference is performed for the distribution of the initial state. Our Bayesian approach allows estimation of uncertainty in our initial distributions and beam predictions.","computer simulator,inverse problem,exponentially-dampened cosine correlation",,"Lee, Herbert K.

Bayesian nonparametric estimation of the radiocarbon calibration curve,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/06-BA109,2006,20,5,"The process of calibrating radiocarbon determinations onto the calender scale involves, as a first stage, the estimation of the relationship between calender and radiocarbon ages (the radiocarbon calibration curve) from a set of avaiable high-precision calibration data. Traditionally the radiocarbon calibration curve has been constructed by forming a weighted average of the data, and then taking the curve as the piece-wise linear function joining the resulting calibration data points. Alternative proposals for creating a calibration curve from the averaged data involve a spline or cubic interpolation, or the use fo Fourier transformation and other filtering techniques, in order to obtain a smooth calibration curve. Between the various approaches, there is no consensus as to how to make use of data in order to solve the problems related to the calibration of radiocarbon determinations.

We propose a nonparametric Bayesian solution to the problem of the estimation of the radiocarbon calibration curve, based on a Gaussian process prior structure on the space of possible functions. Our approach is model-based, taking into account specific characteristics of the dating method, and provides a generic solution to the problem of estimating calibration curves for chronology building.

We apply our method to the 1998 international high-precision calibration dataset, and demonstrate that our model predicitions are well calibrated and have smaller variances than other methods. These data have deficiences and complications that will only be unravedlled with the publicaiton of new data, expected in early 2005, but this analysis suggests that the nonparametric Bayesian model will allow more precise calibration of radiocarbon ages for archeaological specimans.","Gaussian process,archeology,chronology building,cross-validation",,"Buck, Caitlin E.@Univ Sheffield, Dept Probabil & Stat, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England::Aguilar, Delil Gomez Portugal@Univ Sheffield, Dept Probabil & Stat, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England::Litton, Cliff D.@Univ Nottingham, Sch Math Sci, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England::O'Hagan, Anthony@Univ Sheffield, Dept Probabil & Stat, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England","Buck, Caitlin E.@University of Sheffield::Aguilar, Delil Gomez Portugal@University of Sheffield::Litton, Cliff D.@University of Nottingham::O'Hagan, Anthony@University of Sheffield","O'Hagan, Anthony@B-2992-2016@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7994-0702::Buck, Caitlin@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0872-9504","Novel statistical model for a piece-wise linear radiocarbon calibration curve+Aguilar, DGP; Litton, CD; O'Hagan, A+RADIOCARBON+2002::no title+AITKIN M+LONGMAN ARCHAEOLOGIC+1990::Extremely large variations of atmospheric C-14 concentration during the last glacial period+Beck, JW; Richards, DA; Edwards, RL; et al.+SCIENCE+JUN 29 2001::no title+Bowman, S.+Radiocarbon Dating.

Who Wrote Ronald Reagan's Radio Addresses?,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/06-BA110,2006,38,25,"In his campaign for the U. S. presidency from 1975 to 1979, Ronald Reagan delivered over 1000 radio broadcasts. For over 600 of these we have direct evidence of Reagan's authorship. The aim of this study was to determine the authorship of 312 of the broadcasts for which no direct evidence is available. We addressed the prediction problem for speeches delivered in different epochs and we explored a wide range of off-the-shelf classification methods and fully Bayesian generative models. Eventually we produced separate sets of predictions using the most accurate classifiers, based on non-contextual words as well as on semantic features, for the 312 speeches of uncertain authorship. All the predictions agree on 135 of the ""unknown"" speeches, whereas the fully Bayesian models agree on an additional 154 of them.

The magnitude of the posterior odds of authorship led us to conclude that Ronald Reagan drafted 167 speeches and was aided in the preparation of the remaining 145. Our inferences were not sensitive to ""reasonable"" variations in the sets of constants underlying the prior distributions, and the cross-validated accuracy of our best fully Bayesian model was above 90 percent in all cases. The agreement of multiple methods for predicting the authorship for the ""unknown"" speeches reinforced our confidence in the accuracy of our classifications.","Ronald Reagan,Radio Addresses,Authorship,Stylometry,Data Mining,Classification,Function Words,Semantic Analysis,Naive Bayes,Full Bayes,Poisson,Negative-Binomial,Modal Approximation,Mean Approximation",,"Airoldi, Edoardo M.@Carnegie Mellon Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA::Anderson, Annelise G.@Stanford Univ, Hoover Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA::Fienberg, Stephen E.@Carnegie Mellon Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA@Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Stat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA::Skinner, Kiron K.@Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Hist, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA@Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Social & Decis Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA","Airoldi, Edoardo M.@Carnegie Mellon University::Anderson, Annelise G.@Stanford University::Fienberg, Stephen E.@Carnegie Mellon University::Skinner, Kiron K.@Carnegie Mellon University","Airoldi, Edoardo@A-8575-2009::Airoldi, Edoardo@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3512-0542","Who Wrote Ronald Reagan's Radio Addresses?+Airoldi, E.

Model-based subspace clustering,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/06-BA111,2006,24,35,"We discuss a model-based approach to identifying clusters of objects based on subsets of attributes, so that the attributes the distinguish a cluster from the rest of the population may depend on the cluster being considered. The method is based on the Polya urn cluster model for multivariate means and variances, resulting in a multivariate Dirichlet process mixture model. This particular model-based approach accommodates outliers and allows for the incorporation of application-specific data features into the clustering scheme.

A Tractable State-Space Model for Symmetric Positive-Definite Matrices,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/14-BA888,DEC 2014,54,4,"The Bayesian analysis of a state-space model includes computing the posterior distribution of the system's parameters as well as its latent states. When the latent states wander around R-n there are several well-known modeling components and computational tools that may be profitably combined to achieve this task. When the latent states are constrained to a strict subset of R-n these models and tools are either impaired or break down completely. State-space models whose latent states are covariance matrices arise in finance and exemplify the challenge of devising tractable models in the constrained setting. To that end, we present a state-space model whose observations and latent states take values on the manifold of symmetric positive-definite matrices and for which one may easily compute the posterior distribution of the latent states and the system's parameters as well as filtered distributions and one-step ahead predictions. Employing the model within the context of finance, we show how one can use realized covariance matrices as data to predict latent time-varying covariance matrices. This approach out-performs factor stochastic volatility.","backward sample,forward filter,realized covariance,stochastic volatility","MULTIVARIATE STOCHASTIC VOLATILITY,WISHART,RISK,BETA","Windle, Jesse@Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA::Carvalho, Carlos M.@Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Windle, Jesse@Duke University::Carvalho, Carlos M.@University of Texas Austin@University of Texas System",not exist,"Bayesian dynamic factor models and portfolio allocation+Aguilar, O; West, M+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JUL 2000::The distribution of realized stock return volatility+Andersen, TG; Bollerslev, T; Diebold, FX; et al.+JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS+JUL 2001::The structure of dynamic correlations in multivariate stochastic volatility models+Asai, Manabu; McAleer, Michael+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUN 2009::Realized kernels in practice: trades and quotes+Barndorff-Nielsen, O.

Adaptive Priors Based on Splines with Random Knots,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/14-BA879,DEC 2014,15,6,"Splines are useful building blocks when constructing priors on nonparametric models indexed by functions. Recently it has been established in the literature that hierarchical adaptive priors based on splines with a random number of equally spaced knots and random coefficients in the B-spline basis corresponding to those knots lead, under some conditions, to optimal posterior contraction rates, over certain smoothness functional classes. In this paper we extend these results for when the location of the knots is also endowed with a prior. This has already been a common practice in Markov chain Monte Carlo applications, but a theoretical basis in terms of adaptive contraction rates was missing. Under some mild assumptions, we establish a result that provides sufficient conditions for adaptive contraction rates in a range of models, over certain functional classes of smoothness up to the order of the splines that are used. We also present some numerical results illustrating how such a prior adapts to inhomogeneous variability (smoothness) of the function in the context of nonparametric regression.","Adaptive prior,Bayesian non-parametric,optimal contraction rate,spline,random knots","POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTIONS,RATES,CONVERGENCE","Belitser, Eduard@Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands::Serra, Paulo@Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany","Belitser, Eduard@Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam::Serra, Paulo@University of Gottingen",not exist,"Adaptive Bayesian inference on the mean of an infinite-dimensional normal distribution+Belitser, E; Ghosal, S+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2003::Efficient construction of reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo proposal distributions+Brooks, SP; Giudici, P; Roberts, GO+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2003::no title+De Boor, C.+A practical guide to splines+1978::Adaptive estimation of multivariate functions using conditionally Gaussian tensor-product spline priors+de Jonge, R.; van Zanten, J.

Stratified Graphical Models - Context-Specific Independence in Graphical Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/14-BA882,DEC 2014,34,8,"Theory of graphical models has matured over more than three decades to provide the backbone for several classes of models that are used in a myriad of applications such as genetic mapping of diseases, credit risk evaluation, reliability and computer security. Despite their generic applicability and wide adoption, the constraints imposed by undirected graphical models and Bayesian networks have also been recognized to be unnecessarily stringent under certain circumstances. This observation has led to the proposal of several generalizations that aim at more relaxed constraints by which the models can impose local or context-specific dependence structures. Here we consider an additional class of such models, termed stratified graphical models. We develop a method for Bayesian learning of these models by deriving an analytical expression for the marginal likelihood of data under a specific subclass of decomposable stratified models. A non-reversible Markov chain Monte Carlo approach is further used to identify models that are highly supported by the posterior distribution over the model space. Our method is illustrated and compared with ordinary graphical models through application to several real and synthetic datasets.","Graphical Model,Context-Specific Interaction Model,Markov Chain Monte Carlo,Bayesian Model Learning,Multivariate Discrete Distribution","CONTINGENCY-TABLES,MARKOV-CHAINS,SELECTION,NETWORKS,SEARCH,MCMC","Nyman, Henrik@Abo Akad Univ, Dept Math, Turku, Finland::Pensar, Johan@Abo Akad Univ, Dept Math, Turku, Finland::Koski, Timo@KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Math, Stockholm, Sweden::Corander, Jukka@Univ Helsinki, Dept Math & Stat, Helsinki, Finland","Nyman, Henrik@Abo Akademi University::Pensar, Johan@Abo Akademi University::Koski, Timo@Royal Institute of Technology::Corander, Jukka@University of Helsinki",not exist,"BAYESIAN ANALYSIS OF VARIABLE-ORDER, REVERSIBLE MARKOV CHAINS+Bacallado, Sergio+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2011::no title+Bache, Kevin; Lichman, Moshe.+UCI machine learning repository+2013::no title+Bishop, YM; Light, RJ; Mosteller, F.+Discrete multivariate analysis: theory and practice+2007::Context-Specific Independence in Bayesian Networks+Boutilier, Craig; Friedman, Nir; Goldszmidt, Moises<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Koller, Daphne</span>.+P 12 ANN C UNC ART I+1996::Variable length Markov chains+Buhlmann, P; Wyner, AJ+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 1999::A BAYESIAN METHOD FOR THE INDUCTION OF PROBABILISTIC NETWORKS FROM DATA+COOPER, GF; HERSKOVITS, E+MACHINE LEARNING+OCT 1992::Bayesian graphical model determination using decision theory+Corander, J+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+MAY 2003::Labelled graphical models+Corander, J+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+SEP 2003::Parallell interacting MCMC for learning of topologies of graphical models+Corander, Jukka; Ekdahl, Magnus; Koski, Timo+DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY+DEC 2008::Bayesian model learning based on a parallel MCMC strategy+Corander, Jukka; Gyllenberg, Mats; Koski, Timo+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+DEC 2006::MARKOV-FIELDS AND LOG-LINEAR INTERACTION MODELS FOR CONTINGENCY-TABLES+DARROCH, JN; LAURITZEN, SL; SPEED, TP+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1980::HYPER MARKOV LAWS IN THE STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS OF DECOMPOSABLE GRAPHICAL MODELS+DAWID, AP; LAURITZEN, SL+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+SEP 1993::Markov chain Monte Carlo model determination for hierarchical and graphical log-linear models+Dellaportas, P; Forster, JJ+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1999::A FAST PROCEDURE FOR MODEL SEARCH IN MULTIDIMENSIONAL CONTINGENCY-TABLES+EDWARDS, D; HAVRANEK, T+BIOMETRIKA+1985::Decomposable log-linear models+Eriksen, P.S.+Technical Report+2005::Context specific interaction models+Eriksen, P.S.+Technical Report+1999::no title+FRIEDMAN N+P 12 C UNC ART INT+1996::Stratified exponential families: Graphical models and model selection+Geiger, D; Heckerman, D; King, H; et al.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2001::Decomposable graphical Gaussian model determination+Giudici, P; Green, PJ+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1999::Improving Markov Chain Monte Carlo model search for data mining+Giudici, P; Castelo, R+MACHINE LEARNING+JAN-FEB 2003::no title+Golumbic, M.

The Evidentiary Credible Region,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/14-BA883,DEC 2014,15,1,"Many disparate definitions of Bayesian credible intervals and regions are in use, which can lead to ambiguous presentation of results. It is particularly unsatisfactory when intervals are specified that do not match the one-sided character of the evidence. We suggest that a sensible resolution is to use the parameterization-independent region that maximizes the information gain between the initial prior and posterior distributions, as assessed by their Kullback-Leibler divergence, subject to the constraint on included posterior probability. This turns out to be equivalent to the relative surprise region previously defined by Evans (1997), and thus provides information theoretic support for its use. We also show that this region is the constrained optimizer over the posterior measure of any strictly monotonic function of the likelihood, which explains its many optimal properties, and that it is guaranteed to be consistent with the sidedness of the evidence. Because all of its equivalent derivations depend on the evidence as well as on the posterior distribution, we suggest that it be called the evidentiary credible region.","credible region,credible interval,highest posterior density,parameterization invariance,Kullback-Leibler,information gain,relative surprise region","BAYESIAN-INFERENCE,RELATIVE SURPRISE","Shalloway, David@Cornell Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Shalloway, David@Cornell University",not exist,"Hypothesis Assessment and Inequalities for Bayes Factors and Relative Belief Ratios+Baskurt, Zeynep; Evans, Michael+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2013::THE FORMAL DEFINITION OF REFERENCE PRIORS+Berger, James O.; Bernardo, Jose M.; Sun, Dongchu+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2009::REFERENCE POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTIONS FOR BAYESIAN-INFERENCE+BERNARDO, JM+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1979::Intrinsic credible regions: An objective Bayesian approach to interval estimation+Bernardo, JM+TEST+DEC 2005::no title+Box, G E P; Tiao, G C.+Bayesian Inference in Statistical Analysis+1992::no title+Casella, G.; Berger, R.

A new class of priors based on Hellinger information is introduced as Hellinger priors. The main results establish the relationship of Hellinger priors to the Jeffreys' rule priors in the regular case, and to the reference and probability matching priors for the nonregular class introduced by Ghosal and Samanta. These priors are also studied for some non-regular examples outside of this class. Their behavior proves to be similar to that of the reference priors considered by Berger, Bernardo, and Sun, however some differences are observed. For the multi-parameter case, a combination of Hellinger priors and reference priors is suggested and some examples are considered.","non-informative prior,Jeffreys' rule,reference prior,matching probability prior,Hellinger distance,Hellinger information","POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTIONS,INEQUALITIES,RISK","Shemyakin, Arkady@Univ St Thomas, St Paul, MN 55105 USA","Shemyakin, Arkady@University of St Thomas Minnesota",not exist,"On the development of the reference prior method+Berger, J O; Bernardo, J M.+Bayesian Stat.+1992::THE FORMAL DEFINITION OF REFERENCE PRIORS+Berger, James O.; Bernardo, Jose M.; Sun, Dongchu+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2009::ESTIMATING A PRODUCT OF MEANS - BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS WITH REFERENCE PRIORS+BERGER, JO; BERNARDO, JM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1989::REFERENCE POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTIONS FOR BAYESIAN-INFERENCE+BERNARDO, JM+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1979::On a measure of divergence between two statistical populations defined by their probability distributions+Bhattacharyya, A.+Bulletin of the Calcutta Mathematical Society+09 1943::Non-asymptotic minimax risk for Hellinger balls+Birge, L.+Probability and Mathematical Statistics+1985::SOME CLASSES OF GLOBAL CRAMER-RAO BOUNDS+BOBROVSKY, BZ; MAYERWOLF, E; ZAKAI, M+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1987::no title+Borovkov, A.

Equivalence between the Posterior Distribution of the Likelihood Ratio and a p-value in an Invariant Frame,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/14-BA877,DEC 2014,49,0,"The Posterior distribution of the Likelihood Ratio (PLR) is proposed by Dempster in 1973 for significance testing in the simple vs. composite hypothesis case. In this hypothesis test case, classical frequentist and Bayesian hypothesis tests are irreconcilable, as emphasized by Lindley's paradox, Berger & Se Ike in 1987 and many others. However, Dempster shows that the PLR (with inner threshold 1) is equal to the frequentist p-value in the simple Gaussian case. In 1997, Aitkin extends this result by adding a nuisance parameter and showing its asymptotic validity under more general distributions. Here we extend the reconciliation between the PLR and a frequentist p-value for a finite sample, through a framework analogous to the Stein's theorem frame in which a credible (Bayesian) domain is equal to a confidence (frequentist) domain.","hypothesis testing,PLR,p-value,likelihood ratio,frequentist and Bayesian reconciliation,Lindley's paradox,invariance","POINT NULL HYPOTHESIS,BAYES FACTORS,STATISTICAL-INFERENCE,HAAR MEASURE,FREQUENTIST,CALIBRATION,PROBABILITY,ACCURACY,PARADOX,MODELS","Smith, Isabelle@IPSL CNRS, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France@Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, CNRS, Observ Cote Azur, Lab H Fizeau, Nice, France::Ferrari, Andre@Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, CNRS, Observ Cote Azur, Lab JL Lagrange, Nice, France","Smith, Isabelle@Universite Paris Saclay (ComUE)@University of Nice Sophia Antipolis@CEA@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)@Universite de Versailles Saint-Quentin-En-Yvelines::Ferrari, Andre@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)@University of Nice Sophia Antipolis",not exist,"no title+Aitkin, M.+Statistical Inference: an Integrated Bayesian/Likelihood Approach+2010::Bayesian point null hypothesis testing via the posterior likelihood ratio+Aitkin, M; Boys, RJ; Chadwick, T+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+JUL 2005::The calibration of P-values, posterior Bayes factors and the AIC from the posterior distribution of the likelihood+Aitkin, M+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+DEC 1997::BAYESIAN MODEL COMPARISON AND MODEL AVERAGING FOR SMALL-AREA ESTIMATION+Aitkin, Murray; Liu, Charles C.; Chadwick, Tom+ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS+MAR 2009::Hypothesis Assessment and Inequalities for Bayes Factors and Relative Belief Ratios+Baskurt, Zeynep; Evans, Michael+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2013::no title+Berger, J.+Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis+1985::Testing precise hypotheses+Berger, J.

A Stochastic Variational Framework for Fitting and Diagnosing Generalized Linear Mixed Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/14-BA885,DEC 2014,66,5,"In stochastic variational inference, the variational Bayes objective function is optimized using stochastic gradient approximation, where gradients computed on small random subsets of data are used to approximate the true gradient over the whole data set. This enables complex models to be fit to large data sets as data can be processed in mini-batches. In this article, we extend stochastic variational inference for conjugate-exponential models to nonconjugate models and present a stochastic nonconjugate variational message passing algorithm for fitting generalized linear mixed models that is scalable to large data sets. In addition, we show that diagnostics for prior-likelihood conflict, which are useful for Bayesian model criticism, can be obtained from nonconjugate variational message passing automatically, as an alternative to simulation-based Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.

Robust Bayesian Graphical Modeling Using Dirichlet t-Distributions,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/13-BA856,2014,30,8,"Bayesian graphical modeling provides an appealing way to obtain uncertainty estimates when inferring network structures, and much recent progress has been made for Gaussian models. For more robust inferences, it is natural to consider extensions to t-distribution models. We argue that the classical multivariatet-distribution, defined using a single latent Gamma random variable to rescale a Gaussian random vector,is of little use in more highly multivariate settings,and propose other, more exiblet-distributions. Using an independent Gamma-divisor for each component of the random vector defines what we term the alternative t-distribution. The associated model allows one to extract information from highly multivariate data even when most experiments contain outliers for some of their measurements. However,the use of this alternative model comes at increased computational cost and imposes constraints on the achievable correlation structures, raising the need for a compromise between the classical and alternative models. To this end we propose the use of Dirichlet processes for adaptive clustering of the latent Gamma-scalars, each of which may then divide a group of latent Gaussian variables. The resulting Dirichlett-distribution interpolates naturally between the two extreme cases of the classical and alternative t-distributions and combines more appealing modeling of the multivariate dependence structure with favorable computational properties.","Bayesian inference,Dirichlet process,graphical model,Markov chain,Monte Carlo,t-distribution","NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS,INFERENCE,MIXTURES","Finegold, Michael@Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Stat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA::Drton, Mathias@Univ Washington, Dept Stat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Finegold, Michael@Carnegie Mellon University::Drton, Mathias@University of Washington@University of Washington Seattle","Drton, Mathias@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5614-3025","MIXTURES OF DIRICHLET PROCESSES WITH APPLICATIONS TO BAYESIAN NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS+ANTONIAK, CE+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1974::Bayesian covariance matrix estimation using a mixture of decomposable graphical models+Armstrong, Helen; Carter, Christopher K.; Wong, Kin Foon Kevin; et al.+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+SEP 2009::Monte Carlo method for computing the marginal likelihood in nondecomposable Gaussian graphical models+Atay-Kayis, A; Massam, H+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 2005::Objective Bayesian model selection in Gaussian graphical models+Carvalho, C.; Scott, J.+Biometrika+2009::Simulation of hyper-inverse Wishart distributions in graphical models+Carvalho, Carlos M.; Massam, Helene; West, Mike+BIOMETRIKA+AUG 2007::Probabilistic Networks and Expert Systems+Cowell, R.G.; Dawid, A.P.; Lauritzen, S.L.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Spiegelhalter, D.J</span>.+Statistics for Engineering and Information Science+1999::HYPER MARKOV LAWS IN THE STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS OF DECOMPOSABLE GRAPHICAL MODELS+DAWID, AP; LAURITZEN, SL+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+SEP 1993::The Bayesian Approach to the Rejection of Outliers.+De Finetti, B.+Contributions to the Theory of Statistics+1961::Bayesian inference for nondecomposable graphical gaussian models+Dellaportas, P.; Giudici, P.; Roberts, G.+Sankhya, Ser.

Informative g-Priors for Logistic Regression,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/14-BA868,2014,21,10,"Eliciting information from experts for use in constructing prior distributions for logistic regression coefficients can be challenging. The task is especially difficult when the model contains many predictor variables, because the expert is asked to provide summary information about the probability of ""success"" for many subgroups of the population. Often, however, experts are confident only in their assessment of the population as a whole. This paper is about incorporating such overall information easily into a logistic regression data analysis using g-priors. We present a version of the g-prior such that the prior distribution on the overall population logistic regression probabilities of success can be set to match a beta distribution. A simple data augmentation formulation allows implementation in standard statistical software packages.","Binomial regression,Generalized linear model,Prior elicitation","GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS","Hanson, Timothy E.@Univ S Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208 USA::Branscum, Adam J.@Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA::Johnson, Wesley O.@Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA USA","Hanson, Timothy E.@University of South Carolina System@University of South Carolina@University of South Carolina Columbia::Branscum, Adam J.@Oregon State University@Oregon University System::Johnson, Wesley O.@University of California Irvine@University of California System","Hanson, Timothy@A-9127-2016","no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical data analysis+2013::LOGISTIC-NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS - SOME PROPERTIES AND USES+AITCHISON, J; SHEN, SM+BIOMETRIKA+1980::A new perspective on priors for generalized linear models+Bedrick, EJ; Christensen, R; Johnson, W+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1996::Hyper-g priors for generalized linear models+Bove, D.; Held, L.+Bayesian Analysis+2011::Properties and Implementation of Jeffreys's Prior in Binomial Regression Models+Chen, Ming-Hui; Ibrahim, Joseph G.; Kim, Sungduk+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2008::no title+Christensen, R; Johnson, W; Branscum, A<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Hanson, TE</span>.+Bayesian ideas and data analysis: an introduction for scientists and statisticians+2010::BIAS REDUCTION OF MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATES+FIRTH, D+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1993::BAYESIAN VARIABLE SELECTION USING COST-ADJUSTED BIC, WITH APPLICATION TO COST-EFFECTIVE MEASUREMENT OF QUALITY OF HEALTH CARE+Fouskakis, D.; Ntzoufras, I.; Draper, D.+ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS+JUN 2009::A WEAKLY INFORMATIVE DEFAULT PRIOR DISTRIBUTION FOR LOGISTIC AND OTHER REGRESSION MODELS+Gelman, Andrew; Jakulin, Aleks; Pittau, Maria Grazia; et al.+ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS+DEC 2008::AN INFORMATION MATRIX PRIOR FOR BAYESIAN ANALYSIS IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MODELS WITH HIGH DIMENSIONAL DATA+Gupta, Mayetri; Ibrahim, Joseph G.+STATISTICA SINICA+OCT 2009::On robustness and model flexibility in survival analysis: Transformed hazard models and average effects+Gustafson, Paul+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2007::Fixing the nonconvergence bug in logistic regression with SPLUS and SAS+Heinze, G; Ploner, M+COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE+JUN 2003::ON BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS OF GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS USING JEFFREYS PRIOR+IBRAHIM, JG; LAUD, PW+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1991::A class of mixtures of dependent tail-free processes+Jara, A.; Hanson, T.

"Cluster Analysis, Model Selection, and Prior Distributions on Models",BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/14-BA869,2014,0,5,"Clustering is an important and challenging statistical problem for which there is an extensive literature. Modeling approaches include mixture models and product partition models. Here we develop a product partition model and a Bayesian model selection procedure based on Bayes factors from intrinsic priors. We also find that the choice of the prior on model space is of utmost importance, almost overshadowing the other parts of the clustering problem, and we examine the behavior of the model posterior probabilities based on different model space priors. We find, somewhat surprisingly, that procedures based on the often-used uniform prior (in which all models are given the same prior probability) lead to inconsistent model selection procedures. We examine other priors, and find that the Ewens-Pitman prior and a new prior, the hierarchical uniform prior, lead to consistent model selection procedures and have other desirable properties. Lastly, we compare the procedures on a range of examples.","Bayesian model selection,Consistency,Hierarchical models,Intrinsic priors,Product partition models,Stochastic search",,"Casella, George@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA::Moreno, Elias@Univ Granada, Dept Stat, E-18071 Granada, Spain::Javier Giron, F.@Univ Malaga, Dept Stat, E-29071 Malaga, Spain","Casella, George@State University System of Florida@University of Florida::Moreno, Elias@University of Granada::Javier Giron, F.@Universidad de Malaga",not exist,
The Performance of Covariance Selection Methods That Consider Decomposable Models Only,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/14-BA874,2014,17,4,"We consider the behavior of Bayesian procedures that perform model selection for decomposable Gaussian graphical models when the true model is in fact non-decomposable. We examine the asymptotic behavior of the posterior when models are misspecified in this way, and find that the posterior will converge to graphical structures that are minimal triangulations of the true structure. The marginal log likelihood ratio comparing different minimal triangulations is stochastically bounded, and appears to remain data dependent regardless of the sample size. The covariance matrices corresponding to the different minimal triangulations are essentially equivalent, so model averaging is of minimal benefit. Using simulated data sets and a particular high performing Bayesian method for fitting decomposable models, feature inclusion stochastic search, we illustrate that these predictions are borne out in practice. Finally, a comparison is made to penalized likelihood methods for graphical models, which make no decomposability restriction. Despite its inability to fit the true model, feature inclusion stochastic search produces models that are competitive or superior to the penalized likelihood methods, especially at higher dimensions.","undirected Gaussian graphical models,covariance selection,feature inclusion stochastic search,decomposable,non-decomposable,graphical lasso,asymptotic behavior","GAUSSIAN GRAPHICAL MODELS,BAYESIAN-INFERENCE,LASSO","Fitch, A.

Toward Rational Social Decisions: A Review and Some Results,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/14-BA876,2014,18,0,"Bayesian decision theory is profoundly personalistic. It prescribes the decision d that minimizes the expectation of the decision-maker's loss function L(d, theta) with respect to that person's opinion 7(0). Attempts to extend this paradigm to more than one decision-maker have generally been unsuccessful, as shown in Part A of this paper. Part B of this paper explores a different decision set-up, in which Bayesians make choices knowing that later Bayesians will make decisions that matter to the earlier Bayesians. We explore conditions under which they together can be modeled as a single Bayesian. There are three reasons for doing so:

1. To understand the common structure of various examples, in some of which the reduction to a single Bayesian is possible, and in some of which it is not. In particular, it helps to deepen our understanding of the desirability of randomization to Bayesians.

2. As a possible computational simplification. When such reduction is possible, standard expected loss minimization software can be used to find optimal actions.

3. As a start toward a better understanding of social decision-making.","social decisions,compromise,randomization","SUBJECTIVE-PROBABILITY,PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES,BAYESIAN PLAYERS,GAMES","Kadane, Joseph B.@Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Stat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA::MacEachern, Steven N.@Ohio State Univ, Dept Stat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Kadane, Joseph B.@Carnegie Mellon University::MacEachern, Steven N.@Ohio State University","MacEachern, Steve@C-5299-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4106-1232","Optimal Bayesian randomization+Berry, SM; Kadane, JB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1997::Foresight: its logical laws, its subjective sources+de Finetti, B.+STUDIES SUBJECTIVE P+1937::OPTIMAL CHALLENGES FOR SELECTION+DEGROOT, MH; KADANE, JB+OPERATIONS RESEARCH+1980::OPTIMAL EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGN FOR ANOTHERS ANALYSIS+ETZIONI, R; KADANE, JB+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1993::Games with incomplete information played by Bayesian players, Parts I, L, and III.+Harsanyi, J.

In this way, our model accounts for potential learning effects in addition to other mechanisms of temporal drift in task-related signals.

Bayesian Multiscale Smoothing of Gaussian Noised Images,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/14-BA871,2014,25,1,"We propose a multiscale model for Gaussian noised images under a Bayesian framework for both 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) images. We use a Chinese restaurant process prior to randomly generate ties among intensity values at neighboring pixels in the image. The resulting Bayesian estimator enjoys some desirable asymptotic properties for identifying precise structures in the image. The proposed Bayesian denoising procedure is completely data-driven. A conditional conjugacy property allows analytical computation of the posterior distribution without involving Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, making the method computationally efficient. Simulations on Shepp-Logan phantom and Lena test images confirm that our smoothing method is comparable with the best available methods for light noise and outperforms them for heavier noise both visually and numerically. The proposed method is further extended for 3D images. A simulation study shows that the proposed method is numerically better than most existing denoising approaches for 3D images. A 3D Shepp-Logan phantom image is used to demonstrate the visual and numerical performance of the proposed method, along with the computational time. MATLAB toolboxes are made available online (both 2D and 3D) to implement the proposed method and reproduce the numerical results.","Chinese Restaurant Process,MCMC-free computation,3-dimensional image",EDGES,"Li, Meng@N Carolina State Univ, Dept Stat, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA::Ghosal, Subhashis@N Carolina State Univ, Dept Stat, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Li, Meng@North Carolina State University@University of North Carolina::Ghosal, Subhashis@North Carolina State University@University of North Carolina","Li, Meng@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2123-2444","An error metric for binary images.

Matrix-Variate Dirichlet Process Priors with Applications,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/13-BA853,2014,44,1,"In this paper we propose a matrix-variate Dirichlet process (MATDP) for modeling the joint prior of a set of random matrices. Our approach is able to share statistical strength among regression coefficient matrices due to the clustering property of the Dirichlet process. Moreover, since the base probability measure is defined as a matrix-variate distribution, the dependence among the elements of each random matrix is described via the matrix-variate distribution. We apply MATDP to multivariate supervised learning problems. In particular, we devise a nonparametric discriminative model and a nonparametric latent factor model. The interest is in considering correlations both across response variables (or covariates) and across response vectors. We derive Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for posterior inference and prediction, and illustrate the application of the models to multivariate regression, multi-class classification and multi-label prediction problems.","Dirichlet processes,nonparametric dependent modeling,matrix-variate distributions,nonparametric discriminative analysis,latent factor regression","BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS,NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS,REGRESSION,MIXTURES,CLASSIFICATION,DISTRIBUTIONS,BINARY,MODELS","Zhang, Zhihua@Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, MOE Microsoft Key Lab Intelligent Comp & Intellig, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China::Wang, Dakan@Twitter Inc, San Francisco, CA USA::Dai, Guang@Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China::Jordan, Michael I.@Univ Calif Berkeley, Div Comp Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA@Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Stat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Zhang, Zhihua@Microsoft@Shanghai Jiao Tong University::Wang, Dakan@Unknow::Dai, Guang@Shanghai Jiao Tong University::Jordan, Michael I.@University of California System@University of California Berkeley",not exist,"BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS OF BINARY AND POLYCHOTOMOUS RESPONSE DATA+ALBERT, JH; CHIB, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1993::Time-Series Similarity Queries Employing a Feature-Based Approach+Alcock, R.

Bayesian Sequential Experimental Design for Binary Response data with Application to Electromyographic Experiments,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/13-BA855,2014,30,2,"We develop a sequential Monte Carlo approach for Bayesian analysis of the experimental design for binary response data. Our work is motivated by surface electromyographic (SEMG) experiments, which can be used to provide information about the functionality of subjects' motor units. These experiments involve a series of stimuli being applied to a motor unit, with whether or not the motor unit fires for each stimulus being recorded. The aim is to learn about how the probability of firing depends on the applied stimulus (the so-called stimulus-response curve). One such excitability parameter is an estimate of the stimulus level for which the motor unit has a 50% chance of firing. Within such an experiment we are able to choose the next stimulus level based on the past observations. We show how sequential Monte Carlo can be used to analyse such data in an online manner. We then use the current estimate of the posterior distribution in order to choose the next stimulus level. The aim is to select a stimulus level that mimimises the expected loss of estimating a quantity, or quantities, of interest. We will apply this loss function to the estimates of target quantiles from the stimulus-response curve. Through simulation we show that this approach is more efficient than existing sequential design methods in terms of estimating the quantile(s) of interest. If applied in practice, it could reduce the length of SEMG experiments by a factor of three.","Bayesian design,sequential design,motor unit,particle filtering,generalized linear model,binary response",MONTE-CARLO,"Azadi, Nammam Ali@Kurdistan Univ Med Sci, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Sanandaj, Iran@Univ Lancaster, Dept Math & Stat, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England::Fearnhead, Paul@Univ Lancaster, Dept Math & Stat, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England::Ridall, Gareth@Univ Lancaster, Dept Math & Stat, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England::Blok, Joleen H.@Univ Med Ctr Rotterdam, Dept Clin Neurophysiol, Rotterdam, Netherlands","Azadi, Nammam Ali@Lancaster University@Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences::Fearnhead, Paul@Lancaster University::Ridall, Gareth@Lancaster University::Blok, Joleen H.@Erasmus University Rotterdam","Fearnhead, Paul@A-5938-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9386-2341::Azadi, Nammam@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7983-6318::Blok, Joleen@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9661-5816","Modeling the excitability behaviour ol a single motor unit and experimental design for the surface EMG test+Azadi, N.

Local-Mass Preserving Prior Distributions for Nonparametric Bayesian Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/13-BA857,2014,35,2,"We address the problem of prior specification for models involving the two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet process. These models are sometimes partially subjectively specified and are always partially (or fully) specified by a rule. We develop prior distributions based on local mass preservation. The robustness of posterior inference to an arbitrary choice of overdispersion under the proposed and current priors is investigated. Two examples are provided to demonstrate the properties of the proposed priors. We focus on the three major types of inference: clustering of the parameters of interest, estimation and prediction. The new priors are found to provide more stable inference about clustering than traditional priors while showing few drawbacks. Furthermore, it is shown that more stable clustering results in more stable inference for estimation and prediction. We recommend the local-mass preserving priors as a replacement for the traditional priors.","nonparametric Bayes,Dirichlet process,two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet process,local mass,prior misspecification,clustering","POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTIONS,MIXTURES,INFERENCE,CONVERGENCE,DENSITY,RATES","Lee, Juhee@Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Appl Math & Stat, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA::MacEachern, Steven N.@Ohio State Univ, Dept Stat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA::Lu, Yiling@UT MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Syst Biol, Houston, TX USA::Mills, Gordon B.@UT MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Syst Biol, Houston, TX USA","Lee, Juhee@University of California Santa Cruz@University of California System::MacEachern, Steven N.@Ohio State University::Lu, Yiling@UTMD Anderson Cancer Center@University of Texas System::Mills, Gordon B.@UTMD Anderson Cancer Center@University of Texas System","MacEachern, Steve@C-5299-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4106-1232","MIXTURES OF DIRICHLET PROCESSES WITH APPLICATIONS TO BAYESIAN NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS+ANTONIAK, CE+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1974::no title+Berger, J.

Bayesian Analysis of the Functional-Coefficient Autoregressive Heteroscedastic Model,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/14-BA865,2014,45,1,"In this paper, we propose a new model called the functional-coefficient autoregressive heteroscedastic (FARCH) model for nonlinear time series. The FARCH model extends the existing functional-coefficient autoregressive models and double-threshold autoregressive heteroscedastic models by providing a flexible framework for the detection of nonlinear features for both the conditional mean and conditional variance. We propose a Bayesian approach, along with the Bayesian P-splines technique and Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, to estimate the functional coefficients and unknown parameters of the model. We also conduct model comparison via the Bayes factor. The performance of the proposed methodology is evaluated via a simulation study.

Bayesian Adaptive Smoothing Splines using Stochastic Differential Equations,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/13-BA866,2014,41,4,"The smoothing spline is one of the most popular curve-fitting methods, partly because of empirical evidence supporting its effectiveness and partly because of its elegant mathematical formulation. However, there are two obstacles that restrict the use of the smoothing spline in practical statistical work. Firstly, it becomes computationally prohibitive for large data sets because the number of basis functions roughly equals the sample size. Secondly, its global smoothing parameter can only provide a constant amount of smoothing, which often results in poor performances when estimating inhomogeneous functions. In this work, we introduce a class of adaptive smoothing spline models that is derived by solving certain stochastic differential equations with finite element methods. The solution extends the smoothing parameter to a continuous data-driven function, which is able to capture the change of the smoothness of the underlying process. The new model is Markovian, which makes Bayesian computation fast. A simulation study and real data example are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.","Adaptive smoothing,Markov chain Monte Carlo,Smoothing spline,Stochastic differential equation","MARKOV RANDOM-FIELDS,P-SPLINES,PENALIZED SPLINES,REGRESSION,MODELS,INFERENCE,PRIORS,PENALTIES,ERRORS","Yue, Yu Ryan@CUNY Bernard M Baruch Coll, New York, NY 10010 USA::Simpson, Daniel@Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Trondheim, Norway::Lindgren, Finn@Univ Bath, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England::Rue, Havard@Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Trondheim, Norway","Yue, Yu Ryan@City University of New York (CUNY) System@Baruch College (CUNY)::Simpson, Daniel@Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU)@Norwegian University of Science & Technology::Lindgren, Finn@University of Bath::Rue, Havard@Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU)@Norwegian University of Science & Technology","Lindgren, Finn@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5833-2011","Improved inference in nonparametric regression using L(k)-smoothing splines+Abramovich, F; Steinberg, DM+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+FEB 1 1996::Spatially adaptive Bayesian penalized regression splines (P-splines)+Baladandayuthapani, V; Mallick, BK; Carroll, RJ+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+JUN 2005::Generalized structured additive regression based on Bayesian P-splines+Brezger, A; Lang, S+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+FEB 24 2006::Spatially adaptive Bayesian penalized splines with heteroscedastic errors+Crainiceanu, Ciprian M.; Ruppert, David; Carroll, Raymond J.; et al.+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+JUN 2007::Confidence intervals for nonparametric curve estimates: Toward more uniform pointwise coverage+Cummins, DJ; Filloon, TG; Nychka, D+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2001::Spline minimizing rotation-invariant seminorms in Sobolev spaces+Duchon, J.+Constractive Theory of Functions of Several Variables+1977::Splines, knots, and penalties+Eilers, Paul H.

Laplace Approximation for Logistic Gaussian Process Density Estimation and Regression,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/14-BA872,2014,37,5,"Logistic Gaussian process (LGP) priors provide a flexible alternative for modelling unknown densities. The smoothness properties of the density estimates can be controlled through the prior covariance structure of the LGP, but the challenge is the analytically intractable inference. In this paper, we present approximate Bayesian inference for LGP density estimation in a grid using Laplace's method to integrate over the non-Gaussian posterior distribution of latent function values and to determine the covariance function parameters with type-II maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. We demonstrate that Laplace's method with MAP is sufficiently fast for practical interactive visualisation of 1D and 2D densities. Our experiments with simulated and real 1D data sets show that the estimation accuracy is close to a Markov chain Monte Carlo approximation and state-of-the-art hierarchical in finite Gaussian mixture models. We also construct a reduced-rank approximation to speed up the computations for dense 2D grids, and demonstrate density regression with the proposed Laplace approach.","Gaussian process,logistic transformation,density estimation,density regression,approximate inference,Laplace's method","PROCESS PRIORS,PROCESS CLASSIFICATION,BAYESIAN-INFERENCE,MODELS,LIKELIHOOD","Riihimaki, Jaakko@Aalto Univ, BECS, Espoo, Finland::Vehtari, Aki@Aalto Univ, BECS, Espoo, Finland","Riihimaki, Jaakko@Aalto University::Vehtari, Aki@Aalto University","Vehtari, Aki@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2164-9469","The Gaussian process density sampler+Adams, R.; Murray, I.; MacKay, D.+ADV NEURAL INFORM PR+2009::Kernel Methods for Nonparametric Bayesian Inference of Probabilities and Point Processes.+Adams, R.

Bayesian Regularization via Graph Laplacian,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/14-BA860,2014,36,5,"Regularization plays a critical role in modern statistical research, especially in high-dimensional variable selection problems. Existing Bayesian methods usually assume independence between variables a priori. In this article, we propose a novel Bayesian approach, which explicitly models the dependence structure through a graph Laplacian matrix. We also generalize the graph Laplacian to allow both positively and negatively correlated variables. A prior distribution for the graph Laplacian is then proposed, which allows conjugacy and thereby greatly simplifies the computation. We show that the proposed Bayesian model leads to proper posterior distribution. Connection is made between our method and some existing regularization methods, such as Elastic Net, Lasso, Octagonal Shrinkage and Clustering Algorithm for Regression (OSCAR) and Ridge regression. An efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo method based on parameter augmentation is developed for posterior computation. Finally, we demonstrate the method through several simulation studies and an application on a real data set involving key performance indicators of electronics companies.","Bayesian analysis,Elastic Net,Grouping,Lasso,OSCAR,Regularization,Ridge regression,Variable selection","VARIABLE SELECTION,ELASTIC NET,REGRESSION SHRINKAGE,STRATEGIES,PREDICTORS,GENOMICS,SPACES,LASSO","Liu, Fei@CUNY Queens Coll, Flushing, NY 11367 USA::Chakraborty, Sounak@Univ Missouri, Dept Stat, Columbia, MO 65211 USA::Li, Fan@Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC USA::Liu, Yan@Univ So Calif, Dept Comp Sci, Los Angeles, CA USA::Lozano, Aurelie C.@Unknow","Liu, Fei@Queens College NY (CUNY)@City University of New York (CUNY) System::Chakraborty, Sounak@University of Missouri Columbia@University of Missouri System::Li, Fan@Duke University::Liu, Yan@University of Southern California::Lozano, Aurelie C.@Unknow",not exist,"Simultaneous regression shrinkage, variable selection, and supervised clustering of predictors with OSCAR+Bondell, Howard D.; Reich, Brian J.+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2008::Grouping Priors and the Bayesian Elastic Net+Bornn, L.; Gottardo, R.; Doucet, A.+Technical Report 254+2010::A Bayesian hybrid Huberized support vector machine and its applications in high-dimensional medical data+Chakraborty, Sounak; Guo, Ruixin+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+MAR 1 2011::Bayesian variable selection with related predictors+Chipman, H+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+MAR 1996::Multiple shrinkage and subset selection in wavelets+Clyde, M; Parmigiani, G; Vidakovic, B+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1998::On Sampling Strategies in Bayesian Variable Selection Problems With Large Model Spaces+Garcia-Donato, G.; Martinez-Beneito, M.

Adaptive Bayesian Density Estimation in L-p-metrics with Pitman-Yor or Normalized Inverse-Gaussian Process Kernel Mixtures,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/14-BA863,2014,43,12,"We consider Bayesian nonparametric density estimation using a Pitman-Yor or a normalized inverse-Gaussian process convolution kernel mixture as the prior distribution for a density. The procedure is studied from a frequentist perspective. Using the stick-breaking representation of the Pitman-Yor process and the finite-dimensional distributions of the normalized inverse-Gaussian process, we prove that, when the data are independent replicates from a density with analytic or Sobolev smoothness, the posterior distribution concentrates on shrinking L-p-norm balls around the sampling density at a minimax-optimal rate, up to a logarithmic factor. The resulting hierarchical Bayesian procedure, with a fixed prior, is adaptive to the unknown smoothness of the sampling density.","adaptation,nonparametric density estimation,normalized inverse-Gaussian process,Pitman-Yor process,posterior contraction rate,sinc kernel","CONVERGENCE-RATES,DIRICHLET MIXTURES,POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTIONS,PRIORS,DECONVOLUTION,LIKELIHOOD,MODELS","Scricciolo, Catia@Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy","Scricciolo, Catia@Bocconi University",not exist,"no title+Abramowitz, M.; Stegun, I.

Inference in Two-Piece Location-Scale Models with Jeffreys Priors,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/13-BA849,2014,34,18,"This paper addresses the use of Jeffreys priors in the context of univariate three-parameter location-scale models, where skewness is introduced by differing scale parameters either side of the location. We focus on various commonly used parameterizations for these models. Jeffreys priors are shown to lead to improper posteriors in the wide and practically relevant class of distributions obtained by skewing scale mixtures of normals. Easily checked conditions under which independence Jeffreys priors can be used for valid inference are derived. We also investigate two alternative priors, one of which is shown to lead to valid Bayesian inference for all practically interesting parameterizations of these models and is our recommendation to practitioners. We illustrate some of these models using real data.","Bayesian inference,noninformative prior,posterior existence,scale mixtures of normals,skewness","SKEW-NORMAL DISTRIBUTION,PARAMETER ORTHOGONALITY,BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS,DISTRIBUTIONS","Rubio, Francisco J.@Univ Warwick, Dept Stat, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England::Steel, Mark F.

Chain Event Graphs for Informed Missingness,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/13-BA843,2014,18,5,"Chain Event Graphs (CEGs) are proving to be a useful framework for modelling discrete processes which exhibit strong asymmetric dependence structures between the variables of the problem. In this paper we exploit this framework to represent processes where missingness is influential and data cannot plausibly be hypothesised to be missing at random in all situations. We develop new classes of models where data are missing not at random but nevertheless exhibit context-specific symmetries which are captured by the CEG. We show that it is possible to score each model efficiently and in closed form. Hence standard Bayesian selection methods can be used to search over a wide variety of models, each with its own explanatory narrative. One of the advantages of this method is that the selected maximum a posteriori model and other closely scoring models can be easily read back to the client in a graphically transparent way. The efficacy of our methods are illustrated using a cerebral palsy cohort study, analysing their survival with respect to weight at birth and various disabilities.","Chain Event Graphs,Ordinal Chain Event Graphs,Bayesian Model Selection,Missing Data,Missing Not at Random",CEREBRAL-PALSY,"Barclay, Lorna M.@Univ Warwick, Dept Stat, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England::Hutton, Jane L.@Univ Warwick, Dept Stat, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England::Smith, Jim Q.@Univ Warwick, Dept Stat, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England","Barclay, Lorna M.@University of Warwick::Hutton, Jane L.@University of Warwick::Smith, Jim Q.@University of Warwick",not exist,"The impact of dropouts on the analysis of dose-finding studies with recurrent event data+Akacha, Mouna; Benda, Norbert+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUL 10 2010::Refining a Bayesian Network using a Chain Event Graph+Barclay, L.

Bayes Linear Sufficiency in Non-exchangeable Multivariate Multiple Regressions,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/13-BA847,2014,27,0,"We consider sufficiency for Bayes linear revision for multivariate multiple regression problems, and in particular where we have a sequence of multivariate observations at different matrix design points, but with common parameter vector. Such sequences are not usually exchangeable. However, we show that there is a sequence of transformed observations which is exchangeable and we demonstrate that their mean is sufficient both for Bayes linear revision of the parameter vector and for prediction of future observations. We link these ideas to making revisions of belief over replicated structure such as graphical templates of model relationships. We show that the sufficiencies lead to natural residual collections and thence to sequential diagnostic assessments. We show how each finite regression problem corresponds to a parallel implied infinite exchangeable sequence which may be exploited to solve the sample-size design problem. Bayes linear methods are based on limited specifications of belief, usually means, variances, and covariances. As such, the methodology is well suited to high-dimensional regression problems where a full Bayesian analysis is difficult or impossible, but where a linear Bayes approach offers a pragmatic way to combine judgements with data in order to produce posterior summaries.","Bayes linear,Sufficient,Multivariate multiple regression,Approximate Bayesian,Residual space,Diagnostics,Sequential,Sample-size design","COMPUTATION,SYSTEMS,MODELS","Wooff, David A.@Univ Durham, Durham DH1 3HP, England","Wooff, David A.@Durham University","Wooff, David@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4948-0132","AN INVERSE MATRIX ADJUSTMENT ARISING IN DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS+BARTLETT, MS+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1951::A Comparative Review of Dimension Reduction Methods in Approximate Bayesian Computation+Blum, M.

Zero Variance Differential Geometric Markov Chain Monte Carlo Algorithms,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/13-BA848,2014,41,6,"Differential geometric Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) strategies exploit the geometry of the target to achieve convergence in fewer MCMC iterations at the cost of increased computing time for each of the iterations. Such computational complexity is regarded as a potential shortcoming of geometric MCMC in practice. This paper suggests that part of the additional computing required by Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithms produces elements that allow concurrent implementation of the zero variance reduction technique for MCMC estimation. Therefore, zero variance geometric MCMC emerges as an inherently unified sampling scheme, in the sense that variance reduction and geometric exploitation of the parameter space can be performed simultaneously without exceeding the computational requirements posed by the geometric MCMC scheme alone. A MATLAB package is provided, which implements a generic code framework of the combined methodology for a range of models.","Metropolis-Hastings,Hamiltonian Monte Carlo,Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithms,Control variates","METROPOLIS-HASTINGS ALGORITHM,DENSITIES,SAMPLERS,MCMC","Papamarkou, Theodore@UCL, Dept Stat Sci, London, England::Mira, Antonietta@Univ Lugano, Swiss Finance Inst, Lugano, Switzerland::Girolami, Mark@UCL, Dept Stat Sci, London, England","Papamarkou, Theodore@University of London@University College London::Mira, Antonietta@University of Lugano::Girolami, Mark@University of London@University College London","Papamarkou, Theodore@A-2958-2012","OVER-RELAXATION METHOD FOR THE MONTE-CARLO EVALUATION OF THE PARTITION-FUNCTION FOR MULTIQUADRATIC ACTIONS+ADLER, SL+PHYSICAL REVIEW D+1981::BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS OF BINARY AND POLYCHOTOMOUS RESPONSE DATA+ALBERT, JH; CHIB, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1993::Variance reduction through smoothing and control variates for Markov chain simulations+Andradottir, S.; Heyman, D.P.; Ott, T.J.+ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation+July 1993::Zero-variance principle for Monte Carlo algorithms+Assaraf, R; Caffarel, M+PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS+DEC 6 1999::Improving on the independent Metropolis-Hastings algorithm+Atchade, YF; Perron, F+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 2005::Improving stochastic relaxation for Gussian random fields+Barone, P.; Frigessi, A.+Probab.

A Bayesian Nonparametric Approach for Time Series Clustering,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/13-BA852,2014,37,14,"In this work we propose a model-based clustering method for time series. The model uses an almost surely discrete Bayesian nonparametric prior to induce clustering of the series. Specifically we propose a general Poisson-Dirichlet process mixture model, which includes the Dirichlet process mixture model as a particular case. The model accounts for typical features present in a time series like trends, seasonal and temporal components. All or only part of these features can be used for clustering according to the user. Posterior inference is obtained via an easy to implement Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) scheme. The best cluster is chosen according to a heterogeneity measure as well as the model selection criterion LPML (logarithm of the pseudo marginal likelihood). We illustrate our approach with a dataset of time series of share prices in the Mexican stock exchange.","Bayes nonparametrics,dynamic linear model,model-based clustering,Pitman-Yor process,time series analysis","CHAIN MONTE-CARLO,STATE-SPACE MODELS,SAMPLING METHODS,MIXTURE-MODELS,DISTRIBUTIONS,INFERENCE,SELECTION","Nieto-Barajas, Luis E.@ITAM, Dept Stat, Mexico City, DF, Mexico::Contreras-Cristan, Alberto@IIMAS UNAM, Dept Probabil & Stat, Mexico City, DF, Mexico","Nieto-Barajas, Luis E.@Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico::Contreras-Cristan, Alberto@Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico",not exist,"A Bayesian nonparametric mixture model for cluster analysis+Argiento, R.; Cremaschi, A.; Guglielmi, A.+Technical report Quaderno Imati CNR, 2012 3-MI+2013::no title+Campbell, J.; Lo, A.; MacKinlay, A.+The Econometrics of Financial Markets+1997::A MONTE-CARLO APPROACH TO NONNORMAL AND NONLINEAR STATE-SPACE MODELING+CARLIN, BP; POLSON, NG; STOFFER, DS+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1992::Bayesian inference for linear dynamic models with Dirichlet process mixtures+Caron, Francois; Davy, Manuel; Doucet, Arnaud; et al.+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING+JAN 2008::Markov chain Monte Carlo in conditionally Gaussian state space models+Carter, CK; Kohn, R+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1996::ON GIBBS SAMPLING FOR STATE-SPACE MODELS+CARTER, CK; KOHN, R+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1994::no title+Chatfield, C.+ANAL TIME SERIES INT+1989::Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation methods in econometrics+Chib, S; Greenberg, E+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+AUG 1996::Bayesian Inference for Gene Expression and Proteomics+no author+BAYESIAN INFERENCE FOR GENE EXPRESSION AND PROTEOMICS+2006::Computing Nonparametric Hierarchical Models+Escobar, M.

Regularized Bayesian Estimation of Generalized Threshold Regression Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/13-BA850,2014,31,2,"In this article we discuss estimation of generalized threshold regression models in settings when the threshold parameter lacks identifiability. In particular, if estimation of the regression coefficients is associated with high uncertainty and/or the difference between regimes is small, estimators of the threshold and, hence, of the whole model can be strongly affected. A new regularized Bayesian estimator for generalized threshold regression models is proposed. We derive conditions for superiority of the new estimator over the standard likelihood one in terms of mean squared error. Simulations confirm excellent finite sample properties of the suggested estimator, especially in the critical settings. The practical relevance of our approach is illustrated by two real-data examples already analyzed in the literature.","empirical Bayes,regularization,threshold identification","LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,CHANGE-POINT,TIME-SERIES,AUTOREGRESSION,INFERENCE","Greb, Friederike@Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany@Univ Gottingen, Courant Res Ctr Poverty Equ & Growth Dev Countrie, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany::Krivobokova, Tatyana@Univ Gottingen, Courant Res Ctr Poverty Equ & Growth Dev Countrie, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany@Univ Gottingen, Inst Math Stochast, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany::Munk, Axel@Univ Gottingen, Inst Math Stochast, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany@Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany::von Cramon-Taubadel, Stephan@Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Greb, Friederike@University of Gottingen::Krivobokova, Tatyana@University of Gottingen::Munk, Axel@University of Gottingen@Max Planck Society::von Cramon-Taubadel, Stephan@University of Gottingen",not exist,"TESTS FOR PARAMETER INSTABILITY AND STRUCTURAL-CHANGE WITH UNKNOWN CHANGE-POINT+ANDREWS, DWK+ECONOMETRICA+JUL 1993::ESTIMATING TRANSITION BETWEEN 2 INTERSECTING STRAIGHT LINES+BACON, DW; WATTS, DG+BIOMETRIKA+1971::Estimation of a change point in multiple regression models+Bai, J+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+NOV 1997::no title+Breiman, L; Friedman, J; Stone, CJ<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Olshen, RA</span>.+Classification and regression trees+1984::APPROXIMATE INFERENCE IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS+BRESLOW, NE; CLAYTON, DG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::Limiting properties of the least squares estimator of a continuous threshold autoregressive model+Chan, KS; Tsay, RS+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1998::On parameter estimation of threshold autoregressive models+Chan, N.

Objective Prior for the Number of Degrees of Freedom of a t Distribution,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/13-BA854,2014,22,10,"In this paper, we construct an objective prior for the degrees of freedom of a t distribution, when the parameter is taken to be discrete. This parameter is typically problematic to estimate and a problem in objective Bayesian inference since improper priors lead to improper posteriors, whilst proper priors may dominate the data likelihood. We find an objective criterion, based on loss functions, instead of trying to define objective probabilities directly. Truncating the prior on the degrees of freedom is necessary, as the t distribution, above a certain number of degrees of freedom, becomes the normal distribution. The defined prior is tested in simulation scenarios, including linear regression with t-distributed errors, and on real data: the daily returns of the closing Dow Jones index over a period of 98 days.","Objective prior,t distribution,Kullback-Leibler divergence,Linear regression,Self-information loss function,Robust analysis,Financial return","BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS,LINEAR-REGRESSION,MODELS,ERRORS","Villa, Cristiano@Univ Kent, Sch Math Stat & Actuarial Sci, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England::Walker, Stephen G.@Univ Texas Austin, Dept Math, Austin, TX 78712 USA@Univ Texas Austin, Div Stat & Sci Computat, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Villa, Cristiano@University of Kent::Walker, Stephen G.@University of Texas Austin@University of Texas System","Villa, Cristiano@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2670-2954","TOPICS IN INVESTIGATION OF LINEAR RELATIONS FITTED BY METHOD OF LEAST SQUARES+ANSCOMBE, FJ+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1967::no title+Berger,, J.+Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis+1985::Objective Priors for Discrete Parameter Spaces+Berger, James O.; Bernardo, Jose M.; Sun, Dongchu+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2012::LIMITING BEHAVIOR OF POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTIONS WHEN MODEL IS INCORRECT+BERK, RH+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1966::LOCAL DIVERGENCE AND ASSOCIATION+BLYTH, S+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1994::Bayesian Priors from Loss Matching+Brown, Philip J.; Walker, Stephen G.+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+APR 2012::ERRORS IN NORMAL APPROXIMATIONS TO THE TERT,TAU, AND SIMILAR TYPES OF DISTRIBUTION+CHU, JT+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1956::Intrinsic priors via Kullback-Leibler geometry+Dmochowski, J.+Bayesian Stat+1996::no title+Fabozzi, FJ; Focardi, SM; Hochostotter, M<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Rachev, ST</span>.+Probability and statistics for finance+2010::Multivariate student-t regression models: Pitfalls and inference+Fernandez, C; Steel, MFJ+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1999::Objective Bayesian analysis for the Student-t regression model+Fonseca, Thais C.

Incorporating Grouping Information in Bayesian Variable Selection with Applications in Genomics,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/13-BA846,2014,47,7,"In many applications it is of interest to determine a limited number of important explanatory factors (representing groups of potentially overlapping predictors) rather than original predictor variables. The often imposed requirement that the clustered predictors should enter the model simultaneously may be limiting as not all the variables within a group need to be associated with the outcome. Within-group sparsity is often desirable as well. Here we propose a Bayesian variable selection method, which uses the grouping information as a means of introducing more equal competition to enter the model within the groups rather than as a source of strict regularization constraints. This is achieved within the context of Bayesian LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) by allowing each regression coefficient to be penalized differentially and by considering an additional regression layer to relate individual penalty parameters to a group identification matrix. The proposed hierarchical model therefore enables inference simultaneously on two levels: (1) the regression layer for the continuous outcome in relation to the predictors and (2) the regression layer for the penalty parameters in relation to the grouping information. Both situations with overlapping and non-overlapping groups are applicable. The method does not assume within-group homogeneity across the regression coefficients, which is implicit in many structured penalized likelihood approaches. The smoothness here is enforced at the penalty level rather than within the regression coefficients. To enhance the potential of the proposed method we develop two rapid computational procedures based on the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, which offer substantial time savings in applications where the high-dimensionality renders Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches less practical. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method in predicting time to death in glioblastoma patients using pathways of genes.","Bayesian shrinkage estimation,EM algorithm,Bayesian LASSO,Minorization-maximization","NONCONCAVE PENALIZED LIKELIHOOD,ORACLE PROPERTIES,MODEL SELECTION,MICROARRAY DATA,EM ALGORITHM,REGRESSION,NETWORK,LASSO,REGULARIZATION,EXPRESSION","Rockova, Veronika@Erasmus Univ, Dept Biostat, Erasmus MC, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands::Lesaffre, Emmanuel@Erasmus Univ, Dept Biostat, Erasmus MC, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands@Katholieke Univ Leuven, L BioStat, Louvain, Belgium","Rockova, Veronika@Erasmus University Rotterdam::Lesaffre, Emmanuel@KU Leuven@Erasmus University Rotterdam",not exist,"no title+Abramowitz, M; Stegun, I A.+HDB MATH FUNCTIONS+1972::Generalized Double Pareto Shrinkage+Armagan, A.; Dunson, D.; Lee, J.+Technical report+2012::The horseshoe estimator for sparse signals+Carvalho, Carlos M.; Polson, Nicholas G.; Scott, James G.+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 2010::High-Dimensional Sparse Factor Modeling: Applications in Gene Expression Genomics+Carvalho, Carlos M.; Chang, Jeffrey; Lucas, Joseph E.; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2008::Conjugate priors for generalized linear models+Chen, MH; Ibrahim, JG+STATISTICA SINICA+APR 2003::Analysis of the phosphatidylinositol 3 '-kinase signaling pathway in glioblastoma patients in Vivo+Choe, G; Horvath, S; Cloughesy, TF; et al.+CANCER RESEARCH+JUN 1 2003::Epigenetic inactivation of SLIT3 and SLIT1 genes in human cancers+Dallol, A.; Bieche, I.; Krex, D.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Morton, D.; Maher, E.; Latif, F.; Dickinson, R</span>.+British Journal of Cancer+2004::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::Nonconcave penalized likelihood with a diverging number of parameters+Fan, JQ; Peng, H+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2004::Variable selection via nonconcave penalized likelihood and its oracle properties+Fan, JQ; Li, RZ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2001::Adaptive sparseness for supervised learning+Figueiredo, MAT+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE+SEP 2003::Proper multivariate conditional autoregressive models for spatial data analysis+Gelfand, AE; Vounatsou, P+BIOSTATISTICS+JAN 2003::Calibration and Empirical Bayes Variable Selection+George, E.; Foster, D.+Biometrika+1997::COMPARISON OF CELL-ADHESION MOLECULE EXPRESSION BETWEEN GLIOBLASTOMA-MULTIFORME AND AUTOLOGOUS NORMAL BRAIN-TISSUE+GINGRAS, MC; ROUSSEL, E; BRUNER, JM; et al.+JOURNAL OF NEUROIMMUNOLOGY+MAR 1995::no title+Golub, G.H.; Loan, C.V.+Matrix Computations+1996::no title+Gradshteyn, I.

The performance of the model selection procedure is also compared to popular penalized likelihood methods. Coupling diagnostics are used to bound the total variation distance between iterates in an Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm and the posterior distribution on the model space. In several simulation scenarios in which the number of observations exceeds 100, rapid convergence and high accuracy of the Bayesian procedure is demonstrated. Conversely, the coupling diagnostics are successful in diagnosing lack of convergence in several scenarios for which the number of observations is less than 100. The accuracy of the Bayesian model selection procedure in identifying high probability models is shown to be comparable to commonly used penalized likelihood methods, including extensions of smoothly clipped absolute deviations (SCAD) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) procedures.","MCMC algorithm,convergence diagnostic,coupling,SCAD,sure independence screening,penalized likelihood,variable selection","MONTE-CARLO ALGORITHMS,VARIABLE-SELECTION,FEATURE SPACE,CONVERGENCE","Johnson, Valen E.@Texas A&M Univ, Dept Stat, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Johnson, Valen E.@Texas A&M University College Station@Texas A&M University System",not exist,"Sure independence screening for ultrahigh dimensional feature space+Fan, Jianqing; Lv, Jinchi+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+NOV 2008::A SELECTIVE OVERVIEW OF VARIABLE SELECTION IN HIGH DIMENSIONAL FEATURE SPACE+Fan, Jianqing; Lv, Jinchi+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 2010::Inference from iterative simulation using multiple sequences+Gelman, A; Rubin, DB.+Stat Sci+1992::Bayesian Model Selection in High-Dimensional Settings+Johnson, Valen E.; Rossell, David+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2012::A coupling-regeneration scheme for diagnosing convergence in Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms+Johnson, VE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1998::Studying convergence of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms using coupled sample paths+Johnson, VE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1996::no title+Lindvall, T.+Lecture on the coupling method+1992::BAYES AND EMPIRICAL-BAYES MULTIPLICITY ADJUSTMENT IN THE VARIABLE-SELECTION PROBLEM+Scott, James G.; Berger, James O.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+OCT 2010"
Nonparametric Bayesian Bi-Clustering for Next Generation Sequencing Count Data,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/13-BA822,2013,28,3,"Histone modifications (HMs) play important roles in transcription through post-translational modifications. Combinations of HMs, known as chromatin signatures, encode specific messages for gene regulation. We therefore expect that inference on possible clustering of HMs and an annotation of genomic locations on the basis of such clustering can contribute new insights about the functions of regulatory elements and their relationships to combinations of HMs. We propose a nonparametric Bayesian local clustering Poisson model (NoB-LCP) to facilitate posterior inference on two-dimensional clustering of HMs and genomic locations. The NoB-LCP clusters HMs into HM sets and lets each HM set define its own clustering of genomic locations. Furthermore, it probabilistically excludes HMs and genomic locations that are irrelevant to clustering. By doing so, the proposed model effectively identifies important sets of HMs and groups regulatory elements with similar functionality based on HM patterns.","ChIP-Seq,Histone modifications,Nonparametric Bayes,Bi-Clustering,Markov chain Monte Carlo","GENE-EXPRESSION DATA,MICROARRAY DATA,HUMAN GENOME,HISTONE MODIFICATIONS,STEM-CELLS,METHYLATIONS,ENHANCERS,DOMAINS","Xu, Yanxun@Rice Univ, Dept Stat, Houston, TX 77251 USA@Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Bioinformat & Computat Syst, Houston, TX 77030 USA::Lee, Juhee@Ohio State Univ, Dept Stat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA::Yuan, Yuan@Baylor Coll Med, Grad Program Struct & Computat Biol & Mol Biophys, Houston, TX 77030 USA::Mitra, Riten@Univ Texas Austin, Dept Math, Austin, TX 78712 USA::Liang, Shoudan@Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Bioinformat & Computat Syst, Houston, TX 77030 USA::Mueller, Peter@Univ Texas Austin, Dept Math, Austin, TX 78712 USA::Ji, Yuan@NorthShore Univ HealthSyst, Chicago, IL USA","Xu, Yanxun@UTMD Anderson Cancer Center@University of Texas System@Rice University::Lee, Juhee@Ohio State University::Yuan, Yuan@Baylor College of Medicine::Mitra, Riten@University of Texas Austin@University of Texas System::Liang, Shoudan@UTMD Anderson Cancer Center@University of Texas System::Mueller, Peter@University of Texas Austin@University of Texas System::Ji, Yuan@NorthShore University Health System","Yuan, Yuan@H-4007-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4706-7897","Nucleosomes are well positioned in exons and carry characteristic histone modifications+Andersson, Robin; Enroth, Stefan; Rada-Iglesias, Alvaro; et al.+GENOME RESEARCH+OCT 2009::CTCFBSDB: a CTCF-binding site database for characterization of vertebrate genomic insulators+Bao, Lei; Zhou, Mi; Cui, Yan+NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH+JAN 2008::High-resolution profiling of histone methylations in the human genome+Barski, Artern; Cuddapah, Suresh; Cui, Kairong; et al.+CELL+MAY 18 2007::A bivalent chromatin structure marks key developmental genes in embryonic stem cells+Bernstein, BE; Mikkelsen, TS; Xie, XH; et al.+CELL+APR 21 2006::Methylation of histone H3 Lys 4 in coding regions of active genes+Bernstein, BE; Humphrey, EL; Erlich, RL; et al.+PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA+JUN 25 2002::Bayesian Model Choice via Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods+Carlin, B.; Chib, S.+Journal of the Royal Statistical Society+1995::Biclustering of expression data.+Cheng, Y; Church, G M+Proceedings.

Bayesian Estimation of the Discrepancy with Misspecified Parametric Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/13-BA024,2013,23,0,We study a Bayesian model where we have made specific requests about the parameter values to be estimated. The aim is to find the parameter of a parametric family which minimizes a distance to the data generating density and then to estimate the discrepancy using nonparametric methods. We illustrate how coherent updating can proceed given that the standard Bayesian posterior from an unidentifiable model is inappropriate. Our updating is performed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and in particular a novel method for dealing with intractable normalizing constants is required.

"Feature Allocations, Probability Functions, and Paintboxes",BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/13-BA823,2013,19,11,"The problem of inferring a clustering of a data set has been the subject of much research in Bayesian analysis, and there currently exists a solid mathematical foundation for Bayesian approaches to clustering. In particular, the class of probability distributions over partitions of a data set has been characterized in a number of ways, including via exchangeable partition probability functions (EPPFs) and the Kingman paintbox. Here, we develop a generalization of the clustering problem, called feature allocation, where we allow each data point to belong to an arbitrary, non-negative integer number of groups, now called features or topics. We define and study an ""exchangeable feature probability function"" (EFPF)-analogous to the EPPF in the clustering setting-for certain types of feature models. Moreover, we introduce a ""feature paintbox"" characterization-analogous to the Kingman paintbox for clustering-of the class of exchangeable feature models. We provide a further characterization of the subclass of feature allocations that have EFPF representations.","feature,feature allocation,paintbox,EFPF,feature frequency model,Indian buffet process,beta process",,"Broderick, Tamara@Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Stat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA::Pitman, Jim@Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Stat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA::Jordan, Michael I.@Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Stat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Broderick, Tamara@University of California System@University of California Berkeley::Pitman, Jim@University of California System@University of California Berkeley::Jordan, Michael I.@University of California System@University of California Berkeley",not exist,"Exchangeability and related topics+Aldous, D.+Ecole d'ete probabilites de Saint-Flour, XIII-1983+1985::Combinatorial clustering and the beta negative binomial process+Broderick, T.; Mackey, L.; Paisley, J.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Jordan, M.

The algorithm minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence of an approximating distribution to the intractable posterior distribution. Our method can be used to approximate any posterior distribution, provided that it is given in closed form up to the proportionality constant. The approximation can be any distribution in the exponential family or any mixture of such distributions, which means that it can be made arbitrarily precise. Several examples illustrate the speed and accuracy of our approximation method in practice.","variational Bayes,approximate inference,stochastic approximation","GRAPHICAL MODELS,EFFICIENT,GRADIENT","Salimans, Tim@Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands::Knowles, David A.@Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Salimans, Tim@Erasmus University Rotterdam::Knowles, David A.@Stanford University",not exist,"An Introduction to R+Albert, Jim+BAYESIAN COMPUTATION WITH R, SECOND EDITION+2009::Neural learning in structured parameter spaces - Natural Riemannian gradient+Amari, S+ADVANCES IN NEURAL INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS 9: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 1996 CONFERENCE+1997::A variational Bayesian framework for graphical models+Attias, H+ADVANCES IN NEURAL INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS 12+2000::The variational Bayesian EM algorithm for incomplete data: with application to scoring graphical model structures+Beal, M.

Clustered Bayesian Model Averaging,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/13-BA859,2013,33,0,"It is sometimes preferable to conduct statistical analyses based on the combination of several models rather than on the selection of a single model, thus taking into account the uncertainty about the true model. Models are usually combined using constant weights that do not distinguish between different regions of the covariate space. However, a procedure that performs well in a given situation may not do so in another situation. In this paper, we propose the concept of local Bayes factors, where we calculate the Bayes factors by restricting the models to regions of the covariate space. The covariate space is split in such a way that the relative model efficiencies of the various Bayesian models are about the same in the same region while differing in different regions. An algorithm for clustered Bayes averaging is then proposed for model combination, where local Bayes factors are used to guide the weighting of the Bayesian models. Simulations and real data studies show that clustered Bayesian averaging results in better predictive performance compared to a single Bayesian model or Bayesian model averaging where models are combined using the same weights over the entire covariate space.","Bayesian Model Averaging,Clustered Bayes Factor,Local Averaging","ADAPTIVE REGRESSION,VARIABLE SELECTION,GRAPHICAL MODELS,2 CULTURES","Yu, Qingzhao@Louisiana State Univ, Hlth Sci Ctr, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA::MacEachern, Steven N.@Ohio State Univ, Dept Stat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA::Peruggia, Mario@Ohio State Univ, Dept Stat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Yu, Qingzhao@Louisiana State University System@Louisiana State University::MacEachern, Steven N.@Ohio State University::Peruggia, Mario@Ohio State University","MacEachern, Steve@C-5299-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4106-1232","An overview of robust Bayesian analysis+Berger, J.

On the Prior and Posterior Distributions Used in Graphical Modelling,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/13-BA819,2013,52,7,"Graphical model learning and inference are often performed using Bayesian techniques. In particular, learning is usually performed in two separate steps. First, the graph structure is learned from the data; then the parameters of the model are estimated conditional on that graph structure. While the probability distributions involved in this second step have been studied in depth, the ones used in the first step have not been explored in as much detail.

In this paper, we will study the prior and posterior distributions defined over the space of the graph structures for the purpose of learning the structure of a graphical model. In particular, we will provide a characterisation of the behaviour of those distributions as a function of the possible edges of the graph. We will then use the properties resulting from this characterisation to define measures of structural variability for both Bayesian and Markov networks, and we will point out some of their possible applications.","Markov Networks,Bayesian Networks,Random Graphs,Structure Learning,Multivariate Discrete Distributions",LEARNING BAYESIAN NETWORKS,"Scutari, Marco@UCL, Genet Inst, London WC1E 6BT, England","Scutari, Marco@University of London@University College London",not exist,"Multivariate tests comparing binomial probabilities, with application to safety studies for drugs+Agresti, A; Klingenberg, B+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2005::Basic Terminology, Notation and Results+Bang-Jensen, Jorgen; Gutin, Gregory+DIGRAPHS: THEORY, ALGORITHMS AND APPLICATIONS, SECOND EDITION+2009::no title+Bibby, J.M; Kent, J.T; Mardia, K.V.+Multivariate Analysis+1979::no title+Bilodeau, M.; Brenner, D.+Theory of Multivariate Statistics+1999::no title+Bishop, YM; Light, RJ; Mosteller, F.+Discrete multivariate analysis: theory and practice+2007::no title+Bollobas, B.+Random Graphs+2001::Theory Refinement on Bayesian Networks+Buntine, W.+P 7 C UNC ART INT+1991::Optimal structure identification with greedy search+Chickering, D.M.+Journal of Machine Learning Research+1 April 2003::A transformational characterization of equivalent Bayesian networks+Chickering, DM.+P 11 C UNC ART INT+1995::no title+Cowell, R.

We also derive a finite sum representation that converges almost surely to the Ferguson and Klass representation of the normalized inverse-Gaussian process.

Hypothesis Assessment and Inequalities for Bayes Factors and Relative Belief Ratios,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/13-BA824,2013,29,12,"We discuss the definition of a Bayes factor and develop some inequalities relevant to Bayesian inferences. An approach to hypothesis assessment based on the computation of a Bayes factor, a measure of the strength of the evidence given by the Bayes factor via a posterior probability, and the point where the Bayes factor is maximized is recommended. It is also recommended that the a priori properties of a Bayes factor be considered to assess possible bias inherent in the Bayes factor. This methodology can be seen to deal with many of the issues and controversies associated with hypothesis assessment.

Bayesian Demographic Accounts: Subnational Population Estimation Using Multiple Data Sources,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/13-BA820,2013,46,12,"Demographic estimates for small areas within a country have many uses. Subnational population estimation is, however, difficult, requiring the synthesis of multiple inconsistent datasets. Current methods have important limitations, including a heavy reliance on ad hoc adjustment and limited allowance for uncertainty. In this paper we demonstrate how subnational population estimation can be carried out within a formal Bayesian framework. The core of the framework is a demographic account, providing a complete description of the demographic system. Regularities within the demographic account are described by a system model. The relationship between the demographic account and the observable data is described by an observation model. Posterior simulation is carried out using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. We illustrate the methods using data for six regions within New Zealand.","demography,official statistics,population estimation,hierarchical Bayesian model,MCMC","MODELS,DISTRIBUTIONS,IMMIGRATION,COUNTRIES,MORTALITY,VARIANCE,ENGLAND,SIZE","Bryant, John R.@Unknow::Graham, Patrick J.@Unknow","Bryant, John R.@Unknow::Graham, Patrick J.@Unknow",not exist,"no title+Alho,, J.

Bayesian Nonparametric ROC Regression Modeling,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/13-BA825,2013,41,16,"The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is the most widely used measure for evaluating the discriminatory performance of a continuous biomarker. Incorporating covariates in the analysis can potentially enhance information gathered from the biomarker, as its discriminatory ability may depend on these. In this paper we propose a dependent Bayesian nonparametric model for conditional ROC estimation. Our model is based on dependent Dirichlet processes, where the covariate-dependent ROC curves are indirectly modeled using probability models for related probability distributions in the diseased and healthy groups. Our approach allows for the entire distribution in each group to change as a function of the covariates, provides exact posterior inference up to a Monte Carlo error, and can easily accommodate multiple continuous and categorical predictors. Simulation results suggest that, regarding the mean squared error, our approach performs better than its competitors for small sample sizes and nonlinear scenarios. The proposed model is applied to data concerning diagnosis of diabetes.","Conditional area under the curve,related probability distributions,dependent Dirichlet process,Markov chain Monte Carlo","OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC CURVES,DIRICHLET PRIORS,DISTRIBUTIONS,MIXTURE,COMPONENTS,DISEASE,TESTS","Inacio de Carvalho, Vanda@Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Stat, Santiago, Chile@Univ Lisbon, Ctr Stat & Applicat, P-1699 Lisbon, Portugal::Jara, Alejandro@Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Stat, Santiago, Chile::Hanson, Timothy E.@Unknow::de Carvalho, Miguel@Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Stat, Santiago, Chile@Univ Nova Lisboa, Ctr Math & Applicat, P-1200 Lisbon, Portugal","Inacio de Carvalho, Vanda@Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile@Universidade de Lisboa::Jara, Alejandro@Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile::Hanson, Timothy E.@Unknow::de Carvalho, Miguel@Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile@Universidade de Lisboa@Universidade Nova de Lisboa","Hanson, Timothy@A-9127-2016::Inacio de Carvalho, Vanda@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8084-1616::de Carvalho, Miguel@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3248-6984","Distribution-free ROC analysis using binary regression techniques+Alonzo, TA; Pepe, MS+BIOSTATISTICS+SEP 2002::On the Support of MacEachern's Dependent Dirichlet Processes and Extensions+Barrientos, Andres F.; Jara, Alejandro; Quintana, Fernando A.+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2012::FERGUSON DISTRIBUTIONS VIA POLYA URN SCHEMES+BLACKWELL, D; MACQUEEN, JB+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1973::Bayesian semiparametric ROC curve estimation and disease diagnosis+Branscum, Adam J.; Johnson, Wesley O.; Hanson, Timothy E.; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUN 15 2008::Semi-parametric ROC regression analysis with placement values+Cai, TX+BIOSTATISTICS+JAN 2004::An ANOVA model for dependent random measures+De Iorio, M; Muller, P; Rosner, GL; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2004::Bayesian Nonparametric Nonproportional Hazards Survival Modeling+De Iorio, Maria; Johnson, Wesley O.; Mueller, Peter; et al.+BIOMETRICS+SEP 2009::Semiparametric Bayesian classification with longitudinal markers+De la Cruz-Mesia, Rolando; Quintana, Fernando A.; Mueller, Peter+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2007::COMPOUND GAMMA, BETA AND F DISTRIBUTIONS+DUBEY, SD+METRIKA+1970::Flexible smoothing with B-splines and penalties+Eilers, PHC; Marx, BD+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 1996::Bayesian semi-parametric ROC analysis+Erkanli, Alaattin; Sung, Minje; Costello, E.

Prediction in M-complete Problems with Limited Sample Size,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/13-BA826,2013,30,1,"We define a new Bayesian predictor called the posterior weighted median (PWM) and compare its performance to several other predictors including the Bayes model average under squared error loss, the Barbieri-Berger median model predictor, the stacking predictor, and the model average predictor based on Akaike's information criterion. We argue that PWM generally gives better performance than other predictors over a range of M-complete problems. This range is between the M-closed-M-complete boundary and the M-complete-M-open boundary. Indeed, as a problem gets closer to M-open, it seems that M-complete predictive methods begin to break down. Our comparisons rest on extensive simulations and real data examples.

As a separate issue, we introduce the concepts of the 'Bail out effect' and the 'Bail in effect'. These occur when a predictor gives not just poor results but defaults to the simplest model ('bails out') or to the most complex model ('bails in') on the model list. Either can occur in M-complete problems when the complexity of the data generator is too high for the predictor scheme to accommodate.","M-complete,prediction,ensemble methods,basis selection,model selection,model list selection","MODEL SELECTION,REGRESSION VARIABLES","Clarke, Jennifer Lynn@Univ Miami, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Div Biostat, Miami, FL 33136 USA::Clarke, Bertrand@Univ Miami, Dept Med, Ctr Computat Sci, Miami, FL USA@Univ Miami, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Ctr Computat Sci, Miami, FL USA::Yu, Chi-Wai@Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Math, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Clarke, Jennifer Lynn@University of Miami::Clarke, Bertrand@University of Miami::Yu, Chi-Wai@Hong Kong University of Science & Technology","Clarke, Jennifer@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2723-7249","Optimal predictive model selection+Barbieri, MM; Berger, JO+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2004::MINIMUM COMPLEXITY DENSITY-ESTIMATION+BARRON, AR; COVER, TM+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY+JUL 1991::no title+Bernardo, J.

Some Priors for Sparse Regression Modelling,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/13-BA827,2013,21,9,"A wide range of methods, Bayesian and others, tackle regression when there are many variables. In the Bayesian context, the prior is constructed to reflect ideas of variable selection and to encourage appropriate shrinkage. The prior needs to be reasonably robust to different signal to noise structures. Two simple evergreen prior constructions stem from ridge regression on the one hand and g-priors on the other. We seek to embed recent ideas about sparsity of the regression coefficients and robustness into these priors. We also explore the gains that can be expected from these differing approaches.","Correlated priors,Canonical reduction,Multiple regression,g-priors,Markov chain Monte Carlo,Normal-Gamma prior,p > n; Ridge regression,Robust priors,Sparsity","RIDGE-REGRESSION,BAYES FACTORS,SHRINKAGE","Griffin, Jim E.@Univ Kent, Sch Math Stat & Actuarial Sci, Canterbury, Kent, England::Brown, Philip.

A Bayesian Dose-finding Design for Drug Combination Trials with Delayed Toxicities,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/13-BA839,2013,22,7,"We propose a Bayesian adaptive dose-finding design for drug combination trials with delayed toxicity. We model the dose-toxicity relationship using the Finney model, a model widely used in drug-drug interaction studies. The intuitive interpretations of the Finney model facilitate incorporating the available prior dose-toxicity information from single-agent trials into combination trials through prior elicitation. We treat unobserved delayed toxicity outcomes as missing data and handle them using Bayesian data augmentation. We conduct extensive simulation studies to examine the operating characteristics of the proposed method under various practical scenarios. Results show that the proposed design is safe and able to select the target dose combinations with high probabilities.","Adaptive design,Late-onset toxicity,Combining drugs,Missing data,Maximum tolerated dose,Phase I trial","PHASE-I TRIALS,RADIATION-THERAPY,2 AGENTS,ONCOLOGY,CANCER","Liu, Suyu@Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Biostat, Houston, TX 77030 USA::Ning, Jing@Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Biostat, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Liu, Suyu@UTMD Anderson Cancer Center@University of Texas System::Ning, Jing@UTMD Anderson Cancer Center@University of Texas System",not exist,"A Hierarchical Bayesian Design for Phase I Trials of Novel Combinations of Cancer Therapeutic Agents+Braun, Thomas M.; Wang, Shufang+BIOMETRICS+SEP 2010::Sequential designs for phase I clinical trials with late-onset toxicities+Cheung, K; Chappell, R.+Biometrics+2000::LATE EFFECTS OF RADIATION-THERAPY ON THE GASTROINTESTINAL-TRACT+COIA, LR; MYERSON, RJ; TEPPER, JE+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS+MAR 30 1995::Designs for single- or multiple-agent phase I trials+Conaway, MR; Dunbar, S; Peddada, SD+BIOMETRICS+SEP 2004::LATE EFFECTS OF RADIATION-THERAPY IN THE HEAD AND NECK REGION+COOPER, JS; FU, K; MARKS, J; et al.+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS+MAR 30 1995::no title+Finney, DJ.+Probit analysis+1971::no title+Govindarajulu, Z.+Statistical techniques in bioassay+2001::THE SEARCH FOR SYNERGY - A CRITICAL-REVIEW FROM A RESPONSE-SURFACE PERSPECTIVE+GRECO, WR; BRAVO, G; PARSONS, JC+PHARMACOLOGICAL REVIEWS+JUN 1995::Utility-Based Optimization of Combination Therapy Using Ordinal Toxicity and Efficacy in Phase I/II Trials+Houede, Nadine; Thall, Peter F.; Nguyen, Hoang; et al.+BIOMETRICS+JUN 2010::Combinated effects I Announcement - Implements to the problem+Loewe, S; Muischnek, H+NAUNYN-SCHMIEDEBERGS ARCHIV FUR EXPERIMENTELLE PATHOLOGIE UND PHARMAKOLOGIE+1926::Dose-finding approach for dose escalation with overdose control considering incomplete observations+Mauguen, A.; Le Deley, M.

Bayesian Nonparametric Inference Why and How Comment,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/13-BA811B,2013,15,0,"Due to their great flexibility, nonparametric Bayes methods have proven to be a valuable tool for discovering complicated patterns in data. The term nonparametric Bayes suggests that these methods inherit model-free operating characteristics of classical nonparametric methods, as well as coherent uncertainty assessments provided by Bayesian procedures. However, as the authors say in the conclusion to their article, nonparametric Bayesian methods may be more aptly described as massively parametric. Furthermore, I argue that many of the default nonparametric Bayes procedures are only Bayesian in the weakest sense of the term, and cannot be assumed to provide honest assessments of uncertainty merely because they carry the Bayesian label. However useful such procedures may be, we should be cautious about advertising default nonparametric Bayes procedures as either being assumption free or providing descriptions of our uncertainty. If we want our nonparametric Bayes procedures to have a Bayesian interpretation, we should modify default NP Bayes methods to accommodate real prior information, or at the very least, carefully evaluate the effects of hyperparameters on posterior quantities of interest.","marginal likelihood,model misspecification,prior specification,sandwich estimation","DIRICHLET PROCESS,LIKELIHOOD,DISTRIBUTIONS","Hoff, Peter D.@Univ Washington, Dept Stat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA@Univ Washington, Dept Biostat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Hoff, Peter D.@University of Washington@University of Washington Seattle",not exist,"Minimally informative prior distributions for non-parametric Bayesian analysis+Bush, Christopher A.; Lee, Juhee; MacEachern, Steven N.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2010::BAYES AND LIKELIHOOD CALCULATIONS FROM CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS+EFRON, B+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1993::Convergence rates for density estimation with Bernstein polynomials+Ghosal, S+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+OCT 2001::Robust likelihood functions in Bayesian inference+Greco, Luca; Racugno, Walter; Ventura, Laura+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+MAY 1 2008::Bayesian sandwich posteriors for pseudo-true parameters+Hoff, P.; Wakefield, J.+Technical Report 605+2012::EXTENDING THE RANK LIKELIHOOD FOR SEMIPARAMETRIC COPULA ESTIMATION+Hoff, Peter D.+ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS+JUN 2007::The behavior of maximum likelihood estimates under non-standard conditions+Huber, PJ.+P 5 BERK S MATH STAT+1967::Marginally Specified Priors for Non-parametric Bayesian Estimation+Kessler, D.; Hoff, P.; Dunson, D.+Technical Report 596+2012::Bayesian empirical likelihood+Lazar, NA+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 2003::Means of a Dirichlet process and multiple hypergeometric functions+Lijoi, A; Regazzini, E+ANNALS OF PROBABILITY+APR 2004::Bayesian Nonparametric Inference - Why and How+Muller, P.; Mitra, R.+Bayesian Analysis+2013::Risk of Bayesian inference in misspecified models, and the sandwich covariance matrix+Muller, U.+RISK BAYESIAN UNPUB+2012::ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BAYESIAN AND NON-BAYESIAN INTERVAL ESTIMATES+SEVERINI, TA+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1991::MODEL-ROBUST REGRESSION AND A BAYESIAN ""SANDWICH"" ESTIMATOR+Szpiro, Adam A.; Rice, Kenneth M.; Lumley, Thomas+ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS+DEC 2010::CHARACTERISTIC FUNCTIONS OF MEANS OF DISTRIBUTIONS CHOSEN FROM A DIRICHLET PROCESS+YAMATO, H+ANNALS OF PROBABILITY+1984"

These priors were defined as the solution of a system of two integral equations that under some general assumptions has a unique solution associated with a recurrent Markov chain. Later, in Cano et al. (2012b) integral priors were successfully applied in some situations where they are known and they are unique, being proper or not, and it was pointed out how to deal with other situations. Here, we present some new situations to illustrate how this new methodology works in the cases where we are not able to explicitly find the integral priors but we know they are proper and unique (one-sided testing for the exponential distribution) and in the cases where recurrence of the associated Markov chains is difficult to check. To deal with this latter scenario we impose a technical constraint on the imaginary training samples space that virtually implies the existence and the uniqueness of integral priors which are proper distributions. The improvement over other existing methodologies comes from the fact that this method is more automatic since we only need to simulate from the involved models and their posteriors to compute very well behaved Bayes factors.","Bayesian model selection,Bayes factor,intrinsic priors,integral priors","PRIOR DISTRIBUTIONS,SELECTION","Antonio Cano, Juan@Univ Murcia, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Espinardo, Spain::Salmeron, Diego@Reg Hlth Author, Dept Epidemiol, Murcia, Spain","Antonio Cano, Juan@University of Murcia::Salmeron, Diego@Unknow",not exist,"Integral priors for the one way random effects model+Antonio Cano, Juan; Kessler, Mathieu; Salmeron, Diego+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2007::On the convergence of the Markov chain simulation method+Athreya, KB; Doss, H; Sethuraman, J+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 1996::Training samples in objective Bayesian model selection+Berger, JO; Pericchi, LR+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2004::The intrinsic Bayes factor for model selection and prediction+Berger, JO; Pericchi, LR+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1996::A synopsis of integral priors for the one way random effects model+Cano, J.

Parameter Interpretation in Skewed Logistic Regression with Random Intercept,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/13-BA813,2013,26,8,"This paper aims at providing the prior and posterior interpretations for the parameters in the logistic regression model with random or cluster-level intercept when univariate and multivariate classes of skew normal distributions are assumed to model the random effects behavior. We obtain the prior distributions for the odds ratio and their medians under skew normality for the random effects. Original results related to linear combinations of skew-normal distributions are obtained as a by-product and, in the univariate case, a new class of log-skew-normal distribution is introduced. Robust results are obtained whenever a class of multivariate skew-normal distribution is assumed. We also evaluate the effect of the misspecification of the random effects distributions in the odds ratio estimation. We consider both simulated and the Teratogenic activity experiment datasets. The latter was previously analysed in the literature. We concluded that the misspecification of the random effects distribution yields poor odds ratios estimates and that the median odds ratio is not necessarily the best measure of heterogeneity among the clusters as suggested in the literature.","Cluster,mixed models,random odds ratio,skew normal distribution","LINEAR MIXED MODELS,DISTRIBUTIONS","Santos, Cristiano C.@Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Pampulha, Brazil::Loschi, Rosangela H.@Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Pampulha, Brazil::Arellano-Valle, Reinaldo B.@Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile","Santos, Cristiano C.@Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais::Loschi, Rosangela H.@Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais::Arellano-Valle, Reinaldo B.@Pontificia Universidad  Catolica de Chile",not exist,"A family of tests to detect misspecifications in the random-effects structure of generalized linear mixed models+Alonso, A.; Litiere, S.; Molenberghs, G.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+MAY 15 2008::On the unification of families of skew-normal distributions+Arellano-Valle, Reinaldo B.; Azzalini, Adelchi+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+SEP 2006::The multivariate skew-normal distribution+Azzalini, A; DallaValle, A+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1996::A CLASS OF DISTRIBUTIONS WHICH INCLUDES THE NORMAL ONES+AZZALINI, A+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+1985::APPROXIMATE INFERENCE IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS+BRESLOW, NE; CLAYTON, DG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::The skew-normal distribution+Dalla Valle, A+SKEW-ELLIPTICAL DISTRIBUTIONS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS: A JOURNEY BEYOND NORMALITY+2004::no title+Diggle, P.; Diggle, P.+Analysis of Longitudinal Data+2002::no title+Fitzmaurice, GM; Laird, NM; Ware, JH.+Applied Longitudinal Analysis+2004::A RANDOM-EFFECTS PROBIT MODEL FOR PREDICTING MEDICAL MALPRACTICE CLAIMS+GIBBONS, RD; HEDEKER, D; CHARLES, SC; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1994::Adaptive rejection sampling for Gibbs sampling+Gilks, W.

An Adaptive Sequential Monte Carlo Sampler,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/13-BA814,2013,49,9,"Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods are not only a popular tool in the analysis of state-space models, but offer an alternative to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in situations where Bayesian inference must proceed via simulation. This paper introduces a new SMC method that uses adaptive MCMC kernels for particle dynamics. The proposed algorithm features an online stochastic optimization procedure to select the best MCMC kernel and simultaneously learn optimal tuning parameters. Theoretical results are presented that justify the approach and give guidance on how it should be implemented. Empirical results, based on analysing data from mixture models, show that the new adaptive SMC algorithm (ASMC) can both choose the best MCMC kernel, and learn an appropriate scaling for it. ASMC with a choice between kernels outperformed the adaptive MCMC algorithm of Haario et al.

A One-Pass Sequential Monte Carlo Method for Bayesian Analysis of Massive Datasets,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/06-BA112,2006,22,14,"For Bayesian analysis of massive data, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques often prove infeasible due to computational resource constraints. Standard MCMC methods generally require a complete scan of the data set for each iteration. Ridge way and Madigan (2002) and Chopin (2002b) recently presented importance sampling algorithms that combined simulations from a posterior distribution conditioned on a small portion of the dataset with are weighting of those simulations to condition on the remainder of the dataset. While these algorithms drastically reduce the number of data accesses as compared to traditional MCMC, they still require substantially more than a single pass over the dataset. In this paper, we present ""IPFS,"" an efficient, one-pass algorithm. The algorithm employs a simple modification of the Ridge way and Madigan (2002) particle filtering algorithm that replaces the MCMC based ""rejuvenation"" step with a more efficient ""shrinkage"" kernel smoothing based step. To show proof of-concept and to enable a direct comparison, we demonstrate IPFS on the same examples presented in Ridge way and Madigan (2002), namely a mixture model for Markov chains and Bayesian logistic regression. Our results indicate the proposed scheme delivers accurate parameter estimates while employing only a single pass through the data.","Sequential Monte Carlo,One-Pass,Massive Datasets",,"Balakrishnan, Suhrid@Rutgers State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA::Madigan, David@Rutgers State Univ, Dept Stat, Piscataway, NJ USA","Balakrishnan, Suhrid@Rutgers State University New Brunswick::Madigan, David@Rutgers State University New Brunswick",not exist,"no title+AITCHISON J+APPL STAT-J ROY ST C+1985::Visualization of navigation patterns on a web site using model based clustering+Cadez, I; Heckerman, D; Meek, C<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Smyth, P; White, S</span>.+Technical report, Technical Report MSR-TR-00-18+2000::A sequential particle filter method for static models+Chopin, N+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 2002::no title+CHOPIN N+CENTRAL LIMIT THEORE+2002::no title+Doucet, A; Freitas, ND; Gordon, N.+Sequential Monte Carlo methods in practice+2001::Bayesian data mining in large frequency tables, with an application to the FDA spontaneous reporting system+DuMouchel, W+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 1999::no title+FIGUEIREDO MAT+ADV NEURAL INFORM PR+2001::Learning bayesian network structure from massive datasets: The sparse candidate algorithm+Friedman, N.; Nachman, I.; Peer, D.+15 C UNC ART INT+1999::no title+GENKIN A+BAYESIAN LOGIS UNPUB+2004::BAYESIAN-INFERENCE IN ECONOMETRIC-MODELS USING MONTE-CARLO INTEGRATION+GEWEKE, J+ECONOMETRICA+NOV 1989::Following a moving target - Monte Carlo inference for dynamic Bayesian models+Gilks, WR; Berzuini, C+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2001::Central limit theorem for nonlinear filtering and interacting particle systems+Guionnet, A; Moral, P D.+Ann Appl Probab+1999::SEQUENTIAL IMPUTATIONS AND BAYESIAN MISSING DATA PROBLEMS+KONG, A; LIU, JS; WONG, WH+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1994::no title+Liu, J.; West, M.+Combined Parameter and State Estimation in Simulation-Based Filtering+2001::Hierarchical model-based clustering for large datasets+Posse, C+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+SEP 2001::Bayesian clustering by dynamics+Ramoni, M; Sebastiani, P; Cohen, P+MACHINE LEARNING+2002::A sequential Monte Carlo method for Bayesian analysis of massive datasets+Ridgeway, G.; Madigan, D.+Journal of Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining+2002::no title+RIDGEWAY G+MSRTR9724+1997::Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Dirichlet Distributions+Ronning, G.+Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation+1989::no title+Silverman, B.W.+Density Estimation for Statistics and Data Analysis+1986::no title+Stavropoulos, P.; Titterington, D.

Misinformation in the conjugate prior for the linear model with implications for free-knot spline modelling,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/06-BA114,2006,16,4,"In the conjugate prior for the normal linear model, the prior variance for the coefficients is a multiple of the erro variance parameter. However, if the prior mean for the coefficients is poorly chosen, the posterior distribution of the model can be seriously distorted because of prior dependence between the coefficients and error variance. In particular, the error variance will be overestimated, as will the posterior variance of the coefficients. This occurs because the prior mean, which can be thought of as a weighted pseudo-observation, is an outlier with respect to the real observations. While this situation will be easily noticed and avoided in simple models, in more complicated models, the effect can be easily overlooked. The issue arises in the unit information (UI) prior, a conjugate prior in which the prior contributes information equal to that in one observation. In particular, a successful Bayesian nonparametric regression model-Bayesian Adaptive Regression Splines (BARS)-that relies on the UI prior for its model selection step suffers from this problem, and addressing the problem within the Bayesian paradigm alters the penalty on model dimensionality.","Bayes factor,BIC,model selection,nonparametric regression,unit information prior",,"Paciorek, Christopher J.@Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Paciorek, Christopher J.@Harvard University",not exist,"no title+CLYDE M+MODEL SELECTION+2001::Bayesian curve-fitting with free-knot splines+DiMatteo, I; Genovese, CR; Kass, RE+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 2001::THE RISK INFLATION CRITERION FOR MULTIPLE-REGRESSION+FOSTER, DP; GEORGE, EI+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1994::no title+Gelman, A.; Carlin, J.

I have deliberately chosen rather dramatic, perhaps inflammatory, language in the above sentences. I do not expect all readers to view Berger's proposals in the same terms, but I hope that they will find my comments thought-provoking and constructive. It is undoubtedly true that the use of weakly informative prior distributions is both essential and valuable in practice. However, it is vitally important that their role is properly understood, instead of being grossly overstated.

A comparison of Bayesian and likelihood-based methods for fitting multilevel models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/06-BA117,2006,90,232,"We use simulation studies, whose design is realistic for educational and medical research (as well as other fields of inquiry), to compare Bayesian and likelihood-based methods for fitting variance-components (VC) and random-effects logistic regression (RELR) models. The likelihood (and approximate likelihood) approaches we examine are based on the methods most widely used in current applied ultilevel (hierarchical) analyses: maximum likelihood (ML) and restricted ML (REML) for Gaussian outcomes, and marginal and penalized quasi-likelihood MQL and PQL) for Bernoulli outcomes. Our Bayesian methods use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation, with adaptive hybrid Metropolis-Gibbs sampling for RELR models, and several diffuse prior distributions (Gamma(-1)(epsilon,epsilon) and U(0,1/epsilon) priors for variance components). For evaluation criteria we consider bias of point estimates and nominal versus actual coverage of interval estimates in repeated sampling. In two-level VC models we find that (a) both likelihood-based and Bayesian approaches can be made to produce approximately unbiased estimates, although the automatic manner in which REML accomplishes this is an dvantage, but (b) both approaches had difficulty achieving nominal coverage in small samples and with small values of the intraclass correlation. With the three level RELR models we examine we find that (c) quasi-likelihood methods for estimating random-effects variances perform badly with respect to bias and coverage in the example we simulated, and (d) Bayesian diffuse-prior methods lead to well-calibrated point and interval RELR estimates. While it is true that the likelihood-based methods we study are considerably faster computationally than MCMC, (i) steady improvements in recent years in both hardware speed and efficiency of Monte Carlo algorithms and (ii) the lack of calibration of likelihood-based methods in some common hierarchical settings combine to make MCMC-based Bayesian fitting of multilevel models an attractive approach, even with rather large data sets. Other analytic strategies based on less approximate likelihood methods are also possible but would benefit from further study of the type summarized here.","Adaptive MCMC,bias,calibration,diffuse priors,hierarchical modeling,hybrid Metropolis-Gibbs sampling,intraclass correlation,IGLS,interval coverage,MQL,mixed models,PQL,RIGLS,random-effects logistic regression,REML,variance-components models",,"Browne, William J.@Univ Nottingham, Div Stat, Sch Math Sci, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England::Draper, David@Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Appl Math & Stat, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Browne, William J.@University of Nottingham::Draper, David@University of California Santa Cruz@University of California System","Browne, William@A-8686-2010@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6659-6885","A general maximum likelihood analysis of variance components in generalized linear models+Aitkin, M+BIOMETRICS+MAR 1999::A general maximum likelihood analysis of overdispersion in generalized linear models+Aitkin, M+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+SEP 1996::Meta-analysis by random effect modelling in generalized linear models+Aitkin, M+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+SEP 30 1999::no title+Bernardo, J.

Prior distributions for variance parameters in hierarchical models(Comment on an Article by Browne and Draper),BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/06-BA117A,2006,49,"1,455","Various noninformative prior distributions have been suggested for scale parameters in hierarchical models. We construct a new folded-noncentral-t family of conditionally conjugate priors for hierarchical standard deviation parameters, and then consider noninformative and weakly informative priors in this family. We use an example to illustrate serious problems with the inverse-gamma family of ""noninformative"" prior distributions. We suggest instead to use a uniform prior on the hierarchical standard deviation, using the half-t family when the number of groups is small and in other settings where a weakly informative prior is desired. We also illustrate the use of the half-t family for hierarchical modeling of multiple variance parameters such as arise in the analysis of variance.","Bayesian inference,conditional conjugacy,folded-noncentral-t distribution,half-t distribution,hierarchical model,multilevel model,noninformative prior distribution,weakly informative prior distribution",,"Gelman, Andrew@Columbia Univ, Dept Stat, New York, NY 10027 USA","Gelman, Andrew@Columbia University",not exist,"Modeling covariance matrices in terms of standard deviations and correlations, with application to shrinkage+Barnard, J; McCulloch, R; Meng, XL+STATISTICA SINICA+OCT 2000::P values for composite null models+Bayarri, MJ; Berger, JO+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2000::REFERENCE POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTIONS FOR BAYESIAN-INFERENCE+BERNARDO, JM+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1979::A NOTE ON BAYES ESTIMATES+BICKEL, PJ; BLACKWEL.D+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1967::no title+BOX, G.

The Relationship Between the Power Prior and Hierarchical Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/06-BA118,2006,22,35,"The power prior has emerged as a useful informative prior for the incorporation of historical data in a Bayesian analysis. Viewing hierarchical modeling as the ""gold standard"" for combining information across studies, we provide a formal justification of the power prior by examining formal analytical relationships between the power prior and hierarchical modeling in linear models. Asymptotic relationships between the power prior and hierarchical modeling are obtained for non-normal models, including generalized linear models, for example. These analytical relationships unify the theory of the power prior, demonstrate the generality of the power prior, shed new light on benchmark analyses, and provide insights into the elicitation of the power parameter in the power prior. Several theorems are presented establishing these formal connections, as well as a formal methodology for eliciting a guide value for the power parameter a(0) via hierarchical models.","Generalized linear model,hierarchical model,historical data,power prior,prior elicitation,random effects model",,"Chen, Ming-Hui@Univ Connecticut, Dept Stat, Storrs, CT 06269 USA::Ibrahim, Joseph G.@Univ N Carolina, Dept Biostat, Chapel Hill, NC USA","Chen, Ming-Hui@University of Connecticut::Ibrahim, Joseph G.@University of North Carolina Chapel Hill@University of North Carolina",not exist,"Bayesian methods in health-related research+Berry, D.

The model is highly flexible and readily captures features such as multimodality in predictive survival densities. The approach can be used in a ""black-box"" manner in that the prior information needed to fit the model can be quite vague, and we recommend a particular prior in the absence of information on the baseline survival distribution. The resulting posterior baseline distribution has mass only on the positive reals, a desirable feature in a failure-time model. The formulae needed to fit the model are available in closed-form and the model is relatively easy to code and implement.

Data sets containing there quisite spatial information often contain temporal data aswell. We therefore extend the notion of an SCDF to a spatiotemporal cumulative distribution function (STCDF), with the goal of increasing precision by making use of repeated measurements. Ours is a hierarchical Bayesian approach, with estimation carried out by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We develop linear algebra results and corresponding computational techniques to handle the difficulties in evaluating the likelihood wrought by the large data sets (due to the added temporal component), the inclusion of spatial and temporal random effects, the need to account for measurement error, and the hand ling of missing data. We illustrate the concepts in a univariate setting with an Atlanta ozone data set, and in a bivariate (two pollutant) setting with a California NO/NO(2) dataset.","Air pollution,Bayesian methods,Change of support problem,Kriging,Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods",,"Short, Margaret B.@Los Alamos Natl Lab, Stat Sci Grp, Los Alamos, NM USA::Carlin, Bradley P.@Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Biostat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Short, Margaret B.@Los Alamos National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)::Carlin, Bradley P.@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities",not exist,"On geodetic distance computations in spatial modeling+Banerjee, S+BIOMETRICS+JUN 2005::no title+Banerjee, S.; Carlin, B.

Deviance Information Criteria for Missing Data Models Comment,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/06-BA122D,2006,9,5,"This discussion argues that any difficulty with DIC for missing data is due to DIC being intrinsically a large-sample measure and relying on point estimates. What is missing is not ""missing data"", but rather a set of coherent principles for DIC itself when the amount of data is not adequate to invoke quadratic approximation for a complex model. The non-uniqueness of data augmentation schemes for any observed-data model also argues for the importance of emphasizing inference ""focus"" in applying model complexity measures such as DIC. An attempt to bring in more Bayesian ""favor"" into DIC also reveals that an insightful explanation is missing: neither pure Bayesian measure nor pure likelihood/sampling measure yield sensible results, but some hybrid ones do.","Effective number of parameters,Information criteria,model selection,missing data,statistical principles",,"Meng, Xiao-Li@Harvard Univ, Dept Stat, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA::Vaida, Florin@UCSD Sch Med, Dept Family & Prevent Med, Div Biostat, San Diego, CA USA","Meng, Xiao-Li@Harvard University::Vaida, Florin@University of California San Diego@University of California System",not exist,"Discussion of Speigelhalter et al+Dawid, A.

Bayesian Analysis of Comparative Microarray Experiments by Model Averaging,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/06-BA123,2006,28,13,"A major challenge to the statistical analysis of microarray data is the small number of samples - limited by both cost and sample availability - compared to the large number of genes, now soaring into the tens of thousands per experiment. This situation is made even more difficult by the complex nature of the empirical distributions of gene expression measurements and the necessity to limit the number of false detections due to multiple comparisons. This paper introduces a novel Bayesian method for the analysis of comparative experiments performed with oligonucleotide microarrays. Our method models gene expression data by log-normal and gamma distributions with hierarchical prior distributions on the parameters of interest, and uses model averaging to compute the posterior probability of differential expression. An initial approximate Bayesian analysis is used to identify genes that have a large probability of differential expression, and this list of candidate genes is further refined by using stochastic computations. We assess the performance of this method using real data sets and show that it has an almost negligible false positive rate in small sample experiments that leads to a better detection performance.","Microarrays,gene expression,gamma distribution,log-normal distribution,model averaging,true and false positive rates,false discovery rate",,"Sebastiani, Paola@Boston Univ, Dept Biostat, Boston, MA 02215 USA::Xie, Hui@Boston Univ, Dept Biostat, Boston, MA 02215 USA::Ramoni, Marco F.@Harvard Univ, Childrens Hosp, Sch Med, Informat Program, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Sebastiani, Paola@Boston University::Xie, Hui@Boston University::Ramoni, Marco F.@Harvard University","sebastiani, paola@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6419-1545","A Bayesian framework for the analysis of microarray expression data: regularized t-test and statistical inferences of gene changes+Baldi, P; Long, AD+BIOINFORMATICS+JUN 2001::Ratio-based decisions and the quantitative analysis of cDNA microarray images.+Chen, Y; Dougherty, E R; Bittner, M L+Journal of biomedical optics+1997-Oct::A benchmark for affymetrix GeneChip expression measures+Cope, LM; Irizarry, RA; Jaffee, HA; et al.+BIOINFORMATICS+FEB 12 2004::Statistical methods for identifying differentially expressed genes in replicated cDNA microarray experiments+Dudoit, S; Yang, YH; Callow, MJ; et al.+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 2002::Expression profiling using cDNA microarrays+Duggan, DJ; Bittner, M; Chen, YD; et al.+NATURE GENETICS+JAN 1999::Empirical Bayes analysis of a microarray experiment+Efron, B; Tibshirani, R; Storey, JD; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2001::Inference and monitoring converge+Gelman, A.+Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Practice+1996::no title+GENTLEMAN R+R NEWS+2002::Normality of oligonucleotide microarray data and implications for parametric statistical analyses+Giles, PJ; Kipling, D+BIOINFORMATICS+NOV 22 2003::Bayesian model averaging: A tutorial+Hoeting, JA; Madigan, D; Raftery, AE; et al.+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+NOV 1999::Bayesian models for gene expression with DNA microarray data+Ibrahim, JG; Chen, MH; Gray, RJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2002::GENETIC REGULATORY MECHANISMS IN SYNTHESIS OF PROTEINS+JACOB, F; MONOD, J+JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY+1961::Model-based analysis of oligonucleotide arrays: Expression index computation and outlier detection+Li, C; Wong, WH+PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA+JAN 2 2001::Expression monitoring by hybridization to high-density oligonucleotide arrays+Lockhart, DJ; Dong, HL; Byrne, MC; et al.+NATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY+DEC 1996::no title+MONTANO M+GENES IMMUN IN PRESS+2006::Statistical issues with microarrays: processing and analysis+Nadon, R; Shoemaker, J+TRENDS IN GENETICS+MAY 2002::On differential variability of expression ratios: Improving statistical inference about gene expression changes from microarray data+Newton, MA; Kendziorski, CM; Richmond, CS; et al.+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY+2001::GeneCluster 2.0: an advanced toolset for bioarray analysis+Reich, M; Ohm, K; Angelo, M; et al.+BIOINFORMATICS+JUL 22 2004::Bayesian machine learning and its potential applications to the genomic study of oral oncology.+Sebastiani, P; Yu, Y-H; Ramoni, M F+Advances in dental research+2003-Dec::no title+SEBASTIANI P+P JOINT STAT M SECT+2002::no title+SEBASTIANI P+SCREENING+2006::Statistical challenges in functional genomics+Sebastiani, P; Gussoni, E; Kohane, IS; et al.+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+FEB 2003::no title+SHOEMAKER JS+METHODS MICROARRAY A+2005::BUGS: A program to perform Bayesian inference using Gibbs sampling+Thomas, A.; Spiegelhalter, D.; Gilks, W.+Bayesian Statistics+1992::An efficient and robust statistical modeling approach to discover differentially expressed genes using genomic expression profiles+Thomas, JG; Olson, JM; Tapscott, SJ; et al.+GENOME RESEARCH+JUL 2001::no title+*TUM AN BEST PRACT+NATURE REV GENET+2004::Significance analysis of microarrays applied to the ionizing radiation response+Tusher, VG; Tibshirani, R; Chu, G+PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA+APR 24 2001::Microarrays: How many do you need?+Zien, A; Fluck, J; Zimmer, R; et al.+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY+2003"
Bayesian Modelling and Analysis of Spatio-Temporal Neuronal Networks,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/06-BA124,2006,70,27,"This paper illustrates a novel hierarchical dynamic Bayesian network modelling the spiking patterns of neuronal ensembles over time. We introduce, at separate model stages, the parameters characterizing the discrete-time spiking process, the unknown structure of the functional connections among the analysed neurons and its dependence on their spatial arrangement. Estimates for all model parameters and predictions for future spiking states are computed under the Bayesian paradigm via the standard Gibbs sampler using a shrinkage prior. The adequacy of the model is investigated by plotting the residuals and by applying the time-rescaling theorem. We analyse a simulated dataset and a set of experimental multiple spike trains obtained from a culture of neurons in vitro. For the latter data, we find that one neuron plays a pivotal role for the initiation of each cycle of network activity and that the estimated network structure significantly depends on the spatial arrangement of the neurons.","hierarchical models,shrinkage priors,Bayesian model selection,multiple spike trains analysis,multi-electrode arrays","TRAIN DATA-ANALYSIS,NEURAL SPIKING ACTIVITY,MONTE-CARLO METHODS,VARIABLE SELECTION,REGRESSION-MODELS,POINT-PROCESSES,MARKOV-CHAINS,UNCERTAINTY,DYNAMICS,IDENTIFICATION","Rigat, Fabio@Unknow::de Gunst, Mathisca@Free Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands::van Pelt, Jaap@Unknow","Rigat, Fabio@Unknow::de Gunst, Mathisca@Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam::van Pelt, Jaap@Unknow","Rigat, Fabio@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7904-3019","Bayesian residual analysis for binary response regression models+Albert, J; Chib, S+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1995::no title+Berger, J.+Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis+1985::A BAYESIAN APPROACH TO SOME OUTLIER PROBLEMS+BOX, GEP; TIAO, GC+BIOMETRIKA+1968::Assessing connections in networks of biological neurons+Brillinger, D.

"Combining Experimental Data and Computer Simulations, With an Application to Flyer Plate Experiments",BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/06-BA125,2006,28,36,"A flyer plate experiment involves forcing a plane shock wave through stationary test samples of material and measuring the free surface velocity of the target as a function of time. These experiments are conducted to learn about the behavior of materials subjected to high strain rate environments. Computer simulations of flyer plate experiments are conducted with a two-dimensional hydrodynamic code developed under the Advanced Strategic Computing (ASC) program at Los Alamos National Laboratory. This code incorporates physical models that contain parameters having uncertain values. The objectives of the analyses presented in this paper are to assess the sensitivity of free surface velocity to variations in the uncertain inputs, to constrain the values of these inputs to be consistent with experiment, and to predict free surface velocity based on the constrained inputs. We implement a Bayesian approach that combines detailed physics simulations with experimental data for the desired statistical inference (Kennedy and O'Hagan 2001; Higdon, Kennedy, Cavendish, Cafeo, and Ryne 2004).

The approach given here allows for:

center dot uncertainty regarding model inputs (i. e. calibration);

Variational Bayesian Learning of Directed Graphical Models with Hidden Variables,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/06-BA126,2006,37,37,"A key problem in statistics and machine learning is inferring suitable structure of a model given some observed data. A Bayesian approach to model comparison makes use of the marginal likelihood of each candidate model to form a posterior distribution over models; unfortunately for most models of interest, notably those containing hidden or latent variables, the marginal likelihood is intractable to compute.

We present the variational Bayesian (VB) algorithm for directed graphical models, which optimises a lower bound approximation to the marginal likelihood in a procedure similar to the standard EM algorithm. We show that for a large class of models, which we call conjugate exponential, the VB algorithm is a straightforward generalisation of the EM algorithm that incorporates uncertainty over model parameters. In a thorough case study using a small class of bipartite DAGs containing hidden variables, we compare the accuracy of the VB approximation to existing asymptotic-data approximations such as the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and the Cheeseman-Stutz (CS) criterion, and also to a sampling based gold standard, Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS). We find that the VB algorithm is empirically superior to CS and BIC, and much faster than AIS. Moreover, we prove that a VB approximation can always be constructed in such a way that guarantees it to be more accurate than the CS approximation.","Approximate Bayesian Inference,Bayes Factors,Directed Acyclic Graphs,EM Algorithm,Graphical Models,Markov Chain Monte Carlo,Model Selection,Variational Bayes",,"Beal, Matthew J.@SUNY Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA::Ghahramani, Zoubin@UCL, Gatsby Computat Neurosci Unit, London, England","Beal, Matthew J.@State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo@State University of New York (SUNY) System::Ghahramani, Zoubin@University of London@University College London",not exist,"Independent factor analysis+Attias, H+NEURAL COMPUTATION+MAY 15 1999::A variational Bayesian framework for graphical models+Attias, H.+ADV NEURAL INFORM PR+2000::Inferring parameters and structure of latent variable models by variational bayes+Attias, H.+P 15 C UNC ART INT+1999::Variational algorithms for approximate Bayesian inference+Beal, M.+THESIS GATSBY COMPUT+2003::Variational principal components+Bishop, C.

Nested Sampling for General Bayesian Computation,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/06-BA127,2006,13,301,"Nested sampling estimates directly how the likelihood function relates to prior mass. The evidence (alternatively the marginal likelihood, marginal density of the data, or the prior predictive) is immediately obtained by summation. It is the prime result of the computation, and is accompanied by an estimate of numerical uncertainty. Samples from the posterior distribution are an optional by-product, obtainable for any temperature. The method relies on sampling within a hard constraint on likelihood value, as opposed to the softened likelihood of annealing methods. Progress depends only on the shape of the ""nested"" contours of likelihood, and not on the likelihood values. This invariance (over monotonic re-labelling) allows the method to deal with a class of phase-change problems which effectively defeat thermal annealing.","Bayesian computation,evidence,marginal likelihood,algorithm,nest,annealing,phase change,model selection",,"Skilling, John@Maximum Entropy Data Consultants Ltd, Kenmare, County Kerry, Ireland","Skilling, John@Unknow",not exist,"MULTICANONICAL ALGORITHMS FOR 1ST ORDER PHASE-TRANSITIONS+BERG, BA; NEUHAUS, T+PHYSICS LETTERS B+SEP 12 1991::HYBRID MONTE-CARLO+DUANE, S; KENNEDY, AD; PENDLETON, BJ; et al.+PHYSICS LETTERS B+SEP 3 1987::Simulating normalizing constants: From importance sampling to bridge sampling to path sampling+Gelman, A; Meng, XL+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 1998::MONTE-CARLO SAMPLING METHODS USING MARKOV CHAINS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS+HASTINGS, WK+BIOMETRIKA+1970::no title+MACKAY DJC+INFORM THEORY INFERE+2003::MACHINE CALCULATION OF THERMODYNAMIC PROPERTIES OF A SIMPLE FLUID AT SUPERCRITICAL TEMPERATURES+MCDONALD, IR; SINGER, K+JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS+1967::EQUATION OF STATE CALCULATIONS BY FAST COMPUTING MACHINES+METROPOLIS, N; ROSENBLUTH, AW; ROSENBLUTH, MN; et al.+JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS+1953::Slice sampling+Neal, RM+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2003::AN IMPROVED ACCEPTANCE PROCEDURE FOR THE HYBRID MONTE-CARLO ALGORITHM+NEAL, RM+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS+MAR 1994::no title+OHAGAN A+STATISTICIAN+1987::Exact sampling with coupled Markov chains and applications to statistical mechanics+Propp, JG; Wilson, DB+RANDOM STRUCTURES &amp; ALGORITHMS+AUG-SEP 1996::no title+RASMUSSEN CE+ADV NEURAL INFORM PR+2003::Nested sampling+Skilling, J+BAYESIAN INFERENCE AND MAXIMUM ENTROPY METHODS IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING+2004"
A Skew Item Response Model,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/06-BA128,2006,57,34,"We introduce a new skew-probit link for item response theory (IRT) by considering an accumulated skew-normal distribution. The model extends the symmetric probit-normal IRT model by considering a new item (or skewness) parameter for the item characteristic curve. A special interpretation is given for this parameter, and a latent linear structure is indicated for the model when an augmented likelihood is considered. Bayesian MCMC inference approach is developed and an efficiency study in the estimation of the model parameters is undertaken for a data set from (Tanner 1996, pg. 190) by using the notion of effective sample size (ESS) as defined in Kass et al. (1998) and the sample size per second (ESS/s) as considered in Sahu (2002) The methodology is illustrated using a data set corresponding to a Mathematical Test applied in Peruvian schools for which a sensitivity analysis of the chosen priors is conducted and also a comparison with seven parametric IRT models is conducted.

Checking for Prior-Data Conflict,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/06-BA129,2006,12,47,"Inference proceeds from ingredients chosen by the analyst and data. To validate any inferences drawn it is essential that the inputs chosen be deemed appropriate for the data. In the Bayesian context these inputs consist of both the sampling model and the prior. There are thus two possibilities for failure: the data may not have arisen from the sampling model, or the prior may place most of its mass on parameter values that are not feasible in light of the data (referred to here as prior-data conflict). Failure of the sampling model can only be fixed by modifying the model, while prior-data conflict can be overcome if sufficient data is available. We examine how to assess whether or not a prior-data conflict exists, and how to assess when its effects can be ignored for inferences. The concept of prior-data conflict is seen to lead to a partial characterization of what is meant by a noninformative prior or a noninformative sequence of priors.","prior-data conflict,sufficiency,ancillarity,hierarchically specified priors",,"Evans, Michael@Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada::Moshonov, Hadas@Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada","Evans, Michael@University of Toronto::Moshonov, Hadas@University of Toronto",not exist,"P values for composite null models+Bayarri, MJ; Berger, JO+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2000::no title+BERGER J+BAYESIAN STAT+1992::REFERENCE POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTIONS FOR BAYESIAN-INFERENCE+BERNARDO, JM+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1979::SAMPLING AND BAYES INFERENCE IN SCIENTIFIC MODELING AND ROBUSTNESS+BOX, GEP+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1980::no title+Cox, D.

"Loss Function Based Ranking in Two-Stage, Hierarchical Models",BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/06-BA130,2006,37,23,"Performance evaluations of health services providers burgeons. Similarly, analyzing spatially related health information, ranking teachers and schools, and identification of differentially expressed genes are increasing in prevalence and importance. Goals include valid and efficient ranking of units for profiling and league tables, identification of excellent and poor performers, the most differentially expressed genes, and determining ""exceedances"" (how many and which unit-specific true parameters exceed a threshold). These data and inferential goals require a hierarchical, Bayesian model that accounts for nesting relations and identifies both population values and random effects for unit-specific parameters. Furthermore, the Bayesian approach coupled with optimizing a loss function provides a framework for computing non-standard inferences such as ranks and histograms.

Estimated ranks that minimize Squared Error Loss (SEL) between the true and estimated ranks have been investigated. The posterior mean ranks minimize SEL and are ""general purpose,"" relevant to a broad spectrum of ranking goals. However, other loss functions and optimizing ranks that are tuned to application specific goals require identification and evaluation. For example, when the goal is to identify the relatively good (e.g., in the upper 10%) or relatively poor performers, a loss function that penalizes classification errors produces estimates that minimize the error rate. We construct loss functions that address this and other goals, developing a unified framework that facilitates generating candidate estimates, comparing approaches and producing data analytic performance summaries. We compare performance for a fully parametric, hierarchical model with Gaussian sampling distribution under Gaussian and a mixture of Gaussians prior distributions. We illustrate approaches via analysis of standardized mortality ratio data from the United States Renal Data System.

Results show that SEL-optimal ranks perform well over a broad class of loss functions but can be improved upon when classifying units above or below a percentile cut-point. Importantly, even optimal rank estimates can perform poorly in many real-world settings; therefore, data-analytic performance summaries should always be reported.","percentiling,Bayesian models,decision theory,operating characteristic",,"Lin, Rongheng@Natl Inst Hlth Sci, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA::Louis, Thomas A.@Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Baltimore, MD USA::Paddock, Susan M.@RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA USA::Ridgeway, Greg@RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA USA","Lin, Rongheng@Unknow::Louis, Thomas A.@Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health@Johns Hopkins University::Paddock, Susan M.@RAND Corporation::Ridgeway, Greg@RAND Corporation","Ridgeway, Greg@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6911-0804","Comparing clinical data with administrative data for producing acute myocardial infarction report cards+Austin, PC; Tu, JV+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+2006::CONTROLLING THE FALSE DISCOVERY RATE - A PRACTICAL AND POWERFUL APPROACH TO MULTIPLE TESTING+BENJAMINI, Y; HOCHBERG, Y+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1995::Improving the statistical approach to health care provider profiling+Christiansen, CL; Morris, CN+ANNALS OF INTERNAL MEDICINE+OCT 15 1997::Addressing multiple goals in evaluating region-specific risk using Bayesian methods+Conlon, EM; Louis, TA+DISEASE MAPPING AND RISK ASSESSMENT FOR PUBLIC HEALTH+1999::Longitudinal profiling of health care units based on continuous and discrete patient outcomes+Daniels, MJ; Normand, SLT+BIOSTATISTICS+JAN 2006::no title+David, H.

Multi-Scale and Hidden Resolution Time Series Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/06-BA131,2006,32,7,"We introduce a class of multi-scale models for time series. The novel framework couples standard linear models at different levels of resolution via stochastic links across scales. Jeffrey's rule of conditioning is used to revise the implied distributions and ensure that the probability distributions at the different levels are strictly compatible. This results in a new class of models for time series with three key characteristics: this class exhibits a variety of autocorrelation structures based on a parsimonious parameterization, it has the ability to combine information across levels of resolution, and it also has the capacity to emulate long memory processes. The potential applications of such multi-scale models include problems in which it is of interest to develop consistent stochastic models across time-scales and levels of resolution, in order to coherently combine and integrate information arising at different levels of resolution. Bayesian estimation based on MCMC analysis and forecasting based on simulation are developed. One application to the analysis of the flow of a river illustrates the new class of models and its utility.","Autoregressive models,Bayesian inference,Combination of multiresolution information,Jeffrey's rule of conditioning,Multi-scale stochastic models,Multi-scale time series models",,"Ferreira, Marco A.

Simple Marginally Noninformative Prior Distributions for Covariance Matrices,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/13-BA815,2013,11,30,"A family of prior distributions for covariance matrices is studied. Members of the family possess the attractive property of all standard deviation and correlation parameters being marginally noninformative for particular hyperparameter choices. Moreover, the family is quite simple and, for approximate Bayesian inference techniques such as Markov chain Monte Carlo and mean field variational Bayes, has tractability on par with the Inverse-Wishart conjugate family of prior distributions. A simulation study shows that the new prior distributions can lead to more accurate sparse covariance matrix estimation.","Bayesian inference,Gibbs sampling,Markov chain Monte Carlo,Mean field variational Bayes",,"Huang, Alan@Univ Technol, Sch Math Sci, Sydney, Broadway, Australia::Wand, M.

Multiple-Shrinkage Multinomial Probit Models with Applications to Simulating Geographies in Public Use Data,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/13-BA816,2013,36,3,"Multinomial outcomes with many levels can be challenging to model. Information typically accrues slowly with increasing sample size, yet the parameter space expands rapidly with additional covariates. Shrinking all regression parameters towards zero, as often done in models of continuous or binary response variables, is unsatisfactory, since setting parameters equal to zero in multinomial models does not necessarily imply ""no effect."" We propose an approach to modeling multinomial outcomes with many levels based on a Bayesian multinomial probit (MNP) model and a multiple shrinkage prior distribution for the regression parameters. The prior distribution encourages the MNP regression parameters to shrink toward a number of learned locations, thereby substantially reducing the dimension of the parameter space. Using simulated data, we compare the predictive performance of this model against two other recently-proposed methods for big multinomial models. The results suggest that the fully Bayesian, multiple shrinkage approach can outperform these other methods. We apply the multiple shrinkage MNP to simulating replacement values for areal identifiers, e.g., census tract indicators, in order to protect data confidentiality in public use datasets.","Confidentiality,Dirichlet process,disclosure,spatial,synthetic","BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS,IMPUTATION,MIXTURES,CHOICE,PRIORS","Burgette, Lane F.@RAND Corp, Arlington, VA USA::Reiter, Jerome P.@Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC USA","Burgette, Lane F.@RAND Corporation::Reiter, Jerome P.@Duke University",not exist,"no title+Banerjee, S.; Carlin, B.; Gelfand, A.+Hierarchical modeling and analysis for spatial data+2004::spdep: Spatial Dependence: Weighting Schemes, Statistics and Models+Bivand, R.; Anselin, L.; Berke, O.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Bernat, A.; Carvalho, M.; Chun, Y.; Dormann, C.F.; Dray, S.; Halbersma, R.; Lewin-Koh, N</span>.+R Package Version 0.5-56+2011::FERGUSON DISTRIBUTIONS VIA POLYA URN SCHEMES+BLACKWELL, D; MACQUEEN, JB+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1973::Latent Dirichlet allocation+Blei, DM; Ng, AY; Jordan, MI+JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH+MAY 15 2003::A Bayesian mixed logit-probit model for multinomial choice+Burda, Martin; Harding, Matthew; Hausman, Jerry+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+DEC 2008::Symmetric Bayesian multinomial probit models+Burgette, L.

Posterior Consistency of Bayesian Quantile Regression Based on the Misspecified Asymmetric Laplace Density,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/13-BA817,2013,15,32,"We explore an asymptotic justification for the widely used and empirically verified approach of assuming an asymmetric Laplace distribution (ALD) for the response in Bayesian Quantile Regression. Based on empirical findings, Yu and Moyeed (2001) argued that the use of ALD is satisfactory even if it is not the true underlying distribution. We provide a justification to this claim by establishing posterior consistency and deriving the rate of convergence under the ALD misspecification. Related literature on misspecified models focuses mostly on i.i.d. models which in the regression context amounts to considering i.i.d. random covariates with i.i.d. errors. We study the behavior of the posterior for the misspecified ALD model with independent but non identically distributed response in the presence of non-random covariates. Exploiting the specific form of ALD helps us derive conditions that are more intuitive and easily seen to be satisfied by a wide range of potential true underlying probability distributions for the response. Through simulations, we demonstrate our result and also find that the robustness of the posterior that holds for ALD fails for a Gaussian formulation, thus providing further support for the use of ALD models in quantile regression.","Asymmetric Laplace density,Bayesian Quantile Regression,Misspecified models,Posterior consistency","DISTRIBUTIONS,INCORRECT,BEHAVIOR,MODELS","Sriram, Karthik@Indian Inst Management Ahmedabad, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India::Ramamoorthi, R.

A Vine-copula Based Adaptive MCMC Sampler for Efficient Inference of Dynamical Systems,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/13-BA801,2013,51,6,"Statistical inference in high dimensional dynamical systems is often hindered by the unknown dependency structure of model parameters. In particular, the inference of parameterized differential equations (DEs) via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers often suffers from high proposal rejection rates and is exacerbated by strong autocorrelation structures within the Markov chains leading to poor mixing properties. In this paper, we develop a novel vine-copula based adaptive MCMC approach for efficient parameter inference in dynamical systems with strong parameter interdependence. We exploit the concept of a vine-copula decomposition of distribution densities in order to generate problem-specific proposals for a hybrid independence/random walk Metropolis-Hastings (MH) sampler. The key advantage of this approach is that the corresponding MH proposals generate independent samples from the posterior distribution more efficiently than common competitors. All copula densities can be updated during the sampling procedure for fine-tuning. The performance of our method is assessed on two small-scale examples and finally evaluated on a delay DE model for the JAK2-STAT5 signaling pathway fitted to time-resolved western blot data. We compare our copula-based approach to an independence sampler, a second-order moment-based random walk MH algorithm, and an adaptive MH sampler.","Parameter inference,Metropolis-Hastings algorithm,independence sampling,adaptive MCMC,vine,copula","DEPENDENT RANDOM-VARIABLES,METROPOLIS ALGORITHM,MARKOV-CHAINS,CONSTRUCTIONS,MODEL,DECOMPOSITION","Schmidl, Daniel@Tech Univ Munich, Inst Bioinformat & Syst Biol, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, D-80290 Munich, Germany@Tech Univ Munich, Inst Math Sci, D-80290 Munich, Germany::Czado, Claudia@Tech Univ Munich, Inst Math Sci, D-80290 Munich, Germany::Hug, Sabine@Tech Univ Munich, Inst Bioinformat & Syst Biol, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, D-80290 Munich, Germany@Tech Univ Munich, Inst Math Sci, D-80290 Munich, Germany::Theis, Fabian J.@Tech Univ Munich, Inst Bioinformat & Syst Biol, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, D-80290 Munich, Germany@Tech Univ Munich, Inst Math Sci, D-80290 Munich, Germany","Schmidl, Daniel@Technical University of Munich@Helmholtz Association@Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health::Czado, Claudia@Technical University of Munich::Hug, Sabine@Technical University of Munich@Helmholtz Association@Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health::Theis, Fabian J.@Technical University of Munich@Helmholtz Association@Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health","Czado, Claudia@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6329-5438::Theis, Fabian@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2419-1943","Pair-copula constructions of multiple dependence+Aas, Kjersti; Czado, Claudia; Frigessi, Arnoldo; et al.+INSURANCE MATHEMATICS &amp; ECONOMICS+APR 2009::An essay towards solving a problem in the doctrine of chances. by the late rev. mr. bayes, frs communicated by mr. price, in a letter to john canton, amfrs.+Bayes, M.; Price, M.+Philosophical Transactions+1763::Probability density decomposition for conditionally dependent random variables modeled by vines+Bedford, T; Cooke, RM+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE+2001::Vines - A new graphical model for dependent random variables+Bedford, T; Cooke, RM+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+AUG 2002::The metropolis algorithm+Beichl, I; Sullivan, F+COMPUTING IN SCIENCE &amp; ENGINEERING+JAN-FEB 2000::Modeling dependence with C-and D-vine copulas: The R Package CDVine+Brechmann, E.

Bayesian Inference for P (X < Y) Using Asymmetric Dependent Distributions,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/13-BA802,2013,38,5,This paper studies Bayesian inference for 0 - P(X < Y) in the case where the marginal distributions of X and Y belong to classes of distributions obtained by skewing scale mixtures of normals. We separately address the cases where X and Y are independent or dependent random variables. Dependencies between X and Y are modelled using a Gaussian copula. Noninformative benchmark and vague priors are provided for these scenarios and conditions for the existence of the posterior distribution of theta are presented. We show that the use of the Bayesian models proposed here is also valid in the presence of set observations. Examples using simulated and real data sets are presented.,"Gaussian copula,posterior existence,set observation,skewness,stress-strength model","SKEW-NORMAL DISTRIBUTION,STATISTICAL-INFERENCE,REGRESSION-ANALYSIS,RELIABILITY,MODELS,PRIORS","Rubio, Francisco J.@Univ Warwick, Dept Stat, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England::Steel, Mark F.

Asymptotics for Constrained Dirichlet Distributions,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/13-BA804,2013,26,1,"We derive the asymptotic approximation for the posterior distribution when the data are multinomial and the prior is Dirichlet conditioned on satisfying a finite set of linear equality and inequality constraints so the posterior is also Dirichlet conditioned on satisfying these same constraints. When only equality constraints are imposed, the asymptotic approximation is normal. Otherwise it is normal conditioned on satisfying the inequality constraints. In both cases the posterior is a root-n-consistent estimator of the parameter vector of the multinomial distribution. As an application we consider the constrained Polya posterior which is a non-informative stepwise Bayes posterior for finite population sampling which incorporates prior information involving auxiliary variables. The constrained Polya posterior is a root-n-consistent estimator of the population distribution, hence yields a root-n-consistent estimator of the population mean or any other differentiable function of the vector of population probabilities.","Dirichlet distribution,sample survey,constraints,Polya posterior,consistency,Bayesian inference","BAYESIAN BOOTSTRAP,FINITE POPULATIONS,ESTIMATORS","Geyer, Charles@Univ Minnesota, Sch Stat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA::Meeden, Glen@Univ Minnesota, Sch Stat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Geyer, Charles@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities::Meeden, Glen@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities",not exist,"no title+Anderson, T.W.+An Introduction to Multivariate Statistical Analysis+2003::no title+Billingsley, P.+Convergence of Probability Measures+1999::NON-PARAMETRIC BAYESIAN MODELS FOR SAMPLES FROM FINITE POPULATIONS+BINDER, DA+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1982::BOOTSTRAP METHODS FOR FINITE POPULATIONS+BOOTH, JG; BUTLER, RW; HALL, P+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1994::no title+Cramer, H.+Mathematical Methods of Statistics+1951::CALIBRATION ESTIMATORS IN SURVEY SAMPLING+DEVILLE, JC; SARNDAL, CE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1992::no title+Fuller, W.

Asymptotic Properties of Bayes Risk for the Horseshoe Prior,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/13-BA805,2013,27,14,"In this paper, we establish some optimality properties of the multiple testing rule induced by the horseshoe estimator due to Carvalho, Polson, and Scott (2010, 2009) from a Bayesian decision theoretic viewpoint. We consider the two-groups model for the data and an additive loss structure such that the total loss is equal to the number of misclassified hypotheses. We use the same asymptotic framework as Bogdan, Chakrabarti, Frommlet, and Ghosh (2011) who introduced the Bayes oracle in the context of multiple testing and provided conditions under which the Benjamini-Hochberg and Bonferroni procedures attain the risk of the Bayes oracle. We prove a similar result for the horseshoe decision rule up to O(1) with the constant in the horseshoe risk close to the constant in the oracle. We use the Full Bayes estimate of the tuning parameter tau. It is worth noting that the Full Bayes estimate cannot be replaced by the Empirical Bayes estimate, which tends to be too small.","Multiple Testing,Horseshoe Decision Rule,Asymptotic Optimality,Bayes Oracle","FALSE DISCOVERY RATE,MULTIPLE TESTING PROCEDURES,EMPIRICAL-BAYES,SELECTION,ESTIMATOR,SHRINKAGE,SPARSITY,LASSO","Datta, Jyotishka@Purdue Univ, Dept Stat, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA::Ghosh, Jayanta K.@Purdue Univ, Dept Stat, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Datta, Jyotishka@Purdue University@Purdue University System::Ghosh, Jayanta K.@Purdue University@Purdue University System","Datta, Jyotishka@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5991-5182","Adapting to unknown sparsity by controlling the false discovery rate+Abramovich, Felix; Benjamini, Yoav; Donoho, David L.; et al.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2006::Posterior consistency in linear models under shrinkage priors+Armagan, A.; Dunson, D.; Lee, J.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Bajwa, W</span>.+&lt;IT&gt;Arxiv preprint arXiv:1104.4135&lt;/IT&gt;+2011::CONTROLLING THE FALSE DISCOVERY RATE - A PRACTICAL AND POWERFUL APPROACH TO MULTIPLE TESTING+BENJAMINI, Y; HOCHBERG, Y+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1995::A comparison of the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure with some Bayesian rules for multiple testing+Bogdan, M; Ghosh, JK; Tokdar, ST.+Beyond parametrics in interdisciplinary research: Festschrift in honor of Professor Pranab K+2008::ASYMPTOTIC BAYES-OPTIMALITY UNDER SPARSITY OF SOME MULTIPLE TESTING PROCEDURES+Bogdan, Malgorzata; Chakrabarti, Arijit; Frommlet, Florian; et al.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2011::Handling sparsity via the horseshoe+Carvalho, C.; Poison, N.; Scott, J.+J MACHINE LEARNING R+2009::The horseshoe estimator for sparse signals+Carvalho, Carlos M.; Polson, Nicholas G.; Scott, James G.+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 2010::HORSESHOES IN MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCALING AND LOCAL KERNEL METHODS+Diaconis, Persi; Goel, Sharad; Holmes, Susan+ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS+SEP 2008::Large-scale simultaneous hypothesis testing: The choice of a null hypothesis+Efron, B+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2004::Microarrays, empirical Bayes and the two-groups model+Efron, Bradley+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+FEB 2008::A stochastic process approach to false discovery control+Genovese, C; Wasserman, L+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2004::Bayesian lasso regression+Hans, Chris+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 2009::Regularized optimization in statistical learning: A Bayesian perspective+Li, B; Goel, PK+STATISTICA SINICA+APR 2006::The Bayesian Lasso+Park, Trevor; Casella, George+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2008::Posterior contraction in sparse Bayesian factor models for massive covariance matrices+Pati, D.; Bhattacharya, A.; Pillai, N.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Dunson, D</span>.+&lt;IT&gt;Arxiv preprint arXiv:1206.3627&lt;/IT&gt;+2012::EXACT AND APPROXIMATE POSTERIOR MOMENTS FOR A NORMAL LOCATION PARAMETER+PERICCHI, LR; SMITH, AFM+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1992::Large-scale simultaneous testing with hypergeometric inverted-beta priors+Polson, N.; Scott, J.+&lt;IT&gt;Arxiv preprint arXiv:1010.5223&lt;/IT&gt;+2010::On the half-Cauchy prior for a global scale parameter+Polson, NG; Scott, JG.+Bayesian Anal.+2012::False discovery and false nondiscovery rates in single-step multiple testing procedures+Sarkar, SK+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 2006::BAYES AND EMPIRICAL-BAYES MULTIPLICITY ADJUSTMENT IN THE VARIABLE-SELECTION PROBLEM+Scott, James G.; Berger, James O.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+OCT 2010::Bayesian Estimation of Intensity Surfaces on the Sphere via Needlet Shrinkage and Selection+Scott, James G.+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2011::An exploration of aspects of Bayesian multiple testing+Scott, JG; Berger, JO+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+JUL 1 2006::INCONSISTENCY OF BOOTSTRAP: THE GRENANDER ESTIMATOR+Sen, Bodhisattva; Banerjee, Moulinath; Woodroofe, Michael+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+AUG 2010::The positive false discovery rate: A Bayesian interpretation and the q-value+Storey, JD+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 2003::The optimal discovery procedure: a new approach to simultaneous significance testing+Storey, John D.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2007::Finite Sample Posterior Concentration in High Dimensional Regression+Strawn, N.; Armagan, A.; Saab, R.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Carin, L.; Dunson, D.

Feedback and Modularization in a Bayesian Meta-analysis of Tree Traits Affecting Forest Dynamics,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/13-BA806,2013,72,13,"We describe a unique application of modularization in the context of a Bayesian meta-analysis of quantitative information obtained from the literature. Incomplete reporting, resulting in large amounts of missing data, is common in many meta-analyses, and, in this study, it led to poor mixing and identifiability problems in a fully Bayesian meta-analysis model. As an alternative to the full Bayesian approach, we modularized model components (e.g., modules of covariates, sample sizes, and standard errors) to prevent missing covariate data in these modules from allowing feedback that would otherwise affect parameters in the covariate module (direct feedback control) or affect covariate effects parameters in the mean model for the response (indirect feedback control). The combination of direct and indirect feedback control greatly improves mixing and facilitates convergence of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), yielding realistic pseudo-posteriors. Thus, our modularization approach allowed us to address important limitations of existing meta-analytic methods by accommodating incomplete reporting and by considering all model quantities as stochastic, including the response variable of interest (e.g., a sample mean) and sample sizes, standard errors, and all covariates, reported or not. We illustrate our approach using data summaries extracted from literature on specific leaf area (SLA) of trees, an important functional trait linked to tree growth and forest dynamics and a key parameter in models of forest responses to climate change. A hierarchical model based on taxonomic relationships allows borrowing of strength to infer SLA for 305 tree species in the United States based on information for 158 of those species. In the context of the SLA meta-analysis, we discuss problems that arise from feedback among model components and provide ecological arguments for modularization-for ""cutting feedback."" We anticipate that our approach may be applied to meta-analyses of other important tree traits and to similar meta-analytical studies in general.","cutting feedback,ecological meta-analysis,hierarchical Bayesian model,incomplete reporting,leaf traits,literature data,missing data,modularization,plant functional traits,specific leaf area,TreeTraits database,variable reporting","GLOBAL VEGETATION MODEL,LEAF-AREA,DECIDUOUS FOREST,GRAPHICAL MODELS,SHADE TOLERANCE,CLIMATE-CHANGE,GROWTH,MORPHOLOGY,CANOPY,LIGHT","Ogle, Kiona@Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA::Barber, Jarrett@Arizona State Univ, Sch Math & Stat Sci, Tempe, AZ USA::Sartor, Karla@Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Ogle, Kiona@Arizona State University::Barber, Jarrett@Arizona State University::Sartor, Karla@Harvard University",not exist,"Meta-analysis of heterogeneously reported trials assessing change from baseline+Abrams, KR; Gillies, CL; Lambert, PC+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+DEC 30 2005::Leaf size, specific leaf area and microhabitat distribution of chaparral woody plants: contrasting patterns in species level and community level analyses+Ackerly, DD; Knight, CA; Weiss, SB; et al.+OECOLOGIA+FEB 2002::The variability among populations of coho salmon in the maximum reproductive rate and depensation+Barrowman, NJ; Myers, RA; Hilborn, R; et al.+ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS+JUN 2003::A dynamic global vegetation model for use with climate models: concepts and description of simulated vegetation dynamics+Bonan, GB; Levis, S; Sitch, S; et al.+GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY+NOV 2003::Convergence assessment techniques for Markov chain Monte Carlo+Brooks, SP; Roberts, GO+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+DEC 1998::A Bayesian semiparametric model for random-effects meta-analysis+Burr, D; Doss, H+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2005::no title+Casella, G.; Berger, R.+Statistical Inference+2002::Effects of light on growth, crown architecture, and specific leaf area for naturally established Pinus contorta var latifolia and Pseudotsuga menziesii var glauca saplings+Chen, HYH; Klinka, K; Kayahara, GJ+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH+JUL 1996::Interspecific responses of planted seedlings to light availability in interior British Columbia: survival, growth, allometric patterns, and specific leaf area+Chen, HYH+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE+SEP 1997::Leaf traits in relation to crown development, light interception and growth of elite families of loblolly and slash pine+Chmura, Daniel J.; Tjoelker, Mark G.+TREE PHYSIOLOGY+MAY 2008::Semiparametric hierarchical selection models for Bayesian meta analysis+Chung, YS; Dey, DK; Jang, JH+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+2002::Bayesian meta-analysis models for microarray data: a comparative study+Conlon, E.

Full Robustness in Bayesian Modelling of a Scale Parameter,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/13-BA808,2013,11,3,"Conflicting information, arising from prior misspecification or outlying observations, may contaminate the posterior inference in Bayesian modelling. The use of densities with sufficiently heavy tails usually leads to robust posterior inference, as the influence of the conflicting information decreases with the importance of the conflict. In this paper, we study full robustness in Bayesian modelling of a scale parameter. The log-slowly, log-regularly and log-exponentially varying functions as well as log-exponential credence (LE-credence) are introduced in order to characterize the tail behaviour of a density. The asymptotic behaviour of the marginal and the posterior is described and we find that the scale parameter given the complete information converges in distribution to the scale given the non-conflicting information, as the conflicting values (outliers and/or prior's scale) tend to 0 or infinity, at any given rate. We propose a new family of densities defined on R with a large spectrum of tail behaviours, called generalized exponential power of the second form (GEP(2)), and its exponential transformation defined on (0, infinity), called log-GEP(2), which proves to be helpful for robust modelling. Practical considerations are addressed through a case of combination of experts' opinions, where non-robust and robust models are compared.","Bayesian robustness,conflicting information,log-exponentially varying functions,log-regularly varying functions,log-slowly varying functions,LE-credence,Log-GEP(2)","INFERENCE,LOCATION","Desgagne, Alain@Univ Quebec, Dept Math, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada","Desgagne, Alain@University of Quebec@University of Quebec Montreal",not exist,"Bayesian Robustness Modelling of Location and Scale Parameters+Alencar Andrade, Jose Ailton; O'Hagan, Anthony+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+DEC 2011::Bayesian Robustness Modeling Using Regularly Varying Distributions+Andrade, J.

"On the Limiting Behavior of the ""Probability of Claiming Superiority"" in a Bayesian Context",BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/13-BA809,2013,9,5,"In the context of Bayesian sample size determination in clinical trials, a quantity of interest is the marginal probability that the posterior probability of an alternative hypothesis of interest exceeds a specified threshold. This marginal probability is the same as average power; that is, the average of the power function with respect to the prior distribution when using a test based on a Bayesian rejection region. We give conditions under which this marginal probability (or average power) converges to the prior probability of the alternative hypothesis as the sample size increases. This same large sample behavior also holds for the average power of a (frequentist) consistent test. We also examine the limiting behavior of conditional average power; that is, power averaged with respect to the prior distribution conditional on the alternative hypothesis being true.","Bayesian design,probability of a successful trial,average power,Bayesian hypothesis testing,clinical trials,sample size determination","CLINICAL-TRIALS,SAMPLE-SIZE","Eaton, Morris L.@Univ Minnesota, Sch Stat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA::Muirhead, Robb J.@Unknow::Soaita, Adina I.@Pfizer Inc, Groton, CT 06340 USA","Eaton, Morris L.@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities::Muirhead, Robb J.@Unknow::Soaita, Adina I.@Pfizer",not exist,"no title+Billingsley, P.+&lt;IT&gt;Convergence of Probability Measures&lt;/IT&gt;+1968::Merging of opinions with increasing information+Blackwell, D.; Dubins, L.+&lt;IT&gt;Annals of Mathematical Statistics&lt;/IT&gt;+1962::Robust Bayesian sample size determination in clinical trials+Brutti, Pierpaolo; De Santis, Fulvio; Gubbiotti, Stefania+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUN 15 2008::Application of the theory of martingales+Doob, J.

The model considers each legislators constituency (location), the congressional session (time) of each vote, and the details (text) of each piece of legislation. The model can predict votes of new legislation from only text, while imposing smooth temporal evolution of legislator latent features, and correlation of legislators with adjacent constituencies. Additionally, the model estimates the number of latent dimensions required to represent the data. A Gibbs sampler is developed for posterior inference. The model is demonstrated as an exploratory tool of legislation and it performs well in quantitative comparisons to a traditional ideal-point model.","Factor analysis,Indian buffet process,latent Dirichlet allocation,political science,topic modeling","STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS,GRAPHICAL MODELS","Wang, Eric@USN Acad, Dept Math, Annapolis, MD 21402 USA::Salazar, Esther@Duke Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Durham, NC USA::Dunson, David@Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC USA::Carin, Lawrence@Duke Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Durham, NC USA","Wang, Eric@United States Navy@United States Naval Academy@United States Department of Defense::Salazar, Esther@Duke University::Dunson, David@Duke University::Carin, Lawrence@Duke University",not exist,"Staying informed: Supervised and semi-supervised multi-view topical analysis of ideological perspective+Ahmed, A.; Xing, E.

Flexible Bayesian Human Fecundity Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/12-BA726,2012,40,1,"Human fecundity is an issue of considerable interest for both epidemiological and clinical audiences, and is dependent upon a couple's biologic capacity for reproduction coupled with behaviors that place a couple at risk for pregnancy. Bayesian hierarchical models have been proposed to better model the conception probabilities by accounting for the acts of intercourse around the day of ovulation, i.e., during the fertile window. These models can be viewed in the framework of a generalized nonlinear model with an exponential link. However, a fixed choice of link function may not always provide the best fit, leading to potentially biased estimates for probability of conception. Motivated by this, we propose a general class of models for fecundity by relaxing the choice of the link function under the generalized nonlinear model framework. We use a sample from the Oxford Conception Study (OCS) to illustrate the utility and fit of this general class of models for estimating human conception. Our findings reinforce the need for attention to be paid to the choice of link function in modeling conception, as it may bias the estimation of conception probabilities. Various properties of the proposed models are examined and a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm was developed for implementing the Bayesian computations. The deviance information criterion measure and logarithm of pseudo marginal likelihood are used for guiding the choice of links. The supplemental material section contains technical details of the proof of the theorem stated in the paper, and contains further simulation results and analysis.","Conception,Fecundity,Generalized t-distribution,Generalized nonlinear model,Markov chain Monte Carlo,Menstrual Cycle,Posterior distribution","BINARY REGRESSION,MENSTRUAL-CYCLE,HUMAN-FERTILITY,RESPONSE DATA,CONCEPTION,FECUNDABILITY,INTERCOURSE,PREGNANCY,OVULATION,PROBABILITIES","Kim, Sungduk@Eunice Kennedy Shriver Natl Inst Child Hlth & Hum, Div Epidemiol Stat & Prevent Res, NIH, Rockville, MD USA::Sundaram, Rajeshwari@Eunice Kennedy Shriver Natl Inst Child Hlth & Hum, Div Epidemiol Stat & Prevent Res, NIH, Rockville, MD USA::Louis, Germaine M.

Nonparametric Bayesian Segmentation of a Multivariate Inhomogeneous Space-Time Poisson Process,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/12-BA727,2012,26,3,"A nonparametric Bayesian model is proposed for segmenting time-evolving multivariate spatial point process data. An inhomogeneous Poisson process is assumed, with a logistic stick-breaking process (LSBP) used to encourage piecewise-constant spatial Poisson intensities. The LSBP explicitly favors spatially contiguous segments, and infers the number of segments based on the observed data. The temporal dynamics of the segmentation and of the Poisson intensities are modeled with exponential correlation in time, implemented in the form of a first-order autoregressive model for uniformly sampled discrete data, and via a Gaussian process with an exponential kernel for general temporal sampling. We consider and compare two different inference techniques: a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler, which has relatively high computational complexity; and an approximate and efficient variational Bayesian analysis. The model is demonstrated with a simulated example and a real example of space-time crime events in Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.","Bayesian hierarchical model,spatial segmentation,temporal dynamics,Gaussian process,logistic stick breaking process,inhomogeneous Poisson process","POINT-PROCESSES,MODELS","Ding, Mingtao@Duke Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Durham, NC 27706 USA::He, Lihan@Duke Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Durham, NC 27706 USA::Dunson, David@Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC USA::Carin, Lawrence@Duke Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Durham, NC 27706 USA","Ding, Mingtao@Duke University::He, Lihan@Duke University::Dunson, David@Duke University::Carin, Lawrence@Duke University",not exist,"Using non-homogeneous Poisson models with multiple change-points to estimate the number of ozone exceedances in Mexico City+Achcar, Jorge A.; Rodrigues, Eliane R.; Tzintzun, Guadalupe+ENVIRONMETRICS+FEB 2011::Tractable nonparametric Bayesian Inference in Poisson processes with Gaussian process intensities+Adams, R.

A New Robust Regression Model for Proportions,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/12-BA728,2012,35,14,"A new regression model for proportions is presented by considering the Beta rectangular distribution proposed by Hahn (2008). This new model includes the Beta regression model introduced by Ferrari and Cribari-Neto (2004) and the variable dispersion Beta regression model introduced by Smithson and Verkuilen (2006) as particular cases. Like Branscum, Johnson, and Thurmond (2007), a Bayesian inference approach is adopted using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. Simulation studies on the influence of outliers by considering contaminated data under four perturbation patterns to generate outliers were carried out and confirm that the Beta rectangular regression model seems to be a new robust alternative for modeling proportion data and that the Beta regression model shows sensitivity to the estimation of regression coefficients, to the posterior distribution of all parameters and to the model comparison criteria considered. Furthermore, two applications are presented to illustrate the robustness of the Beta rectangular model.","Proportions,Beta regression,Bayesian estimation,link function,MCMC","BETA-REGRESSION,INFLUENCE DIAGNOSTICS,BAYESIAN-ESTIMATION,MIXTURE","Bayes, Cristian L.@Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, Dept Ciencias, Lima, Peru::Bazan, Jorge L.@Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, Dept Ciencias, Lima, Peru::Garcia, Catalina@Univ Granada, Dept Metodos Cuantitat, E-18071 Granada, Spain","Bayes, Cristian L.@Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru::Bazan, Jorge L.@Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru::Garcia, Catalina@University of Granada","garcia, catalina@M-9019-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1622-3877::Bazan, Jorge@D-7849-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3918-8795::Bayes, Cristian@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0474-7921","no title+Barnett, V.; Lewis, T.+Outliers in Statistical Data+1995::Bayesian Estimation of the Logistic Positive Exponent IRT Model+Bolfarine, Heleno; Luis Bazan, Jorge+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL STATISTICS+DEC 2010::Practical Bayesian estimation of a finite beta mixture through gibbs sampling and its applications+Bouguila, N; Ziou, D; Monga, E+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+JUN 2006::Bayesian beta regression: Applications to household expenditure data and genetic distance between foot-and-mouth disease viruses+Branscum, Adam J.; Johnson, Wesley O.; Thurmond, Mark C.+AUSTRALIAN &amp; NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+SEP 2007::Discussion on the paper by Spiegelhalter, Best, Carlin and van der Linde+Brooks, SP+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2002::Estimation of models with beta-distributed dependent variables: A replication and extension of Paolino (2001)+Buckley, J.+Political Analysis+2002::Bayesian Case Influence Diagnostics for Survival Models+Cho, Hyunsoon; Ibrahim, Joseph G.; Sinha, Debajyoti; et al.+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2009::no title+Congdon, P.+Applied Bayesian modelling+2003::Beta Regression in R+Cribari-Neto, Francisco; Zeileis, Achim+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL SOFTWARE+APR 2010::Influence diagnostics in beta regression+Espinheira, Patricia L.; Ferrari, Silvia L.

Bayesian Graphical Lasso Models and Efficient Posterior Computation,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/12-BA729,2012,32,26,"Recently, the graphical lasso procedure has become popular in estimating Gaussian graphical models. In this paper, we introduce a fully Bayesian treatment of graphical lasso models. We first investigate the graphical lasso prior that has been relatively unexplored. Using data augmentation, we develop a simple but highly efficient block Gibbs sampler for simulating covariance matrices. We then generalize the Bayesian graphical lasso to the Bayesian adaptive graphical lasso. Finally, we illustrate and compare the results from our approach to those obtained using the standard graphical lasso procedures for real and simulated data. In terms of both covariance matrix estimation and graphical structure learning, the Bayesian adaptive graphical lasso appears to be the top overall performer among a range of frequentist and Bayesian methods.","Adaptive graphical lasso,Block Gibbs sampler,Constrained parameter spaces,Covariance matrix estimation,Double-exponential distribution,Graphical lasso","COVARIANCE MATRICES,NORMAL-DISTRIBUTIONS,SCALE MIXTURES,SELECTION,LIKELIHOOD,REGRESSION,SHRINKAGE","Wang, Hao@Univ S Carolina, Dept Stat, Columbia, SC 29208 USA","Wang, Hao@University of South Carolina@University of South Carolina System@University of South Carolina Columbia",not exist,"SCALE MIXTURES OF NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS+ANDREWS, DF; MALLOWS, CL+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1974::Generalized double Pareto shrinkage+Armagan, A.; Dunson, D.; Lee, J.+Statistica Sinica+2012::Monte Carlo method for computing the marginal likelihood in nondecomposable Gaussian graphical models+Atay-Kayis, A; Massam, H+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 2005::Model selection through sparse maximum likelihood estimation for multivariate Gaussian or binary data+Banerjee, Onureena; El Ghaoui, Laurent; d'Aspremont, Alexandre+JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH+MAR 2008::Modeling covariance matrices in terms of standard deviations and correlations, with application to shrinkage+Barnard, J; McCulloch, R; Meng, XL+STATISTICA SINICA+OCT 2000::The horseshoe estimator for sparse signals+Carvalho, Carlos M.; Polson, Nicholas G.; Scott, James G.+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 2010::Shrinkage estimators for covariance matrices+Daniels, MJ; Kass, RE+BIOMETRICS+DEC 2001::Nonconjugate Bayesian estimation of covariance matrices and its use in hierarchical models+Daniels, MJ; Kass, RE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1999::HYPER MARKOV LAWS IN THE STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS OF DECOMPOSABLE GRAPHICAL MODELS+DAWID, AP; LAURITZEN, SL+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+SEP 1993::NETWORK EXPLORATION VIA THE ADAPTIVE LASSO AND SCAD PENALTIES+Fan, Jianqing; Feng, Yang; Wu, Yichao+ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS+JUN 2009::Sparse inverse covariance estimation with the graphical lasso+Friedman, Jerome; Hastie, Trevor; Tibshirani, Robert+BIOSTATISTICS+JUL 2008::Inference with normal-gamma prior distributions in regression problems+Griffin, Jim E.; Brown, Philip J.+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2010::Joint estimation of multiple graphical models+Guo, Jian; Levina, Elizaveta; Michailidis, George; et al.+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 2011::Bayesian lasso regression+Hans, Chris+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 2009::Experiments in stochastic computation for high-dimensional graphical models+Jones, B; Carvalho, C; Dobra, A; et al.+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+NOV 2005::Bayesian covariance lasso+Khondker, Z.; Zhu, H.; Chu, H.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Lin, W.; Ibrahim, J</span>.+Statistics and Its Interface+2012::Penalized Regression, Standard Errors, and Bayesian Lassos+Kyung, Minjung; Gill, Jeff; Ghosh, Malay; et al.+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2010::The Bayesian Elastic Net+Li, Qing; Lin, Nan+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2010::Bayesian correlation estimation+Liechty, JC; Liechty, MW; Muller, P+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 2004::The Shadow Prior+Liechty, Merrill W.; Liechty, John C.; Mueller, Peter+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+JUN 2009::Sparse Gaussian Graphical Models with Unknown Block Structure+Marlin, B.

On the Half-Cauchy Prior for a Global Scale Parameter,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/12-BA730,2012,23,56,"This paper argues that the half-Cauchy distribution should replace the inverse-Gamma distribution as a default prior for a top-level scale parameter in Bayesian hierarchical models, at least for cases where a proper prior is necessary. Our arguments involve a blend of Bayesian and frequentist reasoning, and are intended to complement the case made by Gelman (2006) in support of folded-t priors. First, we generalize the half-Cauchy prior to the wider class of hypergeometric inverted-beta priors. We derive expressions for posterior moments and marginal densities when these priors are used for a top-level normal variance in a Bayesian hierarchical model. We go on to prove a proposition that, together with the results for moments and marginals, allows us to characterize the frequentist risk of the Bayes estimators under all global-shrinkage priors in the class. These results, in turn, allow us to study the frequentist properties of the half-Cauchy prior versus a wide class of alternatives. The half-Cauchy occupies a sensible middle ground within this class: it performs well near the origin, but does not lead to drastic compromises in other parts of the parameter space. This provides an alternative, classical justification for the routine use of this prior. We also consider situations where the underlying mean vector is sparse, where we argue that the usual conjugate choice of an inverse-gamma prior is particularly inappropriate, and can severely distort inference. Finally, we summarize some open issues in the specification of default priors for scale terms in hierarchical models.","hierarchical models,normal scale mixtures,shrinkage",BAYES MINIMAX ESTIMATORS,"Polson, Nicholas G.@Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL USA::Scott, James G.@Univ Texas Austin, McCombs Sch Business, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Polson, Nicholas G.@Unknow::Scott, James G.@University of Texas Austin@University of Texas System",not exist,"no title+no author+Handbook of Mathematical Functions With Formulas, Graphs, and Mathematical Tables+1964::A ROBUST GENERALIZED BAYES ESTIMATOR AND CONFIDENCE REGION FOR A MULTIVARIATE NORMAL-MEAN+BERGER, J+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1980::The horseshoe estimator for sparse signals+Carvalho, Carlos M.; Polson, Nicholas G.; Scott, James G.+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 2010::On the construction of Bayes minimax estimators+Fourdrinier, D; Strawderman, WE; Wells, MT+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 1998::Prior distributions for variance parameters in hierarchical models(Comment on an Article by Browne and Draper)+Gelman, Andrew+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2006::Improved minimax predictive densities under Kullback-Leibler loss+George, EI; Liang, F; Xu, XY+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 2006::Finance and economics discussion series: A generalization generalized beta distributions+Gordy, M.

Invariant Conjugate Analysis for Exponential Families,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/12-BA731,2012,27,2,"There are several ways to parameterize a distribution belonging to an exponential family, each one leading to a different Bayesian analysis of the data under standard conjugate priors. To overcome this problem, we propose a new class of conjugate priors which is invariant with respect to smooth reparameterization. This class of priors contains the Jeffreys prior as a special case, according to the value of the hyperparameters. Moreover, these conjugate distributions coincide with the posterior distributions resulting from a Jeffreys prior. Then these priors appear naturally when several datasets are analyzed sequentially and when the Jeffreys prior is chosen for the first dataset. We apply our approach to inverse Gaussian models and propose full invariant analyses of three datasets.","Bayesian inference,conjugate prior,exponential family,inverse Gaussian distribution,Jeffreys prior,sequential analysis","INVERSE GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTION,QUADRATIC VARIANCE FUNCTIONS,REFERENCE PRIORS,MODEL,PARAMETERIZATIONS,DISTRIBUTIONS","Druilhet, Pierre@Univ Clermont Ferrand, Dept Math, Aubiere, France::Pommeret, Denys@Inst Math Luminy, Marseille, France","Druilhet, Pierre@Unknow::Pommeret, Denys@University of Aix-Marseille","Druilhet, Pierre@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7250-9856","BAYESIAN RESULTS FOR THE INVERSE GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTION WITH AN APPLICATION+BANERJEE, AK; BHATTACHARYYA, GK+TECHNOMETRICS+1979::no title+Barndorff-Nielsen, OE.+Information and exponential families in statistical theory+1978::no title+Chhikara, R.; Folks, L.+The Inverse Gaussian Distribution: Theory, Methodology and Applications+1989::INVERSE GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTION AS A LIFETIME MODEL+CHHIKARA, RS; FOLKS, JL+TECHNOMETRICS+1977::Reference priors for exponential families with simple quadratic variance function+Consonni, G; Veronese, P; Gutierrez-Pena, E+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+FEB 2004::CONJUGATE PRIORS FOR EXPONENTIAL-FAMILIES HAVING QUADRATIC VARIANCE FUNCTIONS+CONSONNI, G; VERONESE, P+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1992::no title+Cox, D.

A Bayesian Method for Estimating Evolutionary History,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/12-BA732,2012,58,2,"Phylogeography is the study of evolutionary history among populations in a species associated with geographic genetic variation. This paper examines the phylogeography of three African gorilla subspecies based on two types of DNA sequence data. One type is HV1, the first hyper-variable region in the control region of the mitochondrial genome. The other type is nuclear mitochondrial DNA (Numt DNA), which results from the introgression of a copy of HV1 from the mitochondrial genome into the nuclear genome. Numt and HV1 sequences evolve independently when in different organelles, but they share a common evolutionary history at the same locus in the mitochondrial genome prior to introgression. This study estimates the evolutionary history of gorilla populations in terms of population divergence times and effective population sizes. Also, this study estimates the number of introgression events. The estimates are obtained in a Bayesian framework using novel Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The method is based on a hybrid coalescent process that combines separate coalescent processes for HV1 and Numt sequences along with a transfer model for introgression events within a single population tree. This Bayesian method for the analysis of Numt and HV1 sequences is the first approach specifically designed to model the evolutionary history of homologous multi-locus sequences within a population tree framework. The data analysis reveals highly discordant estimates of the divergence time between eastern and western gorilla populations for HV1 and Numt sequences. The discordant east-west split times are evidence of male-mediated gene flow between east and west long after female gorillas stopped this migration. In addition, the analysis estimates multiple independent introgression events.","divergence time,Mitochondrial sequence,HV1,Numt,Introgression,Homologous sequences,Coalescence,Phylogeography,Population genetics,Phylogeny","SPECIES DIVERGENCE TIMES,GORILLA-GORILLA-GORILLA,MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA,MOLECULAR CLOCK,MODERN HUMANS,Y-CHROMOSOME,NUCLEAR INSERTIONS,GENETIC DIVERSITY,POPULATION-SIZE,COMMON ANCESTOR","Kim, Joungyoun@Seoul Natl Univ, Canc Res Inst, Seoul 151, South Korea::Anthony, Nicola M.@Univ New Orleans, Dept Biol Sci, New Orleans, LA USA::Larget, Bret R.@Univ Wisconsin, Dept Stat, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Kim, Joungyoun@Seoul National University::Anthony, Nicola M.@University of Louisiana System@University of New Orleans::Larget, Bret R.@University of Wisconsin System@University of Wisconsin Madison",not exist,"Distinguishing gorilla mitochondrial sequences from nuclear integrations and PCR recombinants: Guidelines for their diagnosis in complex sequence databases+Anthony, Nicola M.;

Bayesian Estimation of Log-Normal Means with Finite Quadratic Expected Loss,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/12-BA733,2012,20,7,"The log-normal distribution is a popular model in biostatistics and other fields of statistics. Bayesian inference on the mean and median of the distribution is problematic because, for many popular choices of the prior for the variance (on the log-scale) parameter, the posterior distribution has no finite moments, leading to Bayes estimators with infinite expected loss for the most common choices of the loss function. We propose a generalized inverse Gaussian prior for the variance parameter, that leads to a log-generalized hyperbolic posterior, for which it is easy to calculate quantiles and moments, provided that they exist. We derive the constraints on the prior parameters that yield finite posterior moments of order r. We investigate the choice of prior parameters leading to Bayes estimators with optimal frequentist mean square error. For the estimation of the lognormal mean we show, using simulation, that the Bayes estimator under quadratic loss compares favorably in terms of frequentist mean square error to known estimators.","Bayes estimators,generalized hyperbolic distribution,generalized inverse gamma distribution,Bessel functions","INVERSE GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTIONS,INFERENCE,MODELS","Fabrizi, Enrico@Univ Cattolica, DISES, Piacenza, Italy::Trivisano, Carlo@Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Sci Stat P Fortunati, I-40126 Bologna, Italy","Fabrizi, Enrico@Catholic University of the Sacred Heart::Trivisano, Carlo@University of Bologna","FABRIZI, ENRICO@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2504-7043","no title+Abramowitz, A.; Segun, I.

The Discrete Infinite Logistic Normal Distribution,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/12-BA734,2012,49,13,"We present the discrete infinite logistic normal distribution (DILN), a Bayesian nonparametric prior for mixed membership models. DILN generalizes the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) to model correlation structure between the weights of the atoms at the group level. We derive a representation of DILN as a normalized collection of gamma-distributed random variables and study its statistical properties. We derive a variational inference algorithm for approximate posterior inference. We apply DILN to topic modeling of documents and study its empirical performance on four corpora, comparing performance with the HDP and the correlated topic model (CTM). To compute with large-scale data, we develop a stochastic variational inference algorithm for DILN and compare with similar algorithms for HDP and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) on a collection of 350,000 articles from Nature.","mixed-membership models,Dirichlet process,Gaussian process","DIRICHLET PROCESS,SAMPLING METHODS,INFERENCE,MODELS,PRIORS","Paisley, John@Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept EECS, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA::Wang, Chong@Princeton Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA::Blei, David M.@Princeton Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Paisley, John@University of California System@University of California Berkeley::Wang, Chong@Princeton University::Blei, David M.@Princeton University",not exist,"Mixed Membership Stochastic Blockmodels+Airoldi, Edoardo M.; Blei, David M.; Fienberg, Stephen E.; et al.+JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH+SEP 2008::THE STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS OF COMPOSITIONAL DATA+AITCHISON, J+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1982::Sparse variational analysis of linear mixed models for large data sets+Armagan, Artin; Dunson, David+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+AUG 2011::On smoothing and inference for topic models+Asuncion, A.; Welling, M; Smyth, P.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Teh, Y.

Bayesian Dose Finding for Combined Drugs with Discrete and Continuous Doses,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/12-BA735,2012,21,1,"The trend of treating patients with combined drugs has grown in cancer clinical trials. Often, evaluating the synergism of multiple drugs is the primary motivation for such drug-combination studies. To enhance patient response, a new agent is often investigated together with an existing standard of care (SOC) agent. Often, a certain amount of dosage of the SOC is administered in order to maintain at least some therapeutic effects in patients. For clinical trials involving a continuous-dose SOC and a discrete-dose agent, we propose a two-stage Bayesian adaptive dose-finding design. The first stage takes a continual reassessment method to locate the appropriate dose for the discrete-dose agent while fixing the continuous-dose SOC at the minimal therapeutic dose. In the second stage, we make a fine dose adjustment by calibrating the continuous dose to achieve the target toxicity rate as closely as possible. Dose escalation or de-escalation is based on the posterior estimates of the joint toxicity probabilities of combined doses. As the toxicity data accumulate during the trial, we adaptively assign each cohort of patients to the most appropriate dose combination. We conduct extensive simulation studies to examine the operating characteristics of the proposed two-stage design and demonstrate the design's good performance with practical scenarios.","Bayesian adaptive design,Combined drugs,Continual reassessment method,Maximum tolerated dose,Phase I trial,Toxicity probability,Two-stage design","PHASE-I TRIALS,REASSESSMENT METHOD,CLINICAL-TRIALS,DESIGN,CANCER,ONCOLOGY,IMPROVEMENTS,COMBINATIONS,EXTENSION,AGENTS","Huo, Lin@Novartis Pharmaceut, E Hanover, NJ USA::Yuan, Ying@Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Biostat, Houston, TX 77030 USA::Yin, Guosheng@Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Huo, Lin@Novartis::Yuan, Ying@UTMD Anderson Cancer Center@University of Texas System::Yin, Guosheng@University of Hong Kong",not exist,"A Hierarchical Bayesian Design for Phase I Trials of Novel Combinations of Cancer Therapeutic Agents+Braun, Thomas M.; Wang, Shufang+BIOMETRICS+SEP 2010::no title+Chevret, S.+Statistical Methods for Dose-finding Experiments+2006::SOME PRACTICAL IMPROVEMENTS IN THE CONTINUAL REASSESSMENT METHOD FOR PHASE-I STUDIES+GOODMAN, SN; ZAHURAK, ML; PIANTADOSI, S+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUN 15 1995::Adaptive design improvements in the continual reassessment method for phase I studies+Heyd, JM; Carlin, BP+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUN 15 1999::The continual reassessment method and its applications: a Bayesian methodology for phase I cancer clinical trials+Ishizuka, N; Ohashi, Y+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+SEP 15 2001::USING THE TOLERABLE-DOSE DIAGRAM IN THE DESIGN OF PHASE-I COMBINATION CHEMOTHERAPY TRIALS+KORN, EL; SIMON, R+JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY+APR 1993::Continual reassessment methods in phase I trials of the combination of two drugs in oncology+Kramar, A; Lebecq, A; Candalh, E+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUL 30 1999::Optimal doses of paclitaxel and carboplatin combination chemotherapy for ovarian cancer: A phase I modified continual reassessment method study+Kuzuya, Kazuo; Ishikawa, Hisatake; Nakanishi, Toru; et al.+International Journal of Clinical Oncology+December, 2001::An extension of the continual reassessment method using decision theory+Leung, DHY; Wang, YG+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JAN 15 2002::AN EXTENSION OF THE CONTINUAL REASSESSMENT METHODS USING A PRELIMINARY UP-AND-DOWN DESIGN IN A DOSE-FINDING STUDY IN CANCER-PATIENTS, IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE A GREATER RANGE OF DOSES+MOLLER, S+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+MAY 15 1995::CONTINUAL REASSESSMENT METHOD - A PRACTICAL DESIGN FOR PHASE-1 CLINICAL-TRIALS IN CANCER+OQUIGLEY, J; PEPE, M; FISHER, L+BIOMETRICS+MAR 1990::Practical implementation of a modified continual reassessment method for dose-finding trials+Piantadosi, S; Fisher, JD; Grossman, S+CANCER CHEMOTHERAPY AND PHARMACOLOGY+MAY 1998::DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF PHASE-I CLINICAL-TRIALS+STORER, BE+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1989::Dose-finding with two agents in phase I oncology trials+Thall, PF; Millikan, RE; Mueller, P; et al.+BIOMETRICS+SEP 2003::Continual Reassessment Method for Partial Ordering+Wages, Nolan A.; Conaway, Mark R.; O'Quigley, John+BIOMETRICS+DEC 2011::Two-dimensional dose finding in discrete dose space+Wang, K; Ivanova, A+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2005::no title+Yin,, G.+Clinical Trial Design: Bayesian and Frequentist Adaptive Methods+2012::Bayesian Model Averaging Continual Reassessment Method in Phase I Clinical Trials+Yin, Guosheng; Yuan, Ying+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2009::Bayesian dose finding in oncology for drug combinations by copula regression+Yin, Guosheng; Yuan, Ying+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2009::Sequential continual reassessment method for two-dimensional dose finding+Yuan, Ying; Yin, Guosheng+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+NOV 29 2008::The continual reassessment method for multiple toxicity grades: A Bayesian quasi-likelihood approach+Yuan, Z.; Chappell, R.; Bailey, H.+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2007"
Combining Expert Opinions in Prior Elicitation,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/12-BA717,2012,88,33,We consider the problem of combining opinions from different experts in an explicitly model-based way to construct a valid subjective prior in a Bayesian statistical approach. We propose a generic approach by considering a hierarchical model accounting for various sources of variation as well as accounting for potential dependence between experts. We apply this approach to two problems. The first problem deals with a food risk assessment problem involving modelling dose-response for Listeria monocytogenes contamination of mice. Two hierarchical levels of variation are considered (between and within experts) with a complex mathematical situation due to the use of an indirect probit regression. The second concerns the time taken by PhD students to submit their thesis in a particular school. It illustrates a complex situation where three hierarchical levels of variation are modelled but with a simpler underlying probability distribution (log-Normal).,"Bayesian statistics,Hierarchical model,Random effects,Risk assessment","MODELS,RECONCILIATION,DISTRIBUTIONS,PERSPECTIVE,KNOWLEDGE,JUDGMENT,SCIENCE","Albert, Isabelle@AgroParisTech, Met Risk, INRA, UR1204, Paris, France::Donnet, Sophie@Unknow::Guihenneuc-Jouyaux, Chantal@Univ Paris 05, Fac Sci Pharmaceut & Biol, EA 4064, Paris, France::Low-Choy, Samantha@Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Math Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia@Australia & Cooperat Res Ctr Natl Plant Biosecur, Canberra, ACT, Australia::Mengersen, Kerrie@Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Math Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia::Rousseau, Judith@Univ Paris 09, CREST ENSAE, Paris, France@Univ Paris 09, CEREMADE, F-75775 Paris, France","Albert, Isabelle@Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA)@AgroParisTech@Universite Paris Saclay (ComUE)::Donnet, Sophie@Unknow::Guihenneuc-Jouyaux, Chantal@University of Paris Descartes@Universite Sorbonne Paris Cite-USPC (ComUE)::Low-Choy, Samantha@Queensland University of Technology (QUT)::Mengersen, Kerrie@Queensland University of Technology (QUT)::Rousseau, Judith@PSL Research University Paris (ComUE)@ENSAE ParisTech@Universite Paris Saclay (ComUE)@Universite Paris-Dauphine","Low Choy, Samantha@A-7161-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1722-4428::Mengersen, Kerrie@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8625-9168","Quantitative risk assessment from farm to fork and beyond: A global Bayesian approach concerning food-borne diseases+Albert, Isabelle; Grenier, Emmanuel; Denis, Jean-Baptiste; et al.+RISK ANALYSIS+APR 2008::The interplay of Bayesian and Frequentist Analysis+Bayarri, M.

Bayesian Matching of Unlabeled Point Sets Using Procrustes and Configuration Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/12-BA718,2012,45,9,"The problem of matching unlabeled point sets using Bayesian inference is considered. Two recently proposed models for the likelihood are compared, based on the Procrustes size-and-shape and the full configuration. Bayesian inference is carried out for matching point sets using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. An improvement to the existing Procrustes algorithm is proposed which improves convergence rates, using occasional large jumps in the burn-in period. The Procrustes and configuration methods are compared in a simulation study and using real data,where it is of interest to estimate the strengths of matches between protein binding sites. The performance of both methods is generally quite similar, and a connection between the two models is made using a Laplace approximation.","Gibbs,Markov chain Monte Carlo,Metropolis-Hastings,molecule,protein,Procrustes,size,shape","HIERARCHICAL-MODELS,BIOINFORMATICS,ALIGNMENT,SHAPE","Kenobi, Kim@Univ Nottingham, Sch Biosci, Nottingham NG7 2RD, Leics, England::Dryden, Ian L.@Univ S Carolina, Dept Stat, Columbia, SC 29208 USA","Kenobi, Kim@University of Nottingham::Dryden, Ian L.@University of South Carolina Columbia@University of South Carolina@University of South Carolina System","Dryden, Ian@C-8742-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4900-3571","Statistical analysis of unlabeled point sets: comparing molecules in cheminformatics+Dryden, I.

Simulation-based Regularized Logistic Regression,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/12-BA719,2012,37,12,"In this paper, we develop a simulation-based framework for regularized logistic regression, exploiting two novel results for scale mixtures of normals. By carefully choosing a hierarchical model for the likelihood by one type of mixture, and implementing regularization with another, we obtain new MCMC schemes with varying efficiency depending on the data type (binary v. binomial, say) and the desired estimator (maximum likelihood, maximum a posteriori, posterior mean). Advantages of our omnibus approach include flexibility, computational efficiency, applicability in p >> n settings, uncertainty estimates, variable selection, and assessing the optimal degree of regularization. We compare our methodology to modern alternatives on both synthetic and real data. An R package called reglogit is available on CRAN.","logistic regression,regularization,z-distributions,data augmentation,classification,Gibbs sampling,lasso,variance-mean mixtures,Bayesian shrinkage","CHAIN MONTE-CARLO,NORMAL-DISTRIBUTIONS,SCALE MIXTURES,MODELS,INFERENCE,OPTIMIZATION,LIKELIHOOD,SHRINKAGE,VARIABLES,SELECTION","Gramacy, Robert B.@Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL USA::Polson, Nicholas G.@Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL USA","Gramacy, Robert B.@Unknow::Polson, Nicholas G.@Unknow",not exist,"SCALE MIXTURES OF NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS+ANDREWS, DF; MALLOWS, CL+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1974::UCI machine learning repository+Asuncion, A; Newman, D.+UCI MACHINE LEARNING+2007::NORMAL VARIANCE MEAN MIXTURES AND Z-DISTRIBUTIONS+BARNDORFFNIELSEN, O; KENT, J; SORENSEN, M+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+1982::no title+Bernstein, DS.+Matrix Mathematics+2005::no title+BOX, G.

Prior Effective Sample Size in Conditionally Independent Hierarchical Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/12-BA720,2012,12,9,"Prior effective sample size (ESS) of a Bayesian parametric model was defined by Morita, et al. (2008, Biometrics, 64, 595-602). Starting with an epsilon-information prior defined to have the same means and correlations as the prior but to be vague in a suitable sense, the ESS is the required sample size to obtain a hypothetical posterior very close to the prior. In this paper, we present two alternative definitions for the prior ESS that are suitable for a conditionally independent hierarchical model. The two definitions focus on either the first level prior or second level prior. The proposed methods are applied to important examples to verify that each of the two types of prior ESS matches the intuitively obvious answer where it exists. We illustrate the method with applications to several motivating examples, including a single-arm clinical trial to evaluate treatment response probabilities across different disease subtypes, a dose-finding trial based on toxicity in this setting, and a multicenter randomized trial of treatments for affective disorders.","Bayesian hierarchical model,Conditionally independent hierarchical model,Computationally intensive methods,Effective sample size,Epsilon-information prior","TRIALS,CANCER","Morita, Satoshi@Yokohama City Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Biostat & Epidemiol, Yokohama, Kanagawa 232, Japan::Thall, Peter F.@Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Biostat, Houston, TX 77030 USA@Univ Texas Austin, Dept Math, Austin, TX 78712 USA::Mueller, Peter@Unknow","Morita, Satoshi@Yokohama City University::Thall, Peter F.@UTMD Anderson Cancer Center@University of Texas Austin@University of Texas System::Mueller, Peter@Unknow",not exist,"The role of meta-analysis in the regulatory process for foods, drugs, and devices+Berlin, JA; Colditz, GA+JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 3 1999::no title+no author+Bayesian Biostatistics+1996::Bayesian Models for Categorical Data+Congdon, P+BAYESIAN MODELS FOR CATEGORICAL DATA+2005::no title+Gelman, A; Carlin, JB; Sterns, HS<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Rubin, DB</span>.+Bayesian Data Analysis+2004::Prior distributions for variance parameters in hierarchical models(Comment on an Article by Browne and Draper)+Gelman, Andrew+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2006::A BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS OF INSTITUTIONAL EFFECTS IN A MULTICENTER CANCER CLINICAL-TRIAL+GRAY, RJ+BIOMETRICS+MAR 1994::APPROXIMATE BAYESIAN-INFERENCE IN CONDITIONALLY INDEPENDENT HIERARCHICAL-MODELS (PARAMETRIC EMPIRICAL BAYES MODELS)+KASS, RE; STEFFEY, D+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1989::Determining the effective sample size of a parametric prior+Morita, Satoshi; Thall, Peter F.; Mueller, Peter+BIOMETRICS+JUN 2008::CONTINUAL REASSESSMENT METHOD - A PRACTICAL DESIGN FOR PHASE-1 CLINICAL-TRIALS IN CANCER+OQUIGLEY, J; PEPE, M; FISHER, L+BIOMETRICS+MAR 1990::BAYESIAN APPROACHES TO RANDOMIZED TRIALS+SPIEGELHALTER, DJ; FREEDMAN, LS; PARMAR, MKB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1994::no title+STANGL DK+BAYESIAN BIOSTATISTI+1996::Hierarchical Bayesian approaches to phase II trials in diseases with multiple subtypes+Thall, PF; Wathen, JK; Bekele, BN; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+MAR 15 2003"

Commensurate Priors for Incorporating Historical Information in Clinical Trials Using General and Generalized Linear Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/12-BA722,2012,33,37,"Assessing between-study variability in the context of conventional random-effects meta-analysis is notoriously difficult when incorporating data from only a small number of historical studies. In order to borrow strength, historical and current data are often assumed to be fully homogeneous, but this can have drastic consequences for power and Type I error if the historical information is biased. In this paper, we propose empirical and fully Bayesian modifications of the commensurate prior model (Hobbs et al. 2011) extending Pocock (1976), and evaluate their frequentist and Bayesian properties for incorporating patient-level historical data using general and generalized linear mixed regression models. Our proposed commensurate prior models lead to preposterior admissible estimators that facilitate alternative bias-variance trade-offs than those offered by pre-existing methodologies for incorporating historical data from a small number of historical studies. We also provide a sample analysis of a colon cancer trial comparing time-to-disease progression using a Weibull regression model.","clinical trials,historical controls,meta-analysis,Bayesian analysis,survival analysis,correlated data","METASTATIC COLORECTAL-CANCER,RICHLY-PARAMETERIZED MODELS,MIXED MODELS,VARIANCE-COMPONENTS,HIERARCHICAL-MODELS,PRIOR DISTRIBUTIONS,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,BAYESIAN METHODS,INFERENCE,FLUOROURACIL","Hobbs, Brian P.@Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Biostat, Houston, TX 77030 USA::Sargent, Daniel J.@Mayo Clin, Dept Hlth Sci Res, Rochester, MN USA::Carlin, Bradley P.@Univ Minnesota, Div Biostat, Minneapolis, MN USA","Hobbs, Brian P.@UTMD Anderson Cancer Center@University of Texas System::Sargent, Daniel J.@Mayo Clinic::Carlin, Bradley P.@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities","Sargent, Daniel@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2684-4741","BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS OF BINARY AND POLYCHOTOMOUS RESPONSE DATA+ALBERT, JH; CHIB, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1993::APPROXIMATE INFERENCE IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS+BRESLOW, NE; CLAYTON, DG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::A comparison of Bayesian and likelihood-based methods for fitting multilevel models+Browne, William J.; Draper, David+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2006::Approaches for statistical inference+Carlin, Bradley P.; Louis, Thomas A.+BAYESIAN METHODS FOR DATA ANALYSIS, THIRD EDITION+2009::Partitioning Degrees of Freedom in Hierarchical and Other Richly Parameterized Models+Cui, Yue; Hodges, James S.; Kong, Xiaoxiao; et al.+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 2010::A prior for the variance in hierarchical models+Daniels, MJ+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+SEP 1999::Marginal maximum a posteriori estimation using Markov chain Monte Carlo+Doucet, A; Godsill, SJ; Robert, CP+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+JAN 2002::STOPPING RULES FOR CLINICAL-TRIALS INCORPORATING CLINICAL OPINION+FREEDMAN, LS; LOWE, D; MACASKILL, P+BIOMETRICS+1984::A Case for Robust Bayesian Priors with Applications to Clinical Trials+Fuquene, Jairo A.; Cook, John D.; Pericchi, Luis R.+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2009::no title+Gelman, A; Carlin, JB; Sterns, HS<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Rubin, DB</span>.+Bayesian Data Analysis+2004::Prior distributions for variance parameters in hierarchical models(Comment on an Article by Browne and Draper)+Gelman, Andrew+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2006::CONSTRAINED MONTE-CARLO MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD FOR DEPENDENT DATA+GEYER, CJ; THOMPSON, EA+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1992::A Randomized controlled trial of fluorouracil plus leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin combinations in patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer+Goldberg, RM; Sargent, DJ; Morton, RF; et al.+JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY+JAN 1 2004::Hierarchical Commensurate and Power Prior Models for Adaptive Incorporation of Historical Information in Clinical Trials+Hobbs, Brian P.; Carlin, Bradley P.; Mandrekar, Sumithra J.; et al.+BIOMETRICS+SEP 2011::Counting degrees of freedom in hierarchical and other richly-parameterised models+Hodges, JS; Sargent, DJ+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 2001::no title+Ibrahim, J.

Perfect Simulation for Mixtures with Known and Unknown Number of Components,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/12-BA723,2012,26,2,"We propose and develop a novel and effective perfect sampling methodology for simulating from posteriors corresponding to mixtures with either known (fixed) or unknown number of components. For the latter we consider the Dirichlet process-based mixture model developed by these authors, and show that our ideas are applicable to conjugate, and importantly, to non-conjugate cases. As to be expected, and as we show, perfect sampling for mixtures with known number of components can be achieved with much less effort with a simplified version of our general methodology, whether or not conjugate or non-conjugate priors are used. While no special assumption is necessary in the conjugate set-up for our theory to work, we require the assumption of compact parameter space in the non-conjugate set-up. However, we argue, with appropriate analytical, simulation, and real data studies as support, that such compactness assumption is not unrealistic and is not an impediment in practice. Not only do we validate our ideas theoretically and with simulation studies, but we also consider application of our proposal to three real datasets used by several authors in the past in connection with mixture models. The results we achieved in each of our experiments with either simulation study or real data application, are quite encouraging. However, the computation can be extremely burdensome in the case of large number of mixture components and in massive data sets. We discuss the role of parallel processing in mitigating the extreme computational burden.","Bounding chains,Dirichlet process,Gibbs sampling,Mixtures,Optimization,Perfect Sampling","BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS,DISTRIBUTIONS,SAMPLERS,CHAINS","Mukhopadhyay, Sabyasachi@Indian Stat Inst, Bayesian & Interdisciplinary Res Unit, Kolkata, India::Bhattacharya, Sourabh@Indian Stat Inst, Bayesian & Interdisciplinary Res Unit, Kolkata, India","Mukhopadhyay, Sabyasachi@Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata@Indian Statistical Institute::Bhattacharya, Sourabh@Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata@Indian Statistical Institute",not exist,"Perfect Posterior Simulation for Mixture and Hidden Markov Models+Berthelsen, K.

Efficient MCMC for Climate Model parameter Estimation: Parallel Adaptive Chains and Early Rejection,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/12-BA724,2012,41,34,"The emergence of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods has opened a way for Bayesian analysis of complex models. Running MCMC samplers typically requires thousands of model evaluations, which can exceed available computer resources when this evaluation is computationally intensive. We will discuss two generally applicable techniques to improve the efficiency of MCMC. First,we consider a parallel version of the adaptive MCMC algorithm of Haario et al. (2001),implementing the idea of inter-chain adaptation introduced by Craiu et al. (2009). Second,we present an early rejection(ER)approach,where model simulation is stopped as soon as one can conclude that the proposed parameter value will be rejected by the MCMC algorithm.

This work is motivated by practical needs in estimating parameters of climate and Earth system models. These computationally intensive models involve non linear expressions of the geophysical and biogeochemical processes of the Earth system. Modeling of these processes,especially those operating in scales smaller than the model grid,involves a number of specified parameters,or`tunables'. MCMC methods are applicable for estimation of these parameters,but they are computationally very demanding. Efficient MCMC variants are thus needed to obtain reliable results in reasonable time.

Computing the Bayes Factor from a Markov Chain Monte CArlo Simulation of the Posterior Distribution,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/12-BA725,2012,26,24,"Determining the marginal likelihood from a simulated posterior distribution is central to Bayesian model selection but is computationally challenging. The often-used harmonic mean approximation (HMA) makes no prior assumptions about the character of the distribution but tends to be inconsistent. The Laplace approximation is stable but makes strong, and often inappropriate, assumptions about the shape of the posterior distribution. Here, I argue that the marginal likelihood can be reliably computed from a posterior sample using Lebesgue integration theory in one of two ways: 1) when the HMA integral exists, compute the measure function numerically and analyze the resulting quadrature to control error; 2) compute the measure function numerically for the marginal likelihood integral itself using a space-partitioning tree, followed by quadrature. The first algorithm automatically eliminates the part of the sample that contributes large truncation error in the HMA. Moreover, it provides a simple graphical test for the existence of the HMA integral. The second algorithm uses the posterior sample to assign probability to a partition of the sample space and performs the marginal likelihood integral directly. It uses the posterior sample to discover and tessellate the subset of the sample space that was explored and uses quantiles to compute a representative field value. When integrating directly, this space may be trimmed to remove regions with low probability density and thereby improve accuracy. This second algorithm is consistent for all proper distributions. Error analysis provides some diagnostics on the numerical condition of the results in both cases.","Bayesian computation,marginal likelihood,algorithm,Bayes factors,model selection","MODEL SELECTION,LIKELIHOOD,INFERENCE","Weinberg, Martin D.@Univ Massachusetts, Dept Astron, Amherst, MA 01003 USA","Weinberg, Martin D.@University of Massachusetts Amherst@University of Massachusetts System","Weinberg, Martin@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2660-2889","BAYESIAN MODEL CHOICE VIA MARKOV-CHAIN MONTE-CARLO METHODS+CARLIN, BP; CHIB, S+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1995::Marginal likelihood from the Metropolis-Hastings output+Chib, S; Jeliazkov, I+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2001::no title+Cormen, T.H.; Stein, C.; Rivest, R.L.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Leiserson, C.E</span>.+Introduction to Algorithms+2001::no title+de Berg, M.; van Kreveld, M.; Overmars, M.H.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Cheong, O</span>.+Computational Geometry: Algorithms and Applications+2008::Computing Bayes factors by combining simulation and asymptotic approximations+DiCiccio, TJ; Kass, RE; Raftery, A; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1997::Incremental topological flipping works for regular triangulations+Edelsbrunner, H; Shah, NR+ALGORITHMICA+MAR 1996::no title+Gelman, A.; Carlin, J.

Spatial Quantile Multiple Regression Using the Asymmetric Laplace Process,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/12-BA708,2012,32,23,"We consider quantile multiple regression through conditional quantile models, i.e. each quantile is modeled separately. We work in the context of spatially referenced data and extend the asymmetric Laplace model for quantile regression to a spatial process, the asymmetric Laplace process (ALP) for quantile regression with spatially dependent errors. By taking advantage of a convenient conditionally Gaussian representation of the asymmetric Laplace distribution, we are able to straightforwardly incorporate spatial dependence in this process. We develop the properties of this process under several specifications, each of which induces different smoothness and covariance behavior at the extreme quantiles.

We demonstrate the advantages that may be gained by incorporating spatial dependence into this conditional quantile model by applying it to a data set of log selling prices of homes in Baton Rouge, LA, given characteristics of each house. We also introduce the asymmetric Laplace predictive process (ALPP) which accommodates large data sets, and apply it to a data set of birth weights given maternal covariates for several thousand births in North Carolina in 2000. By modeling the spatial structure in the data, we are able to show, using a check loss function, improved performance on each of the data sets for each of the quantiles at which the model was fit.","quantile regression,conditional quantiles,spatial statistics,MCMC","COEFFICIENT MODELS,DENSITY REGRESSION,INFERENCE","Lum, Kristian@Unknow::Gelfand, Alan E.@Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC USA","Lum, Kristian@Unknow::Gelfand, Alan E.@Duke University",not exist,"no title+Banerjee, S.; Carlin, B.

Exploiting the connection between copulas and stochastic processes, we provide an alternative definition of MacEachern's dependent Dirichlet processes. Based on this definition, we provide sufficient conditions for the full weak support of different versions of the process. In particular, we show that under mild conditions on the copula functions, the version where only the support points or the weights are dependent on predictors have full weak support. In addition, we also characterize the Hellinger and Kullback-Leibler support of mixtures induced by the different versions of the dependent Dirichlet process.

Mixture Modeling for Marked Poisson Processes,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/12-BA711,2012,49,19,"We propose a general inference framework for marked Poisson processes observed over time or space. Our modeling approach exploits the connection of nonhomogeneous Poisson process intensity with a density function. Nonparametric Dirichlet process mixtures for this density, combined with nonparametric or semiparametric modeling for the mark distribution, yield flexible prior models for the marked Poisson process. In particular, we focus on fully nonparametric model formulations that build the mark density and intensity function from a joint nonparametric mixture, and provide guidelines for straightforward application of these techniques. A key feature of such models is that they can yield flexible inference about the conditional distribution for multivariate marks without requiring specification of a complicated dependence scheme. We address issues relating to choice of the Dirichlet process mixture kernels, and develop methods for prior specification and posterior simulation for full inference about functionals of the marked Poisson process. Moreover, we discuss a method for model checking that can be used to assess and compare goodness of fit of different model specifications under the proposed framework. The methodology is illustrated with simulated and real data sets.","Bayesian nonparametrics,Beta mixtures,Dirichlet process,Marked point process,Multivariate normal mixtures,Non-homogeneous Poisson process,Nonparametric regression","GAUSSIAN COX PROCESSES,DIRICHLET PROCESS,POINT-PROCESSES,NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS,DENSITY-ESTIMATION,BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS,REGRESSION,INTENSITY,INFERENCE,FOREST","Taddy, Matthew A.@Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA::Kottas, Athanasios@Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Appl Math & Stat, Baskin Sch Engn, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Taddy, Matthew A.@University of Chicago::Kottas, Athanasios@University of California Santa Cruz@University of California System",not exist,"no title+Andrews, D.

Log-Linear Pool to Combine Prior Distributions: A Suggestion for a Calibration-Based Approach,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/12-BA714,2012,54,8,"An important issue involved in group decision making is the suitable aggregation of experts' beliefs about a parameter of interest. Two widely used combination methods are linear and log-linear pools. Yet, a problem arises when the weights have to be selected. This paper provides a general decision-based procedure to obtain the weights in a log-linear pooled prior distribution. The process is based on Kullback-Leibler divergence, which is used as a calibration tool. No information about the parameter of interest is considered before dealing with the experts' beliefs. Then, a pooled prior distribution is achieved, for which the expected calibration is the best one in the Kullback-Leibler sense. In the absence of other information available to the decision-maker prior to getting experimental data, the methodology generally leads to selection of the most diffuse pooled prior. In most cases, a problem arises from the marginal distribution related to the noninformative prior distribution since it is improper. In these cases, an alternative procedure is proposed. Finally, two applications show how the proposed techniques can be easily applied in practice.","Bayesian analysis,Kullback-Leibler divergence,Pooled distribution","NATURAL EXPONENTIAL-FAMILIES,QUADRATIC VARIANCE FUNCTIONS,MODEL SELECTION,WEIBULL-DISTRIBUTION,BAYESIAN-INFERENCE,PRIOR INFORMATION,OPINION POOLS,PARAMETERS,SCALE","Rufo, M.

"Beta Processes, Stick-Breaking and Power Laws",BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/12-BA715,2012,35,18,"The beta-Bernoulli process provides a Bayesian nonparametric prior for models involving collections of binary-valued features. A draw from the beta process yields an infinite collection of probabilities in the unit interval, and a draw from the Bernoulli process turns these into binary-valued features. Recent work has provided stick-breaking representations for the beta process analogous to the well-known stick-breaking representation for the Dirichlet process. We derive one such stick-breaking representation directly from the characterization of the beta process as a completely random measure. This approach motivates a three-parameter generalization of the beta process, and we study the power laws that can be obtained from this generalized beta process. We present a posterior inference algorithm for the beta-Bernoulli process that exploits the stick-breaking representation, and we present experimental results for a discrete factor-analysis model.","beta process,stick-breaking,power law","DIRICHLET,PRIORS,MODELS","Broderick, Tamara@Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Stat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA::Jordan, Michael I.@Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Stat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA::Pitman, Jim@Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Stat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Broderick, Tamara@University of California System@University of California Berkeley::Jordan, Michael I.@University of California System@University of California Berkeley::Pitman, Jim@University of California System@University of California Berkeley",not exist,"Variational Inference for Dirichlet Process Mixtures+Blei, David M.; Jordan, Michael I.+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2006::A MEASURE OF ASYMPTOTIC EFFICIENCY FOR TESTS OF A HYPOTHESIS BASED ON THE SUM OF OBSERVATIONS+CHERNOFF, H+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1952::no title+Feller, W.+An Introduction to Probability Theory and its Applications+1966::BAYESIAN ANALYSIS OF SOME NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS+FERGUSON, TS+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1973::Closing the gap in the capacity of wireless networks via percolation theory+Franceschetti, Massimo; Dousse, Olivier; Tse, David N.

Regularization in Regression: Comparing Bayesian and Frequentist Methods in a Poorly Informative Situation,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/12-BA716,2012,44,13,"Using a collection of simulated and real benchmarks, we compare Bayesian and frequentist regularization approaches under a low informative constraint when the number of variables is almost equal to the number of observations on simulated and real datasets. This comparison includes new global noninformative approaches for Bayesian variable selection built on Zellner's g-priors that are similar to liang el al. (2008). The interest of those calibration-free proposals is discussed. The numerical experiments we present highlight the appeal of Bayesian regularization methods, when compared with non-Bayesian alternatives. They dominate frequentist methods in the sense that they provide smaller prediction errors while selecting the most relevant variables in a parsimonious way.","Model choice,regularization methods,noninformative priors,Zellner's g-prior,calibration,Lasso,elastic net,Dantzig selector","VARIABLE SELECTION,MULTIPLE-REGRESSION,LINEAR-REGRESSION,MODEL,CRITERION,LASSO,PARADOX,PRIORS","Celeux, Gilles@Univ Paris 11, Project SELECT, INRIA Saclay, Orsay, France::El Anbari, Mohammed@Univ Caddi Ayyad, Marrakech, Morocco::Marin, Jean-Michel@Univ Montpellier 2, Inst Math & Modlisat, Montpellier, France::Robert, Christian P.@Univ Paris 09, CEREMADE, Inst Univ France, F-75775 Paris, France@CREST, Paris, France","Celeux, Gilles@Universite Paris Saclay@Universite Paris Saclay (ComUE)@Inria@Universite Paris Sud - Paris 11::El Anbari, Mohammed@University of Marrakech Cadi Ayyad::Marin, Jean-Michel@Languedoc-Roussillon Universites (ComUE)@Universite de Montpellier::Robert, Christian P.@PSL Research University Paris (ComUE)@Institut Universitaire de France@Universite Paris-Dauphine","Marin, Jean-Michel@C-7658-2016@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7451-9719::Robert, Christian@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6635-3261","A Comment on D.

Simultaneous Linear Quantile Regression: A Semiparametric Bayesian Approach,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/12-BA702,2012,38,13,"We introduce a semi-parametric Bayesian framework for a simultaneous analysis of linear quantile regression models. A simultaneous analysis is essential to attain the true potential of the quantile regression framework, but is computationally challenging due to the associated monotonicity constraint on the quantile curves. For a univariate covariate, we present a simpler equivalent characterization of the monotonicity constraint through an interpolation of two monotone curves. The resulting formulation leads to a tractable likelihood function and is embedded within a Bayesian framework where the two monotone curves are modeled via logistic transformations of a smooth Gaussian process. A multivariate extension is suggested by combining the full support univariate model with a linear projection of the predictors. The resulting single-index model remains easy to fit and provides substantial and measurable improvement over the first order linear heteroscedastic model. Two illustrative applications of the proposed method are provided.","Bayesian Inference,Bayesian Nonparametric Models,Gaussian Processes,Joint Quantile Model,Linear Quantile Regression,Monotone Curves","LOGISTIC-GAUSSIAN PROCESS,DENSITY-ESTIMATION,NORMAL MIXTURES,PROCESS PRIORS,INFERENCE,CURVES","Tokdar, Surya T.@Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA::Kadane, Joseph B.@Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Stat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA","Tokdar, Surya T.@Duke University::Kadane, Joseph B.@Carnegie Mellon University",not exist,"The Effects of Demographics and Maternal Behavior on the Distribution of Birth Outcomes+Abrevaya, J.+Empirical Economics+2001::Stationary process approximation for the analysis of large spatial datasets+Banerjee, Sudipto; Gelfand, Alan E.; Finley, Andrew O.; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2008::Bayesian density regression+Dunson, David B.; Pillai, Natesh; Park, Ju-Hyun+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2007::Approximate Bayesian inference for quantiles+Dunson, DB; Taylor, JA+JOURNAL OF NONPARAMETRIC STATISTICS+APR-MAY 2005::The increasing intensity of the strongest tropical cyclones+Elsner, James B.; Kossin, James P.; Jagger, Thomas H.+NATURE+SEP 4 2008::Bayesian semiparametric regression for median residual life+Gelfand, AE; Kottas, A+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+DEC 2003::Smoothly mixing regressions+Geweke, John; Keane, Michael+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+MAY 2007::Order-based dependent Dirichlet processes+Griffin, JE; Steel, MFJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2006::REGRESSION RANK SCORES AND REGRESSION QUANTILES+GUTENBRUNNER, C; JURECKOVA, J+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+MAR 1992::Tests of linear hypotheses based on regression rank scores+Gutenbrunner, CJ; Jureckova, J; Koenker, R<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Portnoy, S</span>.+J Non Parametr Stat+1993::Quantile curves without crossing+He, XM+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1997::QUANTILE PYRAMIDS FOR BAYESIAN NONPARAMETRICS+Hjort, Nils Lid; Walker, Stephen G.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 2009::Inference on the quantile regression process+Koenker, R; Xiao, ZJ+ECONOMETRICA+JUL 2002::REGRESSION QUANTILES+KOENKER, R; BASSETT, G+ECONOMETRICA+1978::Quantile regression+Koenker, R; Hallock, KF+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES+FAL 2001::Goodness of fit and related inference processes for quantile regression+Koenker, R; Machado, JAF+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1999::no title+Koenker, R.+Quantile regression+2005::Bayesian semiparametric median regression modeling+Kottas, A; Gelfand, AE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2001::Bayesian Semiparametric Modelling in Quantile Regression+Kottas, Athanasios; Krnjajic, Milovan+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+JUN 2009::BAYESIAN QUANTILE REGRESSION METHODS+Lancaster, Tony; Jun, Sung Jae+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+MAR 2010::TOWARDS A PRACTICABLE BAYESIAN NONPARAMETRIC DENSITY ESTIMATOR+LENK, PJ+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1991::Bayesian semiparametric density estimation and model verification using a logistic-Gaussian process+Lenk, PJ+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+SEP 2003::THE LOGISTIC NORMAL-DISTRIBUTION FOR BAYESIAN, NONPARAMETRIC, PREDICTIVE DENSITIES+LENK, PJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1988::no title+MacEachern, S.+Dependent Dirichlet processes Technical report+2000::no title+MACEACHERN SN+P SECT BAYES STAT SC+1999::Bayesian curve fitting using multivariate normal mixtures+Muller, P; Erkanli, A; West, M+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1996::Flexible Bayesian quantile regression for independent and clustered data+Reich, Brian J.; Bondell, Howard D.; Wang, Huixia J.+BIOSTATISTICS+APR 2010::Bayesian Spatial Quantile Regression+Reich, Brian J.; Fuentes, Montserrat; Dunson, David B.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2011::Bayesian growth curves using normal mixtures with nonparametric weights+Scaccia, L; Green, PJ+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+JUN 2003::A Bayesian Nonparametric Approach to Inference for Quantile Regression+Taddy, Matthew A.; Kottas, Athanasios+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JUL 2010::Bayesian nonparametric quantile regression using splines+Thompson, Paul; Cai, Yuzhi; Moyeed, Rana; et al.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+APR 1 2010::Density regression with logistic Gaussian process priors and subspace projection+Tokdar, S.

"Scalable Variational Inference for Bayesian Variable Selection in Regression, and Its Accuracy in Genetic Association Studies",BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/12-BA703,2012,52,38,"The Bayesian approach to variable selection in regression is a powerful tool for tackling many scientific problems. Inference for variable selection models is usually implemented using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Because MCMC can impose a high computational cost in studies with a large number of variables, we assess an alternative to MCMC based on a simple variational approximation. Our aim is to retain useful features of Bayesian variable selection at a reduced cost. Using simulations designed to mimic genetic association studies, we show that this simple variational approximation yields posterior inferences in some settings that closely match exact values. In less restrictive (and more realistic) conditions, we show that posterior probabilities of inclusion for individual variables are often incorrect, but variational estimates of other useful quantities including posterior distributions of the hyperparameters are remarkably accurate. We illustrate how these results guide the use of variational inference for a genome-wide association study with thousands of samples and hundreds of thousands of variables.","variable selection,variational inference,genetic association studies,Monte Carlo","GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION,SUSCEPTIBILITY LOCI,LINEAR-REGRESSION,CROHNS-DISEASE,MODEL,LASSO,APPROXIMATIONS,SHRINKAGE,ALGORITHM","Carbonetto, Peter@Univ Chicago, Dept Human Genet, Chicago, IL 60637 USA::Stephens, Matthew@Univ Chicago, Dept Human Genet, Chicago, IL 60637 USA@Univ Chicago, Dept Stat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Carbonetto, Peter@University of Chicago::Stephens, Matthew@University of Chicago",not exist,"BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS OF BINARY AND POLYCHOTOMOUS RESPONSE DATA+ALBERT, JH; CHIB, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1993::An introduction to MCMC for machine learning+Andrieu, C; de Freitas, N; Doucet, A; et al.+MACHINE LEARNING+JAN-FEB 2003::Independent factor analysis+Attias, H+NEURAL COMPUTATION+MAY 15 1999::Genome-wide association defines more than 30 distinct susceptibility loci for Crohn's disease+Barrett, Jeffrey C.; Hansoul, Sarah; Nicolae, Dan L.; et al.+NATURE GENETICS+AUG 2008::no title+Berger,, J.+Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis+1985::no title+Bishop, C.

Two-pronged Strategy for Using DIC to Compare Selection Models with Non-Ignorable Missing Responses,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/12-BA704,2012,21,9,"Data with missing responses generated by a non-ignorable missingness mechanism can be analysed by jointly modelling the response and a binary variable indicating whether the response is observed or missing. Using a selection model factorisation, the resulting joint model consists of a model of interest and a model of missingness. In the case of non-ignorable missingness, model choice is difficult because the assumptions about the missingness model are never verifiable from the data at hand. For complete data, the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) is routinely used for Bayesian model comparison. However, when an analysis includes missing data, DIC can be constructed in different ways and its use and interpretation are not straightforward. In this paper, we present a strategy for comparing selection models by combining information from two measures taken from different constructions of the DIC. A DIC based on the observed data likelihood is used to compare joint models with different models of interest but the same model of missingness, and a comparison of models with the same model of interest but different models of missingness is carried out using the model of missingness part of a conditional DIC. This strategy is intended for use within a sensitivity analysis that explores the impact of different assumptions about the two parts of the model, and is illustrated by examples with simulated missingness and an application which compares three treatments for depression using data from a clinical trial. We also examine issues relating to the calculation of the DIC based on the observed data likelihood.","Bayesian model comparison,deviance,DIC,missing response,non-ignorable missingness,observed data likelihood,selection models,sensitivity anlalysis","ECOLOGICAL INFERENCE,LONGITUDINAL DATA,DROP-OUT,INFORMATION,LIKELIHOOD","Mason, Alexina@Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Sch Publ Hlth, London, England::Richardson, Sylvia@Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Sch Publ Hlth, London, England::Best, Nicky@Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Sch Publ Hlth, London, England","Mason, Alexina@Imperial College London::Richardson, Sylvia@Imperial College London::Best, Nicky@Imperial College London","Richardson, Sylvia@G-4691-2015","General methods for monitoring convergence of iterative simulations+Brooks, SP; Gelman, A+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+DEC 1998::Deviance Information Criteria for Missing Data Models+Celeux, G.; Forbes, F.; Robert, C.

A Bayesian Semiparametric Temporally-Stratified Proportional Hazards Model with Spatial Frailties,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/12-BA705,2012,60,7,"Incorporating temporal and spatial variation could potentially enhance information gathered from survival data. This paper proposes a Bayesian semiparametric model for capturing spatio-temporal heterogeneity within the proportional hazards framework. The spatial correlation is introduced in the form of county level frailties. The temporal effect is introduced by considering the stratification of the proportional hazards model, where the time dependent hazards are indirectly modeled using a probability model for related probability distributions. With this aim, an autoregressive dependent tailfree process is introduced. The full Kullback-Leibler support of the proposed process is provided. The approach is illustrated using simulated data and data from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database of the National Cancer Institute on patients in Iowa diagnosed with breast cancer.","Spatio-temporal modeling,Dependent processes,Tailfree processes,Breast cancer","INDEPENDENT METROPOLIS-HASTINGS,CORRELATED SURVIVAL-DATA,ASYMPTOTIC-BEHAVIOR,CENSORED-DATA,POLYA TREES,INFERENCE,MIXTURES,DISTRIBUTIONS,REGRESSION,ALGORITHMS","Hanson, Timothy E.@Univ S Carolina, Dept Stat, Columbia, SC 29208 USA::Jara, Alejandro@Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Stat, Santiago, Chile::Zhao, Luping@Eli Lilly & Co, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA","Hanson, Timothy E.@University of South Carolina Columbia@University of South Carolina@University of South Carolina System::Jara, Alejandro@Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile::Zhao, Luping@Eli Lilly","Hanson, Timothy@A-9127-2016","On adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms+Atchade, YF; Rosenthal, JS+BERNOULLI+OCT 2005::Frailty modeling for spatially correlated survival data, with application to infant mortality in Minnesota+Banerjee, S; Wall, MM; Carlin, BP+BIOSTATISTICS+JAN 2003::Semiparametric spatio-temporal frailty modeling+Banerjee, S; Carlin, BP+ENVIRONMETRICS+AUG 2003::THE STRONG ERGODIC THEOREM FOR DENSITIES - GENERALIZED SHANNON-MCMILLAN-BREIMAN THEOREM+BARRON, AR+ANNALS OF PROBABILITY+1985::BAYESIAN IMAGE-RESTORATION, WITH 2 APPLICATIONS IN SPATIAL STATISTICS+BESAG, J; YORK, J; MOLLIE, A+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+MAR 1991::Metropolis-Hastings algorithms with adaptive proposals+Cai, Bo; Meyer, Renate; Perron, Francois+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+DEC 2008::Partially linear hazard regression for multivariate survival data+Cai, Jianwen; Fan, Jianqing; Jiang, Jiancheng; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2007::Nonparametric Bayes Conditional Distribution Modeling With Variable Selection+Chung, Yeonseung; Dunson, David B.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2009::REGRESSION MODELS AND LIFE-TABLES+COX, DR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1972::An ANOVA model for dependent random measures+De Iorio, M; Muller, P; Rosner, GL; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2004::Bayesian Nonparametric Nonproportional Hazards Survival Modeling+De Iorio, Maria; Johnson, Wesley O.; Mueller, Peter; et al.+BIOMETRICS+SEP 2009::Generalized spatial dirichlet process models+Duan, Jason A.; Guindani, Michele; Gelfand, Alan E.+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 2007::Random distribution functions+Dubins, L.; Freedman, D.+Contributions to Probability Theory, Part 1+1967::Kernelstick-breaking processes+Dunson, D.

Simultaneous Bayesian Inference for Skew-Normal Semiparametric Nonlinear Mixed-Effects Models with Covariate Measurement Errors,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/12-BA706,2012,23,2,"Longitudinal data arise frequently in medical studies and it is a common practice to analyze such complex data with nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) models which enable us to account for between-subject and within-subject variations. To partially explain the variations, covariates are usually introduced to these models. Some covariates, however, may be often measured with substantial errors. It is often the case that model random error is assumed to be distributed normally, but the normality assumption may not always give robust and reliable results, particularly if the data exhibit skewness. Although there has been considerable interest in accommodating either skewness or covariate measurement error in the literature, there is relatively little work that considers both features simultaneously. In this article, our objectives are to address simultaneous impact of skewness and covariate measurement error by jointly modeling the response and covariate processes under a general framework of Bayesian semiparametric nonlinear mixed-effects models. The method is illustrated in an AIDS data example to compare potential models which have different distributional specifications. The findings from this study suggest that the models with a skew-normal distribution may provide more reasonable results if the data exhibit skewness and/or have measurement errors in covariates.","Bayesian approach,Covariate measurement errors,HIV/AIDS,Joint models,Longitudinal data,Semiparametric nonlinear mixed-effects models,Skew-normal distribution","POPULATION,AIDS,DISTRIBUTIONS,PARAMETERS","Huang, Yangxin@Univ S Florida, Coll Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Tampa, FL 33620 USA::Dagne, Getachew A.@Univ S Florida, Coll Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Tampa, FL 33620 USA","Huang, Yangxin@University of South Florida@State University System of Florida::Dagne, Getachew A.@University of South Florida@State University System of Florida",not exist,"Comparison of two indinavir/ritonavir regimens in the treatment of HIV-infected individuals+Acosta, EP; Wu, HL; Hammer, SM; et al.+JAIDS-JOURNAL OF ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROMES+NOV 1 2004::Bayesian inference for skew-normal linear mixed models+Arellano-Valle, R.

Bayesian Strategies to Assess Uncertainty in Velocity Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/12-BA707,2012,14,2,"Quantifying uncertainty in models derived from observed seismic data is a major issue. In this research we examine the geological structure of the subsurface using controlled source seismology which gives the data in time and the distance between the acoustic source and the receiver. Inversion tools exist to map these data into a depth model, but a full exploration of the uncertainty of the model is rarely done because robust strategies do not exist for large non-linear complex systems. There are two principal sources of uncertainty: the first comes from the input data which is noisy and band-limited; the second is from the model parameterisation and forward algorithm which approximate the physics to make the problem tractable. To address these issues we propose a Bayesian approach using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.","Gaussian Processes,Metropolis-Hastings algorithm,Seismology,Velocity Modelling",,"Caiado, Camila C.

Hierarchical Bayesian nonparametric mixture models for clustering with variable relevance determination,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/11-BA612,2011,37,11,We propose a hierarchical Bayesian nonparametric mixture model for clustering when some of the covariates are assumed to be of varying relevance to the clustering problem. This can be thought of as an issue in variable selection for unsupervised learning. We demonstrate that by defining a hierarchical population based nonparametric prior on the cluster locations scaled by the inverse covariance matrices of the likelihood we arrive at a 'sparsity prior' representation which admits a conditionally conjugate prior. This allows us to perform full Gibbs sampling to obtain posterior distributions over parameters of interest including an explicit measure of each covariate's relevance and a distribution over the number of potential clusters present in the data. This also allows for individual cluster specific variable selection. We demonstrate improved inference on a number of canonical problems.,"Bayesian mixture models,Bayesian nonparametric priors,variable selection,unsupervised learning","DIRICHLET PROCESS MIXTURE,MONTE-CARLO METHODS,DENSITY-ESTIMATION,FEATURE-SELECTION,SAMPLING METHODS,UNKNOWN NUMBER,COMPONENTS,PRIORS","Yau, Christopher@Univ Oxford, Dept Stat, Oxford OX1 3TG, England::Holmes, Chris@Univ Oxford, Dept Stat, Oxford OX1 3TG, England@Univ Oxford, Oxford Man Inst, Oxford, England","Yau, Christopher@University of Oxford::Holmes, Chris@University of Oxford","Yau, Christopher@G-2896-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7615-8523","SCALE MIXTURES OF NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS+ANDREWS, DF; MALLOWS, CL+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1974::MIXTURES OF DIRICHLET PROCESSES WITH APPLICATIONS TO BAYESIAN NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS+ANTONIAK, CE+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1974::no title+Claeskens, G; Hjort, NL.+Model Selection and Model Averaging+2008::Genomic aberrations and survival in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.+Dohner, H; Stilgenbauer, S; Benner, A; et al.+NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE+DEC 28 2000::Feature selection for unsupervised learning+Dy, JG; Brodley, CE+JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH+AUG 2004::BAYESIAN DENSITY-ESTIMATION AND INFERENCE USING MIXTURES+ESCOBAR, MD; WEST, M+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1995::ESTIMATING NORMAL MEANS WITH A DIRICHLET PROCESS PRIOR+ESCOBAR, MD+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1994::BAYESIAN ANALYSIS OF SOME NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS+FERGUSON, TS+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1973::The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems+Fisher, RA+ANNALS OF EUGENICS+SEP 1936::Model-based clustering, discriminant analysis, and density estimation+Fraley, C; Raftery, AE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2002::Clustering objects on subsets of attributes+Friedman, JH; Meulman, JJ+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2004::no title+Fruhwirth-Schnatter, S.+Springer Series in Statistics: Finite Mixture and Markov Switching Models+2006::Modelling heterogeneity with and without the Dirichlet process+Green, PJ; Richardson, S+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+JUN 2001::no title+Hastie, T; Tibshirani, R; Friedman, J.+The Elements of Statistical Learning+2009::Model-based subspace clustering+Hoff, Peter D.+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2006::Gibbs sampling methods for stick-breaking priors+Ishwaran, H; James, LF+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2001::A split-merge Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure for the dirichlet process mixture model+Jain, S; Neal, RM+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+MAR 2004::Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and the label switching problem in Bayesian mixture modeling+Jasra, A; Holmes, CC; Stephens, DA+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+FEB 2005::Slice Sampling Mixture Models+Kalli, M.; Griffin, J.; Walker, S.+Statistics and Computing+2011::Variable selection in clustering via Dirichlet process mixture models+Kim, Sinae; Tadesse, Mahlet G.; Vannucci, Marina+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 2006::no title+KNIGHT SJL+LEUKEMIA UNPUB+2011::Simultaneous feature selection and clustering using mixture models+Law, MHC; Figueiredo, MAT; Jain, AK+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE+SEP 2004::Estimating mixture of Dirichlet process models+MacEachern, SN; Muller, P+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+JUN 1998::PROBABLE NETWORKS AND PLAUSIBLE PREDICTIONS - A REVIEW OF PRACTICAL BAYESIAN METHODS FOR SUPERVISED NEURAL NETWORKS+MACKAY, DJC+NETWORK-COMPUTATION IN NEURAL SYSTEMS+AUG 1995::Variable Selection for Clustering with Gaussian Mixture Models+Maugis, Cathy; Celeux, Gilles; Martin-Magniette, Marie-Laure+BIOMETRICS+SEP 2009::no title+Neal, R.

Bayesian Variable Selection for Probit Mixed Models Applied to Gene Selection,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/11-BA607,2011,38,10,"In computational biology, gene expression datasets are characterized by very few individual samples compared to a large number of measurements per sample. Thus, it is appealing to merge these datasets in order to increase the number of observations and diversify the data, allowing a more reliable selection of genes relevant to the biological problem. Besides, the increased size of a merged dataset facilitates its re-splitting into training and validation sets. This necessitates the introduction of the dataset as a random effect. In this context, extending a work of Lee et al. (2003), a method is proposed to select relevant variables among tens of thousands in a probit mixed regression model, considered as part of a larger hierarchical Bayesian model. Latent variables are used to identify subsets of selected variables and the grouping (or blocking) technique of Liu (1994) is combined with a Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm (Robert and Casella 2004). The method is applied to a merged dataset made of three individual gene expression datasets, in which tens of thousands of measurements are available for each of several hundred human breast cancer samples. Even for this large dataset comprised of around 20000 predictors, the method is shown to be efficient and feasible. As an illustration, it is used to select the most important genes that characterize the estrogen receptor status of patients with breast cancer.","Bayesian variable selection,random effects,probit mixed regression model,grouping technique (or blocking technique),Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm","CANCER CLASSIFICATION,LOGISTIC-REGRESSION,EXPRESSION,GIBBS,IDENTIFICATION,EXPLORATION,SIGNATURES","Baragatti, Meli@CNRS, IML, Marseille, France@Ipsogen SA Luminy Biotech Enterprises, Marseille, France","Baragatti, Meli@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)","Baragatti, Meili@A-4221-2017","BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS OF BINARY AND POLYCHOTOMOUS RESPONSE DATA+ALBERT, JH; CHIB, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1993::no title+BARAGATTI M+ARXIV11020470+2011::Evolutionary Stochastic Search for Bayesian Model Exploration+Bottolo, Leonard; Richardson, Sylvia+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2010::Variable selection for multivariate logistic regression models+Chen, MH; Dey, DK+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+FEB 1 2003::Effect of Nitrogen Fertilizer and Molybdenum on Nitrate Accumulation on Rape and Chingensai+Chen, Wei-Ling; Zhou, Shu-Wei; Li, Ping-Ying; et al.+Bulletin of Taichung District Agricultural Improvement Station+MAR 2010::The practical implementation of Bayesian Model Selection+Chipman, H.; George, E.; McCulloch, R.+Model Selection+2001::Identification of new genes associated with breast cancer progression by gene expression analysis of predefined sets of neoplastic tissues+Cimino, Daniela; Fuso, Luca; Sfiligoi, Christian; et al.+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER+SEP 15 2008::Flexible empirical Bayes estimation for wavelets+Clyde, M; George, EI+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2000::Gene Expression Omnibus: NCBI gene expression and hybridization array data repository+Edgar, R; Domrachev, M; Lash, AE+NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH+JAN 1 2002::Bayesian variable selection for random intercept modelling of Gaussian and non-Gaussian data+Fruhwirth-Schnatter,, S.; Wagner,, H.+Bayesian Statistics 9+2010::Prior distributions for variance parameters in hierarchical models(Comment on an Article by Browne and Draper)+Gelman, Andrew+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2006::Calibration and empirical Bayes variable selection+George, EI; Foster, DP+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 2000::VARIABLE SELECTION VIA GIBBS SAMPLING+GEORGE, EI; MCCULLOCH, RE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1993::Approaches for Bayesian variable selection+George, EI; McCulloch, RE+STATISTICA SINICA+APR 1997::Gene selection for cancer classification using support vector machines+Guyon, I; Weston, J; Barnhill, S; et al.+MACHINE LEARNING+2002::Exploration, normalization, and summaries of high density oligonucleotide array probe level data+Irizarry, RA; Hobbs, B; Collin, F; et al.+BIOSTATISTICS+APR 2003::Gene selection: a Bayesian variable selection approach+Lee, KE; Sha, NJ; Dougherty, ER; et al.+BIOINFORMATICS+JAN 2003::THE COLLAPSED GIBBS SAMPLER IN BAYESIAN COMPUTATIONS WITH APPLICATIONS TO A GENE-REGULATION PROBLEM+LIU, JS+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1994::Gene expression signatures and biomarkers of noninvasive and invasive breast cancer cells: comprehensive profiles by representational difference analysis, microarrays and proteomics+Nagaraja, GM; Othman, M; Fox, BP; et al.+ONCOGENE+APR 13 2006::A Review of Bayesian Variable Selection Methods: What, How and Which+O'Hara, R.

Bayesian Inference for Irreducible Diffusion Processes Using the Pseudo-Marginal Approach,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/11-BA608,2011,34,10,"In this article we examine two relatively new MCMC methods which allow for Bayesian inference in diffusion models. First, the Monte Carlo within Metropolis (MCWM) algorithm (O'Neil et al. 2000) uses an importance sampling approximation for the likelihood and yields a Markov chain. Our simulation study shows that there exists a limiting stationary distribution that can be made arbitrarily ""close"" to the posterior distribution (MCWM is not a standard Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, however). The second method, described in Beaumont (2003) and generalized in Andrieu and Roberts (2009), introduces auxiliary variables and utilizes a standard Metropolis-Hastings algorithm on the enlarged space; this method preserves the original posterior distribution. When applied to diffusion models, this pseudo-marginal (PM) approach can be viewed as a generalization of the popular data augmentation schemes that sample jointly from the missing paths and the parameters of the diffusion volatility. The efficacy of the PM approach is demonstrated in a simulation study of the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) and Heston models, and is applied to two well known datasets. Comparisons are made with the MCWM algorithm and the Golightly and Wilkinson (2008) approach.","Diffusion process,Euler discretization,Markov chain Monte Caro (MCMC),Pseudo-Marginal (PM) Algorithm,Grouped Independence Metropolis-Hastings (GIMH),Monte Carlo within Metropolis (MCWM)","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,STOCHASTIC VOLATILITY MODELS,MULTIVARIATE DIFFUSIONS,NONLINEAR DIFFUSIONS,TRANSITION DENSITY,TIME,EXPANSIONS,ALGORITHM,DYNAMICS,OPTIONS","Stramer, Osnat@Univ Iowa, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA::Bognar, Matthew@Univ Iowa, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA","Stramer, Osnat@University of Iowa::Bognar, Matthew@University of Iowa",not exist,"Maximum likelihood estimation of discretely sampled diffusions: A closed-form approximation approach+Ait-Sahalia, Y+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 2002::Transition densities for interest rate and other nonlinear diffusions+Ait-Sahalia, Y+JOURNAL OF FINANCE+AUG 1999::Closed-form likelihood expansions for multivariate diffusions+Ait-Sahalia, Yacine+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2008::Maximum likelihood estimation of stochastic volatility models+Ait-Sahalia, Yacine; Kimmel, Robert+JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS+FEB 2007::no title+ANDRIEU C+POSTERIOR SAMPLING P+2010::THE PSEUDO-MARGINAL APPROACH FOR EFFICIENT MONTE CARLO COMPUTATIONS+Andrieu, Christophe; Roberts, Gareth O.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2009::The law of the Euler scheme for stochastic differential equations: II.

We define and implement a one-step-ahead prediction algorithm with the model using multi-process modelling and the power steady model that is robust to short-term variations in the data yet sensitive to underlying system changes. We demonstrate that the whole analysis can be performed in a conjugate way so that the potentially vast model space can be traversed quickly and then results communicated transparently. We also demonstrate how to analyse a general set of causal hypotheses on this model class.

Bayesian Estimation of Intensity Surfaces on the Sphere via Needlet Shrinkage and Selection,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/11-BA611,2011,29,8,"This paper describes an approach for Bayesian modeling in spherical datasets. Our method is based upon a recent construction called the needlet, which is a particular form of spherical wavelet with many favorable statistical and computational properties. We perform shrinkage and selection of needlet coefficients, focusing on two main alternatives: empirical-Bayes thresholding, and Bayesian local shrinkage rules. We study the performance of the proposed methodology both on simulated data and on two real data sets: one involving the cosmic microwave background radiation, and one involving the reconstruction of a global news intensity surface inferred from published Reuters articles in August, 1996. The fully Bayesian approach based on robust, sparse shrinkage priors seems to outperform other alternatives.","needlets,shrinkage estimate,spherical wavelets","DISTRIBUTIONS,MODEL","Scott, James G.@Univ Texas Austin, McCombs Sch Business, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Scott, James G.@University of Texas System@University of Texas Austin",not exist,"Gene selection using a two-level hierarchical Bayesian model+Bae, K; Mallick, BK+BIOINFORMATICS+DEC 12 2004::ADAPTIVE DENSITY ESTIMATION FOR DIRECTIONAL DATA USING NEEDLETS+Baldi, P.; Kerkyacharian, G.; Marinucci, D.; et al.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 2009::ASYMPTOTICS FOR SPHERICAL NEEDLETS+Baldi, P.; Kerkyacharian, G.; Marinucci, D.; et al.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2009::Subsampling needlet coefficients on the sphere+Baldi, P.; Kerkyacharian, G.; Marinucci, D.; et al.+BERNOULLI+MAY 2009::NORMAL VARIANCE MEAN MIXTURES AND Z-DISTRIBUTIONS+BARNDORFFNIELSEN, O; KENT, J; SORENSEN, M+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+1982::Laplace approximations for hypergeometric functions with matrix argument+Butler, RW; Wood, ATA+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+AUG 2002::Handling sparsity via the horseshoe+Carvalho, C.

Likelihood-free estimation of model evidence,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/11-BA602,2011,50,31,"Statistical methods of inference typically require the likelihood function to be computable in a reasonable amount of time. The class of ""likelihood-free"" methods termed Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is able to eliminate this requirement, replacing the evaluation of the likelihood with simulation from it. Likelihood-free methods have gained in efficiency and popularity in the past few years, following their integration with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) in order to better explore the parameter space. They have been applied primarily to estimating the parameters of a given model, but can also be used to compare models.

Here we present novel likelihood-free approaches to model comparison, based upon the independent estimation of the evidence of each model under study. Key advantages of these approaches over previous techniques are that they allow the exploitation of MCMC or SMC algorithms for exploring the parameter space, and that they do not require a sampler able to mix between models. We validate the proposed methods using a simple exponential family problem before providing a realistic problem from human population genetics: the comparison of different demographic models based upon genetic data from the Y chromosome.",,"APPROXIMATE BAYESIAN COMPUTATION,SEQUENTIAL MONTE-CARLO,HUMAN Y-CHROMOSOMES,POPULATION-GENETICS,MARGINAL LIKELIHOOD,DNA-SEQUENCES,INFERENCE,CRITICISM,SELECTION,ALLELES","Didelot, Xavier@Univ Oxford, Dept Stat, Oxford OX1 2JD, England::Everitt, Richard G.@Univ Bristol, Dept Math, Bristol BS8 1TH, Avon, England::Johansen, Adam M.@Univ Warwick, Dept Stat, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England::Lawson, Daniel J.@Univ Bristol, Dept Math, Bristol BS8 1TH, Avon, England","Didelot, Xavier@University of Oxford::Everitt, Richard G.@University of Bristol::Johansen, Adam M.@University of Warwick::Lawson, Daniel J.@University of Bristol","Didelot, Xavier@H-1608-2013::Johansen, Adam@D-8588-2011@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3531-7628::Everitt, Richard@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0822-5648::Lawson, Daniel@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5311-6213","Approximate Bayesian computation in population genetics+Beaumont, MA; Zhang, WY; Balding, DJ+GENETICS+DEC 2002::Marginal likelihood from the Gibbs output+Chib, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1995::Sequential Monte Carlo samplers+Del Moral, P; Doucet, A; Jasra, A+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2006::Feynman-Kac formulae+Del Moral, P.+Probability and its applications+2004::On Bayesian model and variable selection using MCMC+Dellaportas, P; Forster, JJ; Ntzoufras, I+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+JAN 2002::no title+DELMORAL P+ADAPTIVE SEQUENTIAL+2008::no title+Fearnhead, P.; Prangle, D.+ArXiv e-prints [arXiv:1004.1112]+2010::Marginal likelihood estimation via power posteriors+Friel, N.; Pettitt, A.

Reduced rank regression models with latent variables in Bayesian functional data analysis,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/11-BA603,2011,58,2,In functional data analysis (FDA) it is of interest to generalize techniques of multivariate analysis like canonical correlation analysis or regression to functions which are often observed with noise. In the proposed Bayesian approach to FDA two tools are combined: (i) a special Demmler-Reinsch like basis of interpolation splines to represent functions parsimoniously and flexibly; (ii) latent variable models initially introduced for probabilistic principal components analysis or canonical correlation analysis of the corresponding coefficients. In this way partial curves and non-Gaussian measurement error schemes can be handled. Bayesian inference is based on a variational algorithm such that computations are straight forward and fast corresponding to an idea of FDA as a tool box for explorative data analysis.

Bayesian nonparametric model for clustering individual co-exposure to pesticides found in the French diet,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/11-BA604,2011,18,13,"This work introduces a specific application of Bayesian nonparametric statistics to the food risk analysis framework. The goal was to determine the cocktails of pesticide residues to which the French population is simultaneously exposed through its current diet in order to study their possible combined effects on health through toxicological experiments. To do this, the joint distribution of exposures to a large number of pesticides, which we called the co-exposure distribution, was assessed from the available consumption data and food contamination analyses. We propose modelling the co-exposure using a Dirichlet process mixture based on a multivariate Gaussian kernel so as to determine groups of individuals with similar co-exposure patterns. Posterior distributions and optimal partition were computed through a Gibbs sampler based on stick-breaking priors. The study of the correlation matrix of the sub-population co-exposures will be used to define the cocktails of pesticides to which they are jointly exposed at high doses. To reduce the computational burden due to the high data dimensionality, a random block sampling approach was used. In addition, we propose to account for the uncertainty of food contamination through the introduction of an additional level of hierarchy in the model. The results of both specifications are described and compared.","Dirichlet process,Bayesian nonparametric modeling,multivariate Normal mixtures,clustering,multivariate exposure,food risk analysis","DIRICHLET PROCESSES,DENSITY-ESTIMATION,DISTRIBUTIONS,INFERENCE,MIXTURES,PRIORS","Crepet, Amelie@ANSES, French Agcy Food Environm & Occupat Hlth Safety, Maisons Alfort, France::Tressou, Jessica@Natl Inst Agron Res, INRA Met Risk, Paris, France","Crepet, Amelie@Agence Nationale de Securite Sanitaire de lAlimentation, de lEnvironnement du Travail (ANSES)::Tressou, Jessica@Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA)",not exist,"no title+*AFSSA FRENCH FOOD+INCA 2 2006 2007 ET+2009::MIXTURES OF DIRICHLET PROCESSES WITH APPLICATIONS TO BAYESIAN NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS+ANTONIAK, CE+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1974::FERGUSON DISTRIBUTIONS VIA POLYA URN SCHEMES+BLACKWELL, D; MACQUEEN, JB+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1973::no title+CABRERA J+RANDOM BLOCK SAMPLIN+2009::Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance flurochloridone (notified active substance)+no author+EFSA J+2010::BAYESIAN DENSITY-ESTIMATION AND INFERENCE USING MIXTURES+ESCOBAR, MD; WEST, M+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1995::BAYESIAN ANALYSIS OF SOME NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS+FERGUSON, TS+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1973::Gibbs sampling methods for stick-breaking priors+Ishwaran, H; James, LF+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2001::no title+LAU JW+MODEL BASED CLUSTERI+2007::ON A CLASS OF BAYESIAN NONPARAMETRIC ESTIMATES .1.

We verify our representation by demonstrating that minimizing the SVM optimality criterion together with the parameter regularization penalty is equivalent to finding the mode of a mean-variance mixture of normals pseudo-posterior distribution. The latent variables in the mixture representation lead to EM and ECME point estimates of SVM parameters, as well as MCMC algorithms based on Gibbs sampling that can bring Bayesian tools for Gaussian linear models to bear on SVM's. We show how to implement SVM's with spike-and-slab priors and run them against data from a standard spam filtering data set.","MCMC,Bayesian inference,Regularization,Lasso,L-alpha-norm,EM,MCMC,ECME","BAYESIAN VARIABLE SELECTION,NORMAL-DISTRIBUTIONS,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,SCALE MIXTURES,REGRESSION,ALGORITHM,MODELS,ESTIMATORS,ECM,EM","Polson, Nicholas G.@Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL USA::Scott, Steven L.@Unknow","Polson, Nicholas G.@Unknow::Scott, Steven L.@Unknow",not exist,"SCALE MIXTURES OF NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS+ANDREWS, DF; MALLOWS, CL+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1974::INFERENCE FOR NONCONJUGATE BAYESIAN MODELS USING THE GIBBS SAMPLER+CARLIN, BP; POLSON, NG+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+DEC 1991::Constructing Bayesian formulations of sparse kernel learning methods+Cawley, GC; Talbot, NLC+NEURAL NETWORKS+JUN-JUL 2005::Model uncertainty+Clyde, M; George, EI+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+FEB 2004::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::no title+Devroye, L.+Non-uniform random variate generation+1986::Variable selection via nonconcave penalized likelihood and its oracle properties+Fan, JQ; Li, RZ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2001::VARIABLE SELECTION VIA GIBBS SAMPLING+GEORGE, EI; MCCULLOCH, RE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1993::Approaches for Bayesian variable selection+George, EI; McCulloch, RE+STATISTICA SINICA+APR 1997::Bayesian approach to feature selection and parameter tuning for support vector machine classifiers+Gold, C; Holub, A; Sollich, P+NEURAL NETWORKS+JUN-JUL 2005::RIDGE-TYPE ESTIMATORS FOR REGRESSION-ANALYSIS+GOLDSTEIN, M; SMITH, AFM+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1974::no title+GOLUB GH+MATRIX COMPUTATIONS+2008::Multivariate exponential power distributions as mixtures of normal distributions with bayesian applications+Gomez-Sanchez-Manzano, E.; Gomez-Villegas, M.

"Separable covariance arrays via the Tucker product, with applications to multivariate relational data",BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/11-BA606,2011,20,31,"Modern datasets are often in the form of matrices or arrays, potentially having correlations along each set of data indices. For example, data involving repeated measurements of several variables over time may exhibit temporal correlation as well as correlation among the variables. A possible model for matrix-valued data is the class of matrix normal distributions, which is parametrized by two covariance matrices, one for each index set of the data. In this article we discuss an extension of the matrix normal model to accommodate multidimensional data arrays, or tensors. We show how a particular array-matrix product can be used to generate the class of array normal distributions having separable covariance structure. We derive some properties of these covariance structures and the corresponding array normal distributions, and show how the array-matrix product can be used to define a semi-conjugate prior distribution and calculate the corresponding posterior distribution.

Sensitivity analysis in Bayesian generalized linear mixed models for binary data,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/11-BA609,2011,33,48,"Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) enjoy increasing popularity because of their ability to model correlated observations. Integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLAs) provide a fast implementation of the Bayesian approach to GLMMs. However, sensitivity to prior assumptions on the random effects precision parameters is a potential problem. To quantify the sensitivity to prior assumptions, we develop a general sensitivity measure based on the Hellinger distance to assess sensitivity of the posterior distributions with respect to changes in the prior distributions for the precision parameters. In addition, for model selection we suggest several cross-validatory techniques for Bayesian GLMMs with a dichotomous outcome. Although the proposed methodology holds in greater generality, we make use of the developed methods in the particular context of the well-known salamander mating data.

An enriched conjugate prior for Bayesian nonparametric inference,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/11-BA614,2011,19,11,"The precision parameter alpha plays an important role in the Dirichlet Process. When assigning a Dirichlet Process prior to the set of probability measures on R(k), k > 1, this can be restrictive in the sense that the variability is determined by a single parameter. The aim of this paper is to construct an enrichment of the Dirichlet Process that is more flexible with respect to the precision parameter yet still conjugate, starting from the notion of enriched conjugate priors,which have been proposed to address an analogous lack of flexibility of standard conjugate priors in a parametric setting. The resulting enriched conjugate prior allows more flexibility in modelling uncertainty on the marginal and conditionals. We describe an enriched urn scheme which characterizes this process and show that it can also be obtained from the stick-breaking representation of the marginal and conditionals. For non atomic base measures, this allows global clustering of the marginal variables and local clustering of the conditional variables. Finally, we consider an application to mixture models that allows for uncertainty between homoskedasticity and heteroskedasticity.","Bayesian nonparametric inference,conjugate priors,generalized Dirichlet,Dirichlet process,mixture models,Polya urns,multivariate random distribution functions","DIRICHLET DISTRIBUTION,EXPONENTIAL-FAMILIES,DISTRIBUTIONS,INDEPENDENCE","Wade, Sara@Bocconi Univ, Dept Decis Sci, Milan, Italy::Mongelluzzo, Silvia@Bocconi Univ, Dept Decis Sci, Milan, Italy::Petrone, Sonia@Bocconi Univ, Dept Decis Sci, Milan, Italy","Wade, Sara@Bocconi University::Mongelluzzo, Silvia@Bocconi University::Petrone, Sonia@Bocconi University","Wade, Sara@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6547-5555","FERGUSON DISTRIBUTIONS VIA POLYA URN SCHEMES+BLACKWELL, D; MACQUEEN, JB+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1973::Problemi statistici nonparametrici in condizioni di scambiabilit parziale e impiego di medie associative+Cifarelli, D.; Regazzini, E.+Quad.

Recent advances on Bayesian inference for P(X < Y),BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/11-BA616,2011,45,15,"We address the statistical problem of evaluating R = P(X < Y), where X and Y are two independent random variables. Bayesian parametric inference is based on the marginal posterior density of R and has been widely discussed under various distributional assumptions on X and Y. This classical approach requires both elicitation of a prior on the complete parameter and numerical integration in order to derive the marginal distribution of R. In this paper, we discuss and apply recent advances in Bayesian inference based on higher-order asymptotics and on pseudo-likelihoods, and related matching priors, which allow one to perform accurate inference on the parameter of interest R only, even for small sample sizes. The proposed approach has the advantages of avoiding the elicitation on the nuisance parameters and the computation of multidimensional integrals. From a theoretical point of view, we show that the used prior is a strong matching prior. From an applied point of view, the accuracy of the proposed methodology is illustrated both by numerical studies and by real-life data concerning clinical studies.","Asymptotic expansions,Frequentist coverage probability,Matching prior,Modified likelihood root,Modified profile likelihood,Nuisance parameter,ROC curve,Stochastic precedence,Stress-strength model,Tail area probability","NUISANCE PARAMETERS,PROFILE LIKELIHOODS,PRIOR DISTRIBUTIONS,PSEUDO-LIKELIHOODS,POINT ESTIMATION,FREQUENTIST,ORDER","Ventura, Laura@Univ Padua, Dept Stat, Padua, Italy::Racugno, Walter@Univ Cagliari, Dept Math, Cagliari, Italy","Ventura, Laura@University of Padua::Racugno, Walter@University of Cagliari",not exist,"Assessment of elastase-induced murien abdominal aortic aneurysms: comparison of ultrasound imaging with in situ video microscopy+Azuma, J.; Maegdefessel, L.; Kitagawa, T.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Dalman, R.

Goodness-of-Fit of Conditional Regression Models for Multiple Imputation,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/11-BA617,2011,27,1,"We propose the calibrated posterior predictive p-value (cppp) as an interpretable goodness-of-fit (GOP) measure for regression models in sequential regression multiple imputation (SRMI). The cppp is uniformly distributed under the assumed model, while the posterior predictive p-value (ppp) is not in general and in particular when the percentage of missing data, pm, increases. Uniformity of cppp allows the analyst to evaluate properly the evidence against the assumed model. We show the advantages of cppp over ppp in terms of power in detecting common departures from the assumed model and, more importantly, in terms of robustness with respect to pm. In the imputation phase, which provides a complete database for general statistical analyses, default and improper priors are usually needed, whereas the cppp requires a proper prior on regression parameters. We avoid this problem by introducing the use of a minimum training sample that turns the improper prior into a proper distribution. The dependency on the training sample is naturally accounted for by changing the training sample at each step of the SRMI. Our results come from theoretical considerations together with simulation studies and an application to a real data set of anthropometric measures.","Calibrated posterior predictive p-value,Discrepancy measure,Minimum training sample,Missing at random,Predictive distribution,Sequential regression multiple imputation","PREDICTIVE P-VALUES,COMPOSITE NULL MODELS,HIERARCHICAL-MODELS,CHECKING,INFERENCE","Cabras, Stefano@Univ Cagliari, Dipartimento Matemat & Informat, I-09124 Cagliari, Italy::Eugenia Castellanos, Maria@Unknow::Quiros, Alicia@Unknow","Cabras, Stefano@University of Cagliari::Eugenia Castellanos, Maria@Unknow::Quiros, Alicia@Unknow","Castellanos, Maria Eugenia@E-9851-2016@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7920-2307::Quiros, Alicia@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5259-4793::Cabras, Stefano@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6690-8378","Diagnostics for multivariate imputations+Abayomi, Kobi; Gelman, Andrew; Levy, Marc+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2008::Quantifying surprise in the data and model verification [with discussion]+Bayarri, M.

Flexible Paleoclimate Age-Depth Models Using an Autoregressive Gamma Process,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/11-BA618,2011,43,672,"Radiocarbon dating is routinely used in paleoecology to build chronologies of lake and peat sediments, aiming at inferring a model that would relate the sediment depth with its age. We present a new approach for chronology building (called ""Bacon"") that has received enthusiastic attention by paleoecologists. Our methodology is based on controlling core accumulation rates using a gamma autoregressive semiparametric model with an arbitrary number of subdivisions along the sediment. Using prior knowledge about accumulation rates is crucial and informative priors are routinely used. Since many sediment cores are currently analyzed, using different data sets and prior distributions, a robust (adaptive) MCMC is very useful. We use the t-walk (Christen and Fox, 2010), a self adjusting, robust MCMC sampling algorithm, that works acceptably well in many situations. Outliers are also addressed using a recent approach that considers a Student-t model for radiocarbon data. Two examples are presented here, that of a peat core and a core from a lake, and our results are compared with other approaches.","AR Gamma process,Radiocarbon,Paleoecology,Age-Depth models","ISOTONIC REGRESSION,RADIOCARBON-DATES,CLIMATE CHANGES,PEAT DEPOSITS,PROXY DATA,EVENTS,CALIBRATION,HISTORY,RECORDS,POLLEN","Blaauw, Maarten@Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Geog Archaeol & Palaeoecol, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland::Andres Christen, J.@Ctr Invest Matemat CIMAT, Guanajuato, Mexico","Blaauw, Maarten@Queens University Belfast::Andres Christen, J.@CIMAT - Centro de Investigacion en Matematicas","Blaauw, Maarten@E-4539-2011@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5680-1515::Christen, J Andres@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5795-4345","A NEW ROBUST STATISTICAL MODEL FOR RADIOCARBON DATA+Andres Christen, J.; Perez E, Sergio+RADIOCARBON+2009::A tutorial on adaptive MCMC+Andrieu, Christophe; Thoms, Johannes+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+DEC 2008::Non-Gaussian Ornstein-Uhlenbeck-based models and some of their uses in financial economics+Barndorff-Nielsen, OE; Shephard, N+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2001::Integrated OU processes and non-Gaussian OU-based stochastic volatility models+Barndorff-Nielsen, OE; Shephard, N+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+JUN 2003::Feedback control of the rate of peat formation+Belyea, LR; Clymo, RS+PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES+JUN 22 2001::Radiocarbon peat chronologies and environmental change+Blaauw, M.; Christen, J.

Approximate simulation-free Bayesian inference for multiple changepoint models with dependence within segments,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/11-BA620,2011,17,9,"This paper proposes approaches for the analysis of multiple changepoint models when dependency in the data is modelled through a hierarchical Gaussian Markov random field. Integrated nested Laplace approximations are used to approximate data quantities, and an approximate filtering recursions approach is proposed for savings in compuational cost when detecting changepoints. All of these methods are simulation free. Analysis of real data demonstrates the usefulness of the approach in general. The new models which allow for data dependence are compared with conventional models where data within segments is assumed independent.","Changepoints,Gaussian Markov Random Field,Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA),approximate inference,model selection","HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS,POISSON-PROCESS,CHANGE-POINT","Wyse, Jason@UCL, Dept Stat Sci, London, England::Friel, Nial@Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Math Sci, Dublin 2, Ireland::Rue, Harvard@Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Math Sci, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway","Wyse, Jason@University of London@University College London::Friel, Nial@University College Dublin::Rue, Harvard@Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU)@Norwegian University of Science & Technology","Wyse, Jason@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1391-7371","A Bayesian approach to DNA sequence segmentation+Boys, RJ; Henderson, DA+BIOMETRICS+SEP 2004::no title+CARLIN BP+APPL STAT-J ROY ST C+1992::Estimation and comparison of multiple change-point models+Chib, S+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+OCT 1998::no title+Cox, D.

Impact of Beliefs About Atlantic Tropical Cyclone Detection on Conclusions About Trends in Tropical Cyclone Numbers,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/11-BA621,2011,56,4,"Whether the number of tropical cyclones (TCs) has increased in the last 150 years has become a matter of intense debate. We investigate the effects of beliefs about TC detection capacities in the North Atlantic on trends in TC numbers since the 1870s. While raw data show an increasing trend of TC counts, the capability to detect TCs and to determine intensities and changes in intensity has also increased dramatically over the same period. We present a model of TC activity that allows investigating the relationship between what one believes about the increase in detection and what one believes about TC trends. Previous work has used assumptions on TC tracks, detection capacities or the relationship between TC activity and various climate parameters to provide estimates of year-by-year missed TCs. These estimates and the associated conclusions about trends cover a wide range of possibilities. We build on previous work to investigate the sensitivity of these conclusions to the assumed priors about detection. Our analysis shows that any inference on TC count trends is strongly sensitive to one's specification of prior beliefs about TC detection. Overall, we regard the evidence on the trend in North Atlantic TC numbers to be ambiguous.","Atlantic tropical cyclones,HURDAT,tropical cyclone data,tropical cyclone detection","HURRICANE ACTIVITY,NORTH-ATLANTIC,INTENSITY,VARIABILITY,REANALYSIS,MECHANISM,INCREASE,PROJECT,MODELS","Tokdar, Surya T.@Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC 27710 USA::Grossmann, Iris@Carnegie Mellon Univ, Climate Decis Making Ctr, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA::Kadane, Joseph B.@Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Stat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA::Charest, Anne-Sophie@Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Stat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA::Small, Mitchell J.@Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Engn & Publ Policy, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA","Tokdar, Surya T.@Duke University::Grossmann, Iris@Carnegie Mellon University::Kadane, Joseph B.@Carnegie Mellon University::Charest, Anne-Sophie@Carnegie Mellon University::Small, Mitchell J.@Carnegie Mellon University",not exist,"no title+Allison, P.+Missing data+2001::The effects of marine winds from scatterometer data on weather analysis and forecasting+Atlas, R; Hoffman, RN; Leidner, SM; et al.+BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY+SEP 2001::Comment on ""Is the number of North Atlantic tropical cyclones significantly underestimated prior to the availability of satellite observations?'' by Edmund K.

Model based clustering for three-way data structures,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/11-BA622,2011,32,5,"The technological progress of the last decades has made a huge amount of information available, often expressed in unconventional formats. Among these, three-way data occur in different application domains from the simultaneous observation of various attributes on a set of units in different situations or locations. These include data coming from longitudinal studies of multiple responses, spatio-temporal data or data collecting multivariate repeated measures. In this work we propose model based clustering for the wide class of continuous three-way data by a general mixture model which can be adapted to the different kinds of three-way data. In so doing we also provide a tool for simultaneously performing model estimation and model selection. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated on a simulation study and on real examples.","Mixture models,Birth and death process,Matrix-variate normal distribution,Three-way data","REVERSIBLE JUMP,BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS,UNKNOWN NUMBER,MIXTURE-MODELS,COMPONENTS,ALGORITHM,MATRIX","Viroli, Cinzia@Univ Bologna, Dept Stat, I-40126 Bologna, Italy","Viroli, Cinzia@University of Bologna","Viroli, Cinzia@F-5786-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3278-5266","THE MIXTURE METHOD OF CLUSTERING APPLIED TO 3-WAY DATA+BASFORD, KE; MCLACHLAN, GJ+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+1985::Reversible jump, birth-and-death and more general continuous time Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers+Cappe, O; Robert, CP; Ryden, T+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2003::Bayesian inference for mixtures: the label-switching problem+Celeux, G.+COMPSTAT 98+1998::no title+CHANG WC+APPL STAT-J ROY ST C+1983::A simulation study to compare robust clustering methods based on mixtures+Coretto, Pietro; Hennig, Christian+ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION+SEP 2010::Multivariate mixtures of normals with unknown number of components+Dellaportas, P; Papageorgiou, I+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+MAR 2006::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::The MLE algorithm for the matrix normal distribution+Dutilleul, P+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+1999::Modelling spatially correlated data via mixtures: a Bayesian approach+Fernandez, C; Green, PJ+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2002::no title+FRALEY C+504 U WASH DEP STAT+2006::Model-based clustering, discriminant analysis, and density estimation+Fraley, C; Raftery, AE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2002::Bayesian nonparametric spatial modeling with Dirichlet process mixing+Gelfand, AE; Kottas, A; MacEachern, SN+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2005::Inference from iterative simulation using multiple sequences+Gelman, A; Rubin, DB.+Stat Sci+1992::STOCHASTIC RELAXATION, GIBBS DISTRIBUTIONS, AND THE BAYESIAN RESTORATION OF IMAGES+GEMAN, S; GEMAN, D+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE+1984::Partitions of partitions+Gordon, AD; Vichi, M+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+1998::no title+Gottardo, R; Lo, K; Celeux, G<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Raftery, A.

Neutral-data comparisons for Bayesian testing,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/11-BA623,2011,33,0,"A novel approach to evidence assessment in Bayesian hypothesis testing is proposed, in the form of a ""neutral-data comparison."" The proposed assessment is similar to a Bayes factor, but, rather than comparing posterior to prior odds, it compares the posterior odds of the observed data to that calculated on ""neutral"" data, which arise as part of the elicitation of prior knowledge. The article develops a general theory of neutral-data comparisons, motivated largely by the Jeffreys-Lindley paradox, and develops methodology for specifying and working with neutral data in the context of Gaussian linear-models analysis. The proposed methodology is shown to exhibit exceptionally strong asymptotic-consistency properties in high dimensions, and, in an application example, to accommodate challenging analysis objectives using basic computational algorithms.","Bayesian hypothesis testing,Bayes factors,Bayesian asymptotic-consistency,model choice in high dimensions,analysis of variance","DIMENSIONAL FEATURE SPACE,VARIABLE SELECTION,MODEL SELECTION,LINEAR-MODELS,CONSISTENCY,PRIORS","Spitzner, Dan J.@Univ Virginia, Dept Stat, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA","Spitzner, Dan J.@University of Virginia",not exist,"POSTERIOR BAYES FACTORS+AITKIN, M+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1991::no title+Bellman, R.+Introduction to Matrix Analysis+1960::THE FORMAL DEFINITION OF REFERENCE PRIORS+Berger, James O.; Bernardo, Jose M.; Sun, Dongchu+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2009::Approximations and consistency of Bayes factors as model dimension grows+Berger, JO; Ghosh, JK; Mukhopadhyay, N+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+MAR 1 2003::The intrinsic Bayes factor for model selection and prediction+Berger, JO; Pericchi, LR+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1996::no title+Billingsley, P.+Probability and Measure+1995::CONSISTENCY OF BAYESIAN PROCEDURES FOR VARIABLE SELECTION+Casella, George; Giron, F.

The use of graphs generalizes the independence residual variation assumption of index models with a more complex yet still parsimonious alternative. Working with the dynamic matrix-variate graphical model framework, we develop general time-varying index models that are analytically tractable. In terms of methodology, we carefully explore strategies to deal with graph uncertainty and discuss the implementation of a novel computational tool to sequentially learn about the conditional independence relationships defining the model. Additionally, motivated by our applied context, we extend the DGM framework to accommodate random regressors. Finally, in a case study involving 100 stocks, we show that our proposed methodology is able to generate improvements in covariance forecasting and portfolio optimization problems.","Bayesian forecasting,Covariance matrix forecasting,Dynamic matrix-variate graphical models,Index models, Factor models,Gaussian graphical models,Portfolio selection","RISK,RETURNS","Wang, Hao@Univ S Carolina, Dept Stat, Columbia, SC 29208 USA::Reeson, Craig@Duke Univ, Dept Stat, Durham, NC USA::Carvalho, Carlos M.@Univ Texas Austin, McCombs Sch Business, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Wang, Hao@University of South Carolina Columbia@University of South Carolina@University of South Carolina System::Reeson, Craig@Duke University::Carvalho, Carlos M.@University of Texas Austin@University of Texas System",not exist,"Dynamic Matrix-Variate Graphical Models - A synopsis+Carvalho, C.

Bayesian Outlier Detection with Dirichlet Process Mixtures,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/11-BA625,2011,53,11,"We introduce a Bayesian inference mechanism for outlier detection using the augmented Dirichlet process mixture. Outliers are detected by forming a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the data partition. Observations that comprise small or singleton clusters in the estimated partition are considered outliers. We offer a novel interpretation of the Dirichlet process precision parameter, and demonstrate its utility in outlier detection problems. The precision parameter is used to form an outlier detection criterion based on the Bayes factor for an outlier partition versus a class of partitions with fewer or no outliers. We further introduce a computational method for MAP estimation that is free of posterior sampling, and guaranteed to find a MAP estimate in finite time.

Posterior Predictive p-Values with Fisher Randomization Tests in Noncompliance Settings: Test Statistics vs Discrepancy Measures,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/17-BA1062,SEP 2018,26,0,"In randomized experiments with noncompliance, one might wish to focus on compliers rather than on the overall sample. In this vein, Rubin (1998) argued that testing for the complier average causal effect and averaging permutationbased p-values over the posterior distribution of the compliance types could increase power as compared to general intent-to-treat tests. The general scheme is a repeated two-step process: impute missing compliance types and conduct a permutation test with the completed data. In this paper, we explore this idea further, comparing the use of discrepancy measures-which depend on unknown but imputed parameters-to classical test statistics and contrasting different approaches for imputing the unknown compliance types. We also examine consequences of model misspecification in the imputation step, and discuss to what extent this additional modeling undercuts the advantage of permutation tests being model independent. We find that, especially for discrepancy measures, modeling choices can impact both power and validity. In particular, imputing missing compliance types under the null can radically reduce power, but not doing so can jeopardize validity. Fortunately, using covariates predictive of compliance type in the imputation can mitigate these results. We also compare this overall approach to Bayesian model-based tests, that is, tests that are directly derived from posterior credible intervals, under both correct and incorrect model specification.","posterior predictive p-values (PPPV),permutation testing,noncompliance,principal stratification,complier average causal effects (CACE)","IDENTIFICATION,DISTRIBUTIONS","Forastiere, Laura@Univ Florence, Dept Stat, Comp Sci, Applicat, Florence, Italy::Mealli, Fabrizia@Univ Florence, Dept Stat, Comp Sci, Applicat, Florence, Italy::Miratrix, Luke@Harvard Grad Sch Educ, Cambridge, MA USA","Forastiere, Laura@University of Florence::Mealli, Fabrizia@University of Florence::Miratrix, Luke@Harvard University",not exist,"Identification of causal effects using instrumental variables+Angrist, JD; Imbens, GW; Rubin, DB+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1996::The arrangement of field experiments+Fisher, R.

The algorithm is tested on two examples, the mean regression problem with normal errors, and the reconstruction of two dimensional CT images. In a second time, we establish posterior rates of convergence related to the mean regression problem with normal errors. For location-scale and location-modulation mixtures the rates are adaptive over Holder classes, and in the case of location-modulation mixtures are nearly optimal.","Bayesian nonparameterics,nonparametric regression,signed random measures","MULTIVARIATE DENSITY-ESTIMATION,STOCHASTIC EXPANSIONS,ASYMPTOTICS,REGRESSION,HAZARDS,RATES","Naulet, Zacharic@CEA, LIST, Lab Modeling Simulat & Syst, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France::Barat, Eric@CEA, LIST, Lab Modeling Simulat & Syst, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France","Naulet, Zacharic@CEA@Universite Paris Saclay (ComUE)::Barat, Eric@CEA@Universite Paris Saclay (ComUE)",not exist,"Stochastic expansions in an overcomplete wavelet dictionary+Abramovich, F; Sapatinas, T; Silverman, BW+PROBABILITY THEORY AND RELATED FIELDS+MAY 2000::Wavelet estimators in nonparametric regression: a comparative study+Antoniadis, A.; Bigot, J.; Sapatinas, T.+Journal of Statistical Software+2001::Le'vy-based tempo-spatial modelling; with applications to turbulence+Barndorff-Nielsen, O.

Power-Expected-Posterior Priors for Generalized Linear Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/17-BA1066,SEP 2018,39,0,"The power-expected-posterior (PEP) prior provides an objective, automatic, consistent and parsimonious model selection procedure. At the same time it resolves the conceptual and computational problems due to the use of imaginary data. Namely, (i) it dispenses with the need to select and average across all possible minimal imaginary samples, and (ii) it diminishes the effect that the imaginary data have upon the posterior distribution. These attributes allow for large sample approximations, when needed, in order to reduce the computational burden under more complex models. In this work we generalize the applicability of the PEP methodology, focusing on the framework of generalized linear models (GLMs), by introducing two new PEP definitions which are in effect applicable to any general model setting. Hyper-prior extensions for the power parameter that regulates the contribution of the imaginary data are introduced. We further study the validity of the predictive matching and of the model selection consistency, providing analytical proofs for the former and empirical evidence supporting the latter. For estimation of posterior model and inclusion probabilities we introduce a tuning-free Gibbs-based variable selection sampler. Several simulation scenarios and one real life example are considered in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods compared to other commonly used approaches based on mixtures of g-priors. Results indicate that the GLM-PEP priors are more effective in the identification of sparse and parsimonious model formulations.","expected-posterior prior,g-prior,generalized linear models,hyper-g priors,imaginary data,objective Bayesian model selection,power-prior","BAYESIAN VARIABLE SELECTION,PRIOR DISTRIBUTIONS,REGRESSION-MODELS,CONJUGATE PRIORS,COMPUTATION,CRITERIA","Fouskakis, Dimitris@Natl Tech Univ Athens, Dept Math, Athens 15780, Greece::Ntzoufras, Ioannis@Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Stat, Athens 10434, Greece::Perrakis, Konstantinos@Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Stat, Athens 10434, Greece@German Ctr Neurodegenerat Dis DZNE, D-53127 Bonn, Germany","Fouskakis, Dimitris@National Technical University of Athens::Ntzoufras, Ioannis@Athens University of Economics & Business::Perrakis, Konstantinos@Athens University of Economics & Business@German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)@Helmholtz Association",not exist,"CRITERIA FOR BAYESIAN MODEL CHOICE WITH APPLICATION TO VARIABLE SELECTION+Bayarri, M.

Variable Selection via Penalized Credible Regions with Dirichlet-Laplace Global-Local Shrinkage Priors,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/17-BA1076,SEP 2018,32,0,"The method of Bayesian variable selection via penalized credible regions separates model fitting and variable selection. The idea is to search for the sparsest solution within the joint posterior credible regions. Although the approach was successful, it depended on the use of conjugate normal priors. More recently, improvements in the use of global-local shrinkage priors have been made for high-dimensional Bayesian variable selection. In this paper, we incorporate global-local priors into the credible region selection framework. The Dirichlet-Laplace (DL) prior is adapted to linear regression. Posterior consistency for the normal and DL priors are shown, along with variable selection consistency. We further introduce a new method to tune hyperparameters in prior distributions for linear regression. We propose to choose the hyperparameters to minimize a discrepancy between the induced distribution on R-square and a prespecified target distribution. Prior elicitation on R-square is more natural, particularly when there are a large number of predictor variables in which elicitation on that scale is not feasible. For a normal prior, these hyperparameters are available in closed form to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the distributions.","variable selection,posterior credible region,global-local shrinkage prior,Dirichlet-Laplace,posterior consistency,hyperparameter tuning","REGRESSION SHRINKAGE,ORACLE PROPERTIES,ADAPTIVE LASSO,LINEAR-MODELS,ELASTIC NET","Zhang, Yan@Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biostat, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA::Bondell, Howard D.@North Carolina State Univ, Dept Stat, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Zhang, Yan@Johns Hopkins University::Bondell, Howard D.@North Carolina State University@University of North Carolina",not exist,"Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principle+Akaike, H.+INFORM THEORY EXTENS+1973::Estimation and variable selection with exponential weights+Arias-Castro, Ery; Lounici, Karim+ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+2014::Posterior consistency in linear models under shrinkage priors+Armagan, A.; Dunson, D.

A New Regression Model for Bounded Responses,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/17-BA1079,SEP 2018,32,0,"Aim of this contribution is to propose a new regression model for continuous variables bounded to the unit interval (e.g. proportions) based on the flexible beta (FB) distribution. The latter is a special mixture of two betas, which greatly extends the shapes of the beta distribution mainly in terms of asymmetry, bimodality and heavy tail behaviour. Its special mixture structure ensures good theoretical properties, such as strong identifiability and likelihood boundedness, quite uncommon for mixture models. Moreover, it makes the model computationally very tractable also within the Bayesian framework here adopted.

At the same time, the FB regression model displays easiness of interpretation as well as remarkable fitting capacity for a variety of data patterns, including unimodal and bimodal ones, heavy tails and presence of outliers. Indeed, simulation studies and applications to real datasets show a general better performance of the FB regression model with respect to competing ones, namely the beta (Ferrari and Cribari-Neto, 2004) and the beta rectangular (Bayes et al., 2012), in terms of precision of estimates, goodness of fit and posterior predictive intervals.","proportions,beta regression,flexible beta,mixture models,MCMC,outliers,heavy tails","BETA REGRESSION,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,PROPORTIONS,DENSITIES","Migliorati, Sonia@Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ Management & Stat, Milan, Italy::Di Brisco, Agnese Maria@Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ Management & Stat, Milan, Italy::Ongaro, Andrea@Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ Management & Stat, Milan, Italy","Migliorati, Sonia@University of Milano-Bicocca::Di Brisco, Agnese Maria@University of Milano-Bicocca::Ongaro, Andrea@University of Milano-Bicocca",not exist,"Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principle+Akaike, H.+P 2 INT S INF THEOR+1973::An Introduction to R+Albert, Jim+BAYESIAN COMPUTATION WITH R, SECOND EDITION+2009::A New Robust Regression Model for Proportions+Bayes, Cristian L.; Bazan, Jorge L.; Garcia, Catalina+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2012::Bayesian beta regression: Applications to household expenditure data and genetic distance between foot-and-mouth disease viruses+Branscum, Adam J.; Johnson, Wesley O.; Thurmond, Mark C.+AUSTRALIAN &amp; NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+SEP 2007::Discussion on the paper by Spiegelhalter, Best, Carlin and Van Der Linde+Brooks, S.+DISCUSSION PAPER SPI+2002::Deviance Information Criteria for Missing Data Models+Celeux, G.; Forbes, F.; Robert, C.

This paper provides the first explanation of the two main sources of sampling errors in nested sampling parameter estimation, and presents a new diagrammatic representation for the process. We find no current method can accurately measure the parameter estimation errors of a single nested sampling run, and propose a method for doing so using a new algorithm for dividing nested sampling runs.

Sampling Latent States for High-Dimensional Non-Linear State Space Models with the Embedded HMM Method,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/17-BA1077,SEP 2018,15,0,"We propose a new scheme for selecting pool states for the embedded Hidden Markov Model (HMM) Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. This new scheme allows the embedded HMM method to be used for efficient sampling in state space models where the state can be high-dimensional. Previously, embedded HMM methods were only applicable to low-dimensional state-space models. We demonstrate that using our proposed pool state selection scheme, an embedded HMM sampler can have similar performance to a well-tuned sampler that uses a combination of Particle Gibbs with Backward Sampling (PGBS) and Metropolis updates. The scaling to higher dimensions is made possible by selecting pool states locally near the current value of the state sequence. The proposed pool state selection scheme also allows each iteration of the embedded HMM sampler to take time linear in the number of the pool states, as opposed to quadratic as in the original embedded HMM sampler.","MCMC,non-linear,state space",SIMULATION,"Shestopaloff, Alexander Y.@Univ Toronto, Dept Stat Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada::Neal, Radford M.@Univ Toronto, Dept Stat Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada@Univ Toronto, Dept Comp Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada","Shestopaloff, Alexander Y.@University of Toronto::Neal, Radford M.@University of Toronto",not exist,"Particle Markov chain Monte Carlo methods+Andrieu, Christophe; Doucet, Arnaud; Holenstein, Roman+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2010::An introduction to sequential Monte Carlo methods+Doucet, A; de Freitas, N; Gordon, N+SEQUENTIAL MONTE CARLO METHODS IN PRACTICE+2001::On embedded hidden Markov models and particle Markov chain Monte Carlo methods+Finke, A.; Doucet, A.; Johansen, A.

A New Monte Carlo Method for Estimating Marginal Likelihoods,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/17-BA1049,JUN 2018,26,0,"Evaluating the marginal likelihood in Bayesian analysis is essential for model selection. Estimators based on a single Markov chain Monte Carlo sample from the posterior distribution include the harmonic mean estimator and the inflated density ratio estimator. We propose a new class of Monte Carlo estimators based on this single Markov chain Monte Carlo sample. This class can be thought of as a generalization of the harmonic mean and inflated density ratio estimators using a partition weighted kernel (likelihood times prior). We show that our estimator is consistent and has better theoretical properties than the harmonic mean and inflated density ratio estimators. In addition, we provide guidelines on choosing optimal weights. Simulation studies were conducted to examine the empirical performance of the proposed estimator. We further demonstrate the desirable features of the proposed estimator with two real data sets: one is from a prostate cancer study using an ordinal probit regression model with latent variables; the other is for the power prior construction from two Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group phase III clinical trials using the cure rate survival model with similar objectives.","Bayesian model selection,cure rate model,harmonic mean estimator,inflated density ratio estimator,ordinal probit regression,power prior","BAYESIAN-INFERENCE,MODEL,OUTPUT,INTEGRATION,SAMPLER","Wang, Yu-Bo@Univ Connecticut, Dept Stat, Storrs, CT 06269 USA::Chen, Ming-Hui@Univ Connecticut, Dept Stat, Storrs, CT 06269 USA::Kuo, Lynn@Univ Connecticut, Dept Stat, Storrs, CT 06269 USA::Lewis, Paul O.@Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA","Wang, Yu-Bo@University of Connecticut::Chen, Ming-Hui@University of Connecticut::Kuo, Lynn@University of Connecticut::Lewis, Paul O.@University of Connecticut",not exist,"BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS OF BINARY AND POLYCHOTOMOUS RESPONSE DATA+ALBERT, JH; CHIB, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1993::Partition-weighted Monte Carlo estimation+Chen, MH; Shao, QM+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+JUN 2002::A new Bayesian model for survival data with a surviving fraction+Chen, MH; Ibrahim, JG; Sinha, D+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1999::Computing marginal likelihoods from a single MCMC output+Chen, MH+STATISTICA NEERLANDICA+FEB 2005::Discussion of ""equi-energy sampler"" by Kou, Zhou and Wong+Chen, Ming-Hui; Kim, Sungduk+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+AUG 2006::Marginal likelihood from the Metropolis-Hastings output+Chib, S; Jeliazkov, I+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2001::Marginal likelihood from the Gibbs output+Chib, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1995::Choosing among Partition Models in Bayesian Phylogenetics+Fan, Yu; Wu, Rui; Chen, Ming-Hui; et al.+MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION+JAN 2011::Marginal likelihood estimation via power posteriors+Friel, N.; Pettitt, A.

On the Use of Cauchy Prior Distributions for Bayesian Logistic Regression,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/17-BA1051,JUN 2018,44,3,"In logistic regression, separation occurs when a linear combination of the predictors can perfectly classify part or all of the observations in the sample, and as a result, finite maximum likelihood estimates of the regression coefficients do not exist. Gelman et al. (2008) recommended independent Cauchy distributions as default priors for the regression coefficients in logistic regression, even in the case of separation, and reported posterior modes in their analyses. As the mean does not exist for the Cauchy prior, a natural question is whether the posterior means of the regression coefficients exist under separation. We prove theorems that provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of posterior means under independent Cauchy priors for the logit link and a general family of link functions, including the probit link. We also study the existence of posterior means under multivariate Cauchy priors. For full Bayesian inference, we develop a Gibbs sampler based on Polya-Gamma data augmentation to sample from the posterior distribution under independent Student-t priors including Cauchy priors, and provide a companion R package tglm, available at CRAN. We demonstrate empirically that even when the posterior means of the regression coefficients exist under separation, the magnitude of the posterior samples for Cauchy priors may be unusually large, and the corresponding Gibbs sampler shows extremely slow mixing. While alternative algorithms such as the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) in Stan can greatly improve mixing, in order to resolve the issue of extremely heavy tailed posteriors for Cauchy priors under separation, one would need to consider lighter tailed priors such as normal priors or Student-t priors with degrees of freedom larger than one.","binary regression,existence of posterior mean,Markov chain Monte Carlo,probit regression,separation,slow mixing","GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,RESPONSE MODELS,SEPARATION,EXISTENCE,PROPRIETY,SAMPLER,BINARY","Ghosh, Joyee@Univ Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA::Li, Yingbo@Clemson Univ, Clemson, SC USA::Mitra, Robin@Univ Southampton, Southampton, Hants, England","Ghosh, Joyee@University of Iowa::Li, Yingbo@Clemson University::Mitra, Robin@University of Southampton",not exist,No cited
Sequential Bayesian Analysis of Multivariate Count Data,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/17-BA1054,JUN 2018,41,1,"We develop a new class of dynamic multivariate Poisson count models that allow for fast online updating. We refer to this class as multivariate Poisson-scaled beta (MPSB) models. The MPSB model allows for serial dependence in count data as well as dependence with a random common environment across time series. Notable features of our model are analytic forms for state propagation, predictive likelihood densities, and sequential updating via sufficient statistics for the static model parameters. Our approach leads to a fully adapted particle learning algorithm and a new class of predictive likelihoods and marginal distributions which we refer to as the (dynamic) multivariate confluent hyper-geometric negative binomial distribution (MCHG-NB) and the dynamic multivariate negative binomial (DMNB) distribution, respectively. To illustrate our methodology, we use a simulation study and empirical data on weekly consumer non-durable goods demand.","state space,count time series,multivariate poisson,scaled beta prior,particle learning","STATE-SPACE MODELS,TIME-SERIES,POISSON-PROCESS","Aktekin, Tevfik@Univ New Hampshire, Peter T Paul Coll Business & Econ, Durham, NH 03824 USA::Polson, Nick@Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA::Soyer, Refik@George Washington Univ, Sch Business, Washington, DC USA","Aktekin, Tevfik@University System Of New Hampshire@University of New Hampshire::Polson, Nick@University of Chicago::Soyer, Refik@George Washington University",not exist,"no title+Abramowitz, M.; Stegun, I.+Handbook of Mathematical Functions Number 55+1968::Supplementary Appendices for  Sequential Bayesian Analysis of Multivariate Count Data+Aktekin, T.; Polson, N.; Soyer, R.+Bayesian Analysis+2017::ASSESSMENT OF MORTGAGE DEFAULT RISK VIA BAYESIAN STATE SPACE MODELS+Aktekin, Tevfik; Soyer, Refik; Xu, Feng+ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS+SEP 2013::Bayesian analysis of queues with impatient customers: Applications to call centers+Aktekin, Tevfik; Soyer, Refik+NAVAL RESEARCH LOGISTICS+SEP 2012::Call Center Arrival Modeling: A Bayesian State-Space Approach+Aktekin, Tevfik; Soyer, Refik+NAVAL RESEARCH LOGISTICS+FEB 2011::First order integer-valued autoregressive (INAR(1)) process+Al-Osh, M.; Alzaid, A.+J.

Bayesian Analysis of RNA-Seq Data Using a Family of Negative Binomial Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/17-BA1055,JUN 2018,34,0,"The analysis of RNA-Seq data has been focused on three main categories, including gene expression, relative exon usage and transcript expression. Methods have been proposed independently for each category using a negative binomial (NB) model. However, counts following a NB distribution on one feature (e.g., exon) do not guarantee a NB distribution for the other two features (e.g., gene/transcript). In this paper we propose a family of Negative Binomial models, which integrates the gene, exon and transcript analysis under a coherent NB model. The proposed model easily incorporates the uncertainty of assigning reads to transcripts and simplifies substantially the estimation for the relative usage. We developed simple Gibbs sampling algorithms for the posterior inference by exploiting fully tractable closed-forms of computation via suitable conjugate priors. The proposed models were investigated under extensive simulations. Finally, we applied our model to a real data set.","Bayesian RNA-Seq,Chinese restaurant table distribution,differential test,exon usage,transcript analysis","GENE-EXPRESSION,SEQUENCING DATA,PACKAGE,COUNT","Zhao, Lili@Univ Michigan, Dept Biostat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA::Wu, Weisheng@Univ Michigan, Dept Computat Med & Bioinformat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA::Feng, Dai@Merck Res Labs, Biometr Res Dept, Boston, MA USA::Jiang, Hui@Univ Michigan, Dept Biostat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA::Nguyen, XuanLong@Univ Michigan, Dept Stat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Zhao, Lili@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan::Wu, Weisheng@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan::Feng, Dai@Merck & Company::Jiang, Hui@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan::Nguyen, XuanLong@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan",not exist,"Logratio analysis and compositional distance+Aitchison, J; Barcelo-Vidal, C; Martin-Fernandez, JA; et al.+MATHEMATICAL GEOLOGY+APR 2000::Differential expression analysis for sequence count data+Anders, Simon; Huber, Wolfgang+GENOME BIOLOGY+2010::Detecting differential usage of exons from RNA-seq data+Anders, Simon; Reyes, Alejandro; Huber, Wolfgang+GENOME RESEARCH+OCT 2012::Conservation of an RNA regulatory map between Drosophila and mammals+Brooks, Angela N.; Yang, Li; Duff, Michael O.; et al.+GENOME RESEARCH+FEB 2011::no title+Chen, M.; Shao, Q.; Ibrahim, J.+MONTE CARLO METHODS+2000::Polymorphic Cis- and Trans-Regulation of Human Gene Expression+Cheung, Vivian G.; Nayak, Renuka R.; Wang, Isabel Xiaorong; et al.+PLOS BIOLOGY+SEP 2010::The NBP Negative Binomial Model for Assessing Differential Gene Expression from RNA-Seq+Di, Yanming; Schafer, Daniel W.; Cumbie, Jason S.; et al.+STATISTICAL APPLICATIONS IN GENETICS AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY+2011::A comprehensive evaluation of normalization methods for Illumina high-throughput RNA sequencing data analysis+Dillies, Marie-Agnes; Rau, Andrea; Aubert, Julie; et al.+BRIEFINGS IN BIOINFORMATICS+NOV 2013::BAYESIAN MODEL CHOICE - ASYMPTOTICS AND EXACT CALCULATIONS+GELFAND, AE; DEY, DK+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1994::baySeq: Empirical Bayesian methods for identifying differential expression in sequence count data+Hardcastle, Thomas J.; Kelly, Krystyna A.+BMC BIOINFORMATICS+AUG 10 2010::Deletions of chromosomal regulatory boundaries are associated with congenital disease+Ibn-Salem, Jonas; Koehler, Sebastian; Love, Michael I.; et al.+GENOME BIOLOGY+2014::no title+Ibrahim, J.

Efficient Model Comparison Techniques for Models Requiring Large Scale Data Augmentation,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/17-BA1057,JUN 2018,39,0,"Selecting between competing statistical models is a challenging problem especially when the competing models are non-nested. In this paper we offer a simple solution by devising an algorithm which combines MCMC and importance sampling to obtain computationally efficient estimates of the marginal likelihood which can then be used to compare the models. The algorithm is successfully applied to a longitudinal epidemic data set, where calculating the marginal likelihood is made more challenging by the presence of large amounts of missing data. In this context, our importance sampling approach is shown to outperform existing methods for computing the marginal likelihood.","epidemics,marginal likelihood,model evidence,model selection","EXACT BAYESIAN-INFERENCE,MARGINAL LIKELIHOOD,PNEUMOCOCCAL CARRIAGE,MCMC,DISEASE,OUTPUT,TRANSMISSION,HOUSEHOLDS,EPIDEMICS,SELECTION","Touloupou, Panayiota@Univ Warwick, Dept Stat, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England::Alzahrani, Naif@Univ Lancaster, Dept Math & Stat, Lancaster LA1 4YF, England::Neal, Peter@Univ Lancaster, Dept Math & Stat, Lancaster LA1 4YF, England::Spencer, Simon E.

Testing Un-Separated Hypotheses by Estimating a Distance,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/17-BA1059,JUN 2018,39,1,"In this paper we propose a Bayesian answer to testing problems when the hypotheses are not well separated. The idea of the method is to study the posterior distribution of a discrepancy measure between the parameter and the model we want to test for. This is shown to be equivalent to a modification of the testing loss. An advantage of this approach is that it can easily be adapted to complex hypotheses testing which are in general difficult to test for. Asymptotic properties of the test can be derived from the asymptotic behaviour of the posterior distribution of the discrepancy measure, and gives insight on possible calibrations. In addition one can derive separation rates for testing, which ensure the asymptotic frequentist optimality of our procedures.","hypothesis testing,Bayesian inference,asymptotic properties of tests,nonparametric inference,goodness-of-fit,monotonicity","POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTIONS,CONVERGENCE-RATES,POINT NULL,REGRESSION,MONOTONICITY,DENSITY","Salomond, Jean-Bernard@Univ Paris Est, Lab Anal & Math Appl UMR 8050, UPEM, UPEC,CNRS, F-94010 Creteil, France","Salomond, Jean-Bernard@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)@University of Paris-Est Creteil@Universite Paris-Est Marne-la-Vallee",not exist,"Testing monotonicity via local least concave majorants+Akakpo, Nathalie; Balabdaoui, Fadoua; Durot, Cecile+BERNOULLI+MAY 2014::Testing convex hypotheses on the mean of a Gaussian vector.

Variational Hamiltonian Monte Carlo via Score Matching,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/17-BA1060,JUN 2018,40,0,"Traditionally, the field of computational Bayesian statistics has been divided into two main subfields: variational methods and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). In recent years, however, several methods have been proposed based on combining variational Bayesian inference and MCMC simulation in order to improve their overall accuracy and computational efficiency. This marriage of fast evaluation and flexible approximation provides a promising means of designing scalable Bayesian inference methods. In this paper, we explore the possibility of incorporating variational approximation into a state-of-the-art MCMC method, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), to reduce the required expensive computation involved in the sampling procedure, which is the bottleneck for many applications of HMC in big data problems. To this end, we exploit the regularity in parameter space to construct a free-form approximation of the target distribution by a fast and flexible surrogate function using an optimized additive model of proper random basis, which can also be viewed as a single-hidden layer feedforward neural network. The surrogate function provides sufficiently accurate approximation while allowing for fast computation in the sampling procedure, resulting in an efficient approximate Bayesian inference algorithm. We demonstrate the advantages of our proposed method using both synthetic and real data problems.","Markov Chain Monte Carlo,variational inference,free-form approximation","APPROXIMATION,REGRESSION,NETWORKS,MODELS","Zhang, Cheng@UC Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697 USA::Shahbaba, Babak@UC Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697 USA::Zhao, Hongkai@UC Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697 USA","Zhang, Cheng@University of California Irvine@University of California System::Shahbaba, Babak@University of California Irvine@University of California System::Zhao, Hongkai@University of California Irvine@University of California System",not exist,"Bayesian Posterior Sampling via Stochastic Gradient Fisher Scoring+Ahn, S.; Korattikara, A.; Welling, M.+P 29 INT C MACH LEAR+2012::no title+Albert, J.+Bayesian Computing with R+2009::A new learning algorithm for blind signal separation+Amari, S; Cichocki, A; Yang, HH+ADVANCES IN NEURAL INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS 8: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 1995 CONFERENCE+1996::The variational Bayesian EM algorithm for incomplete data: with application to scoring graphical model structures+Beal, M.

Merging MCMC Subposteriors through Gaussian-Process Approximations,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/17-BA1063,JUN 2018,36,1,"Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms have become powerful tools for Bayesian inference. However, they do not scale well to large-data problems. Divide-and-conquer strategies, which split the data into batches and, for each batch, run independent MCMC algorithms targeting the corresponding subposterior, can spread the computational burden across a number of separate computer cores. The challenge with such strategies is in recombining the subposteriors to approximate the full posterior. By creating a Gaussian-process approximation for each log-subposterior density we create a tractable approximation for the full posterior. This approximation is exploited through three methodologies: firstly a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm targeting the expectation of the posterior density provides a sample from an approximation to the posterior; secondly, evaluating the true posterior at the sampled points leads to an importance sampler that, asymptotically, targets the true posterior expectations; finally, an alternative importance sampler uses the full Gaussian-process distribution of the approximation to the log-posterior density to re-weight any initial sample and provide both an estimate of the posterior expectation and a measure of the uncertainty in it.","big data,Markov chain Monte Carlo,Gaussian processes,distributed importance sampling","MONTE-CARLO ALGORITHM,LANGEVIN","Nemeth, Christopher@Univ Lancaster, Dept Math & Stat, Lancaster LA1 4YF, England::Sherlock, Chris@Univ Lancaster, Dept Math & Stat, Lancaster LA1 4YF, England","Nemeth, Christopher@Lancaster University::Sherlock, Chris@Lancaster University","Nemeth, Christopher@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9084-3866::Sherlock, Chris@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2429-3157","A tutorial on adaptive MCMC+Andrieu, Christophe; Thoms, Johannes+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+DEC 2008::Towards scaling up Markov chain Monte Carlo: An adaptive subsampling approach.+Bardenet,, R.; Doucet,, A.; Holmes,, C.+P 31 INT C MACH LEAR+2014::Optimal tuning of the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm+Beskos, Alexandros; Pillai, Natesh; Roberts, Gareth; et al.+BERNOULLI+NOV 2013::Stan: A probabilistic programming language+Carpenter, B.; Gelman, A.; Hoffman, M.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Lee, D.; Goodrich, B.; Betancourt, M</span>.+Journal of Statistical Software+2016::Stochastic gradient hamiltonian monte carlo+Chen, Tianqi; Fox, Emily; Guestrin, Carlos.+J MACH LEARN RES+2014::Sparse on-line Gaussian processes+Csato, L; Opper, M+NEURAL COMPUTATION+MAR 2002::Automatic model construction with Gaussian processes+Duvenaud, D.+THESIS+2014::no title+Fairbrother, J.; Nemeth, C.; Rischard, M.+GaussianProcesses. jl: A Non-parametric Bayes package for the Julia Language+2017::BAYESIAN-INFERENCE IN ECONOMETRIC-MODELS USING MONTE-CARLO INTEGRATION+GEWEKE, J+ECONOMETRICA+NOV 1989::Riemann manifold Langevin and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods+Girolami, Mark; Calderhead, Ben+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2011::NONPARAMETRIC DENSITY-ESTIMATION WITH A PARAMETRIC START+HJORT, NL; GLAD, IK+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 1995::The No-U-Turn Sampler: Adaptively Setting Path Lengths in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.+Hoffman, M; Gelman, A.+Journal of Machine Learning Research.+2014::no title+Huang, Z.; Gelman, A.+Sampling for Bayesian Computation with Large Datasets+2005::Sparse nonparametric density estimation in high dimensions using the rodeo+Liu, H; Lafferty, JD; Wasserman, LA.+P IEEE INT S MULT DE+2007::Firefly Monte Carlo: Exact MCMC with Subsets of Data+Maclaurin, D.; Adams, R.

Modeling Skewed Spatial Data Using a Convolution of Gaussian and Log-Gaussian Processes,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/17-BA1064,JUN 2018,38,0,"In spatial statistics, it is usual to consider a Gaussian process for spatial latent variables. As the data often exhibit non-normality, we introduce a novel skew process, named hereafter Gaussian-log Gaussian convolution (GLGC) to construct latent spatial models which provide great flexibility in capturing skewness. Some properties including closed-form expressions for the moments and the skewness of the GLGC process are derived. Particularly, we show that the mean square continuity and differentiability of the GLGC process are established by those of the Gaussian and log-Gaussian processes considered in its structure. Moreover, the usefulness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through the analysis of spatial data, including mixed ordinal and continuous outcomes that are jointly modeled through a common latent process. A fully Bayesian analysis is adopted to make inference. Our methodology is illustrated with simulation experiments as well as an environmental data set.","spatial process,skewness,slice sampling,mixed outcomes,misalignment","RESPONSE DATA,DISTRIBUTIONS,PREDICTION,LINK","Zareifard, Hamid@Jahrom Univ, Dept Stat, Jahrom 7413766171, Iran::Khaledi, Majid Jafari@Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Stat, Tehran, Iran::Rivaz, Firoozeh@Shahid Beheshti Univ, Fac Math Sci, Dept Stat, Tehran, Iran::Vahidi-Asl, Mohammad Q.@Shahid Beheshti Univ, Fac Math Sci, Dept Stat, Tehran, Iran","Zareifard, Hamid@Unknow::Khaledi, Majid Jafari@Tarbiat Modares University::Rivaz, Firoozeh@Unknow::Vahidi-Asl, Mohammad Q.@Unknow","rivaz, firoozeh@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7227-0435","Slice sampling for simulation based fitting of spatial data models+Agarwal, DK; Gelfand, AE+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+JAN 2005::Formulation and Estimation of Stochastic Frontier Production Function Models+Aigner, D.

Locally Adaptive Smoothing with Markov Random Fields and Shrinkage Priors,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/17-BA1050,MAR 2018,76,1,"We present a locally adaptive nonparametric curve fitting method that operates within a fully Bayesian framework. This method uses shrinkage priors to induce sparsity in order-k differences in the latent trend function, providing a combination of local adaptation and global control. Using a scale mixture of normals representation of shrinkage priors, we make explicit connections between our method and kth order Gaussian Markov random field smoothing. We call the resulting processes shrinkage prior Markov random fields (SPMRFs). We use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to approximate the posterior distribution of model parameters because this method provides superior performance in the presence of the high dimensionality and strong parameter correlations exhibited by our models. We compare the performance of three prior formulations using simulated data and find the horseshoe prior provides the best compromise between bias and precision. We apply SPMRF models to two benchmark data examples frequently used to test nonparametric methods. We find that this method is flexible enough to accommodate a variety of data generating models and offers the adaptive properties and computational tractability to make it a useful addition to the Bayesian nonparametric toolbox.","nonparametric,horseshoe prior,Levy process,Hamiltonian Monte Carlo","NONSTATIONARY COVARIANCE FUNCTIONS,MONTE-CARLO,REGRESSION SHRINKAGE,NORMAL-DISTRIBUTIONS,BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS,SPLINE FUNCTIONS,GAUSSIAN PROCESS,SCALE MIXTURES,TIME-SERIES,GAMMA PRIOR","Faulkner, James R.@Univ Washington, Quantitat Ecol & Resource Management, Seattle, WA 98195 USA@NOAA, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98112 USA::Minin, Vladimir N.@Univ Washington, Dept Stat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA@Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Faulkner, James R.@University of Washington@National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA@University of Washington Seattle::Minin, Vladimir N.@University of Washington@University of Washington Seattle",not exist,"Wavelet thresholding via a Bayesian approach+Abramovich, F; Sapatinas, T; Silverman, BW+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1998::Tractable nonparametric Bayesian infer-ence in Poisson processes with Gaussian process intensities+Adams, R.

Bayesian Spectral Modeling for Multivariate Spatial Distributions of Elemental Concentrations in Soil,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA1034,MAR 2018,50,0,"Recent technological advances have enabled researchers in a variety of fields to collect accurately geocoded data for several variables simultaneously. In many cases it may be most appropriate to jointly model these multivariate spatial processes without constraints on their conditional relationships. When data have been collected on a regular lattice, the multivariate conditionally autoregressive (MCAR) models are a common choice. However, inference from these MCAR models relies heavily on the pre-specified neighborhood structure and often assumes a separable covariance structure. Here, we present a multivariate spatial model using a spectral analysis approach that enables inference on the conditional relationships between the variables that does not rely on a pre-specified neighborhood structure, is non-separable, and is computationally efficient. Covariance and cross-covariance functions are defined in the spectral domain to obtain computational efficiency. The resulting pseudo posterior inference on the correlation matrix allows for quantification of the conditional dependencies. A comparison is made with an MCAR model that is shown to be highly sensitive to the choice of neighborhood. The approaches are illustrated for the toxic element arsenic and four other soil elements whose relative concentrations were measured on a microscale spatial lattice. Understanding conditional relationships between arsenic and other soil elements provides insights for mitigating pervasive arsenic poisoning in drinking water in southern Asia and elsewhere.","conditional dependence,lattice,non-separable covariance,quasi-matern spectral density,spatial modeling","MARKOV RANDOM-FIELDS,PARAMETER-ESTIMATION,STATIONARY PROCESS,AREAL DATA,LATTICE,LIKELIHOOD,COMPONENTS,NUMBER","Terres, Maria A.@North Carolina State Univ, Dept Stat, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA@Climate Corp, San Francisco, CA 94103 USA::Fuentes, Montserrat@North Carolina State Univ, Dept Stat, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA@Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Med Coll Virginia Campus, Richmond, VA 23284 USA::Hesterberg, Dean@North Carolina State Univ, Soil Sci Dept, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA::Polizzotto, Matthew@North Carolina State Univ, Soil Sci Dept, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Terres, Maria A.@North Carolina State University@University of North Carolina::Fuentes, Montserrat@Virginia Commonwealth University@North Carolina State University@University of North Carolina::Hesterberg, Dean@North Carolina State University@University of North Carolina::Polizzotto, Matthew@North Carolina State University@University of North Carolina",not exist,"A Valid Matern Class of Cross-Covariance Functions for Multivariate Random Fields With Any Number of Components+Apanasovich, Tatiyana V.; Genton, Marc G.; Sun, Ying+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2012::no title+Banerjee, S.; Carlin, B.

Bayesian Inference and Testing of Group Differences in Brain Networks,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA1030,MAR 2018,65,2,"Network data are increasingly collected along with other variables of interest. Our motivation is drawn from neurophysiology studies measuring brain connectivity networks for a sample of individuals along with their membership to a low or high creative reasoning group. It is of paramount importance to develop statistical methods for testing of global and local changes in the structural inter-connections among brain regions across groups. We develop a general Bayesian procedure for inference and testing of group differences in the network structure, which relies on a nonparametric representation for the conditional probability mass function associated with a network-valued random variable. By leveraging a mixture of low-rank factorizations, we allow simple global and local hypothesis testing adjusting for multiplicity. An efficient Gibbs sampler is defined for posterior computation. We provide theoretical results on the flexibility of the model and assess testing performance in simulations. The approach is applied to provide novel insights on the relationships between human brain networks and creativity.","brain network,mixture model,multiple testing,nonparametric Bayes","FALSE DISCOVERY RATE,MARKOV GRAPHS,P-VALUES,MODELS,CREATIVITY,MISSPECIFICATION,CONSEQUENCES,REGRESSION,FIT","Durante, Daniele@Univ Padua, Dept Stat Sci, Via Cesare Battisti 241, I-35121 Padua, Italy::Dunson, David B.@Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Box 90251, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Durante, Daniele@University of Padua::Dunson, David B.@Duke University","Durante, Daniele@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8595-6719","no title+AGRESTI, A.+Categorical Data Analysis+2002::Mixed Membership Stochastic Blockmodels+Airoldi, Edoardo M.; Blei, David M.; Fienberg, Stephen E.; et al.+JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH+SEP 2008::Neuroimaging creativity: A psychometric view+Arden, Rosalind; Chavez, Robert S.; Grazioplene, Rachael; et al.+BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH+DEC 10 2010::ON THE CONSEQUENCES OF MODEL MISSPECIFICATION IN LOGISTIC-REGRESSION+BEGG, MD; LAGAKOS, S+ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES+JUL 1990::CONTROLLING THE FALSE DISCOVERY RATE - A PRACTICAL AND POWERFUL APPROACH TO MULTIPLE TESTING+BENJAMINI, Y; HOCHBERG, Y+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1995::Testing precise hypotheses+Berger, J.

Approximation of Bayesian Predictive p-Values with Regression ABC,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA1033,MAR 2018,37,2,"In the Bayesian framework a standard approach to model criticism is to compare some function of the observed data to a reference predictive distribution. The result of the comparison can be summarized in the form of a p-value, and computation of some kinds of Bayesian predictive p-values can be challenging. The use of regression adjustment approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) methods is explored for this task. Two problems are considered. The first is approximation of distributions of prior predictive p-values for the purpose of choosing weakly informative priors in the case where the model checking statistic is expensive to compute. Here the computation is difficult because of the need to repeatedly sample from a prior predictive distribution for different values of a prior hyperparameter. The second problem considered is the calibration of posterior predictive p-values so that they are uniformly distributed under some reference distribution for the data. Computation is difficult because the calibration process requires repeated approximation of the posterior for different data sets under the reference distribution. In both these problems we argue that high accuracy in the computations is not required, which makes fast approximations such as regression adjustment ABC very useful. We illustrate our methods with several examples.","ABC,Bayesian inference,Bayesian p-values,posterior predictive check,prior predictive check,weakly informative prior","COMPOSITE NULL MODELS,HIERARCHICAL-MODELS,COMPUTATION,CHECKING,CONFLICT,DISTRIBUTIONS,INFERENCE","Nott, David J.@Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Stat & Appl Probabil, Singapore 117546, Singapore::Drovandi, Christopher C.@Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Math Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia::Mengersen, Kerrie@Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Math Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia::Evans, Michael@Univ Toronto, Dept Stat, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada","Nott, David J.@National University of Singapore::Drovandi, Christopher C.@Queensland University of Technology (QUT)::Mengersen, Kerrie@Queensland University of Technology (QUT)::Evans, Michael@University of Toronto",not exist,"Bayesian checking of the second levels of hierarchical models+Bayarri, M.

Latent Marked Poisson Process with Applications to Object Segmentation,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA1035,MAR 2018,51,0,"In difficult object segmentation tasks, utilizing image information alone is not sufficient; incorporation of object shape prior models is necessary to obtain competitive segmentation performance. Most formulations that incorporate both shape and image information are in the form of energy functional optimization problems. This paper introduces a Bayesian latent marked Poisson process for segmenting multiple objects in an image. The model takes both shape and image feature/appearance into account-it generates object locations from a spatial Poisson process, then generates shape parameters from a shape prior model as the latent marks. Inferentially, this partitions the image: pixels inside objects are assumed to be generated from an object observation/appearance model and pixels outside objects come from a background model. The Poisson process provides (non-homogeneous) spatial priors for object locations and the marks allow the incorporation of shape priors. We develop a hybrid Gibbs sampler that addresses the variation in model order and nonconjugacy that arise in this setting and we present experimental results on synthetic images and two diverse domains in real images: cell segmentation in biological images and pedestrian and car detection in traffic images.","spatial Poisson process,segmentation,Bayesian nonparametrics,object detection","IMAGE SEGMENTATION,RANDOM-FIELDS,SHAPE,DISTRIBUTIONS,APPEARANCE,TEXTURE,DENSITY,MODELS","Ghanta, Sindhu@Parallel Machines, Sunnyvale, CA 94085 USA::Dy, Jennifer G.@Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA::Niu, Donglin@Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA::Jordan, Michael I.@Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Ghanta, Sindhu@Unknow::Dy, Jennifer G.@Northeastern University::Niu, Donglin@Northeastern University::Jordan, Michael I.@University of California System@University of California Berkeley",not exist,"Tractable nonparametric Bayesian infer-ence in Poisson processes with Gaussian process intensities+Adams, R.

Real-Time Bayesian Parameter Estimation for Item Response Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA1043,MAR 2018,54,0,"Bayesian item response models have been used in modeling educational testing and Internet ratings data. Typically, the statistical analysis is carried out using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. However, these may not be computationally feasible when real-time data continuously arrive and online parameter estimation is needed. We develop an efficient algorithm based on a deterministic moment-matching method to adjust the parameters in real-time. The proposed online algorithm works well for two real datasets, achieving good accuracy but with considerably less computational time.","Bayesian inference,deterministic method,moment matching,online algorithm,Woodroofe-Stein's identity","SEQUENTIALLY DESIGNED EXPERIMENTS,WORD-OF-MOUTH,RASCH MODEL,APPROXIMATION,FRAMEWORK,INFERENCE","Weng, Ruby Chiu-Hsing@Natl Chengchi Univ, Taipei, Taiwan::Coad, D.

Improving the Efficiency of Fully Bayesian Optimal Design of Experiments Using Randomised Quasi-Monte Carlo,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA1045,MAR 2018,36,1,"Optimal experimental design is an important methodology for most efficiently allocating resources in an experiment to best achieve some goal. Bayesian experimental design considers the potential impact that various choices of the controllable variables have on the posterior distribution of the unknowns. Optimal Bayesian design involves maximising an expected utility function, which is an analytically intractable integral over the prior predictive distribution. These integrals are typically estimated via standard Monte Carlo methods. In this paper, we demonstrate that the use of randomised quasi-Monte Carlo can bring significant reductions to the variance of the estimated expected utility. This variance reduction can then lead to a more efficient optimisation algorithm for maximising the expected utility.","approximate Bayesian computation,evidence,experimental design,importance sampling,mutual information,Laplace approximation,quasi-Monte Carlo","MODELS,UNCERTAINTY,SIMULATION,ALGORITHM,TIMES","Drovandi, Christopher C.@Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Math Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia@ARC Ctr Excellence Math & Stat Frontiers ACEMS, Parkville, Vic, Australia::Minh-Ngoc Tran@Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia@ARC Ctr Excellence Math & Stat Frontiers ACEMS, Parkville, Vic, Australia","Drovandi, Christopher C.@Queensland University of Technology (QUT)::Minh-Ngoc Tran@University of Sydney",not exist,"no title+Berger,, J.+Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis+1985::no title+Bernardo, J.; Smith, A.+Bayesian Theory+2000::Approximation of Bayesian efficiency in experimental choice designs+Bliemer, M.C.J.; Rose, J.M.; Hess, S.+J.

Regularization and Confounding in Linear Regression for Treatment Effect Estimation,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA1044,MAR 2018,27,1,"This paper investigates the use of regularization priors in the context of treatment effect estimation using observational data where the number of control variables is large relative to the number of observations. First, the phenomenon of ""regularization-induced confounding"" is introduced, which refers to the tendency of regularization priors to adversely bias treatment effect estimates by over-shrinking control variable regression coefficients. Then, a simultaneous regression model is presented which permits regularization priors to be specified in a way that avoids this unintentional ""re-confounding"". The new model is illustrated on synthetic and empirical data.","causal inference,observational data,shrinkage estimation","VARIABLE SELECTION,PROPENSITY SCORE,UNCERTAINTY,INFERENCE,OUTCOMES,MODELS","Hahn, P.

Dirichlet Process Mixture Models for Modeling and Generating Synthetic Versions of Nested Categorical Data,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA1047,MAR 2018,34,2,"We present a Bayesian model for estimating the joint distribution of multivariate categorical data when units are nested within groups. Such data arise frequently in social science settings, for example, people living in households. The model assumes that (i) each group is a member of a group-level latent class, and (ii) each unit is a member of a unit-level latent class nested within its group-level latent class. This structure allows the model to capture dependence among units in the same group. It also facilitates simultaneous modeling of variables at both group and unit levels. We develop a version of the model that assigns zero probability to groups and units with physically impossible combinations of variables. We apply the model to estimate multivariate relationships in a subset of the American Community Survey. Using the estimated model, we generate synthetic household data that could be disseminated as redacted public use files.

Optimal Gaussian Approximations to the Posterior for Log-Linear Models with Diaconis-Ylvisaker Priors,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA1046,MAR 2018,26,0,"In contingency table analysis, sparse data is frequently encountered for even modest numbers of variables, resulting in non-existence of maximum likelihood estimates. A common solution is to obtain regularized estimates of the parameters of a log-linear model. Bayesian methods provide a coherent approach to regularization, but are often computationally intensive. Conjugate priors ease computational demands, but the conjugate Diaconis-Ylvisaker priors for the parameters of log-linear models do not give rise to closed form credible regions, complicating posterior inference. Here we derive the optimal Gaussian approximation to the posterior for log-linear models with Diaconis-Ylvisaker priors, and provide convergence rate and finite-sample bounds for the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the exact posterior and the optimal Gaussian approximation. We demonstrate empirically in simulations and a real data application that the approximation is highly accurate, even for modest sample sizes. We also propose a method for model selection using the approximation. The proposed approximation provides a computationally scalable approach to regularized estimation and approximate Bayesian inference for log-linear models.","credible region,conjugate prior,contingency table,Dirichet-Multinomial,Kullback-Leibler divergence,Laplace approximation","EXPONENTIAL-FAMILIES,MARGINAL DENSITIES","Johndrow, James@Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA::Bhattacharya, Anirban@Texas A&M Univ, Dept Stat, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Johndrow, James@Duke University::Bhattacharya, Anirban@Texas A&M University System@Texas A&M University College Station",not exist,"no title+Abramowitz, M.; Stegun, I.

Computationally Efficient Multivariate Spatio-Temporal Models for High-Dimensional Count-Valued Data (with Discussion),BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/17-BA1069,MAR 2018,61,0,"We introduce a computationally efficient Bayesian model for predicting high-dimensional dependent count-valued data. In this setting, the Poisson data model with a latent Gaussian process model has become the de facto model. However, this model can be difficult to use in high dimensional settings, where the data may be tabulated over different variables, geographic regions, and times. These computational difficulties are further exacerbated by acknowledging that count-valued data are naturally non-Gaussian. Thus, many of the current approaches, in Bayesian inference, require one to carefully calibrate a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique. We avoid MCMC methods that require tuning by developing a new conjugate multivariate distribution. Specifically, we introduce a multivariate log-gamma distribution and provide substantial methodological development of independent interest including: results regarding conditional distributions, marginal distributions, an asymptotic relationship with the multivariate normal distribution, and full-conditional distributions for a Gibbs sampler. To incorporate dependence between variables, regions, and time points, a multivariate spatio-temporal mixed effects model (MSTM) is used. To demonstrate our methodology we use data obtained from the US Census Bureau's Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program. In particular, our approach is motivated by the LEHD's Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWIs), which constitute current estimates of important US economic variables.","aggregation,American Community Survey,Bayesian hierarchical model,big data,Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program,Markov chain Monte Carlo,non-Gaussian,Quarterly Workforce Indicators","SPATIAL-FILTERING SPECIFICATION,CHAIN MONTE-CARLO,GAMMA-DISTRIBUTIONS,AREAL DATA,STATISTICS,DYNAMICS","Bradley, Jonathan R.@Florida State Univ, Dept Stat, 117 N Woodward Ave, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA::Holan, Scott H.@Univ Missouri, Dept Stat, 146 Middlebush Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA@US Census Bur, 4600 Silver Hill Rd, Washington, DC 20233 USA::Wikle, Christopher K.@Univ Missouri, Dept Stat, 146 Middlebush Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Bradley, Jonathan R.@State University System of Florida@Florida State University::Holan, Scott H.@University of Missouri Columbia@University of Missouri System::Wikle, Christopher K.@University of Missouri Columbia@University of Missouri System",not exist,"no title+ABOWD JA+J PRIVACY CONFIDENTI+2013::no title+ABOWD JM+PRODUCER DYNAMICS NE+2009::no title+ANDERSON, T.

A Bayesian Nonparametric Approach to Testing for Dependence Between Random Variables,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA1027,DEC 2017,26,1,"Nonparametric and nonlinear measures of statistical dependence between pairs of random variables are important tools in modern data analysis. In particular the emergence of large data sets can now support the relaxation of linearity assumptions implicit in traditional association scores such as correlation. Here we describe a Bayesian nonparametric procedure that leads to a tractable, explicit and analytic quantification of the relative evidence for dependence vs independence. Our approach uses Polya tree priors on the space of probability measures which can then be embedded within a decision theoretic test for dependence. Polya tree priors can accommodate known uncertainty in the form of the underlying sampling distribution and provides an explicit posterior probability measure of both dependence and independence. Well known advantages of having an explicit probability measure include: easy comparison of evidence across different studies; encoding prior information; quantifying changes in dependence across different experimental conditions, and the integration of results within formal decision analysis.","dependence measure,Bayesian nonparametrics,Polya tree,hypothesis testing","POLYA TREE DISTRIBUTIONS,PROBABILITY-MEASURES,ASSOCIATIONS,INFERENCE,REVEALS","Filippi, Sarah@Univ Oxford, Dept Stat, Oxford, England::Holmes, Chris C.@Univ Oxford, Dept Stat, Oxford, England@Univ Oxford, Oxford Man Inst, Oxford, England","Filippi, Sarah@University of Oxford::Holmes, Chris C.@University of Oxford",not exist,"no title+Cover, T.

Joint Species Distribution Modeling: Dimension Reduction Using Dirichlet Processes,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA1031,DEC 2017,63,1,"Species distribution models are used to evaluate the variables that affect the distribution and abundance of species and to predict biodiversity. Historically, such models have been fitted to each species independently. While independent models can provide useful information regarding distribution and abundance, they ignore the fact that, after accounting for environmental covariates, residual interspecies dependence persists. With stacking of individual models, misleading behaviors, may arise. In particular, individual models often imply too many species per location.

Recently developed joint species distribution models have application to presence-absence, continuous or discrete abundance, abundance with large numbers of zeros, and discrete, ordinal, and compositional data. Here, we deal with the challenge of joint modeling for a large number of species. To appreciate the challenge in the simplest way, with just presence/absence (binary) response and say, S species, we have an S-way contingency table with 2 S cell probabilities. Even if S is as small as 100 this is an enormous table, infeasible to work with without some structure to reduce dimension.

We develop a computationally feasible approach to accommodate a large number of species ( say order 10 3) that allows us to: 1) assess the dependence structure across species; 2) identify clusters of species that have similar dependence patterns; and 3) jointly predict species distributions. To do so, we build hierarchical models capturing dependence between species at the first or ""data"" stage rather than at a second or ""mean"" stage. We employ the Dirichlet process for clustering in a novel way to reduce dimension in the joint covariance structure. This last step makes computation tractable.

We use Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA) data in the eastern region of the United States to demonstrate our method. It consists of presence-absence measurements for 112 tree species, observed east of the Mississippi. As a proof of concept for our dimension reduction approach, we also include simulations using continuous and binary data.","abundance,hierarchical model,latent variables,Markov chain Monte Carlo,presence-absence","PROCESS HIERARCHICAL-MODELS,CHAIN MONTE-CARLO,CLIMATE-CHANGE,PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS,PARAMETER EXPANSION,SAMPLING METHODS,ORDINAL DATA,BIODIVERSITY,REGRESSION,INFERENCE","Taylor-Rodriguez, Daniel@Duke Univ, SAMSI, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA::Kaufeld, Kimberly@North Carolina State Univ, SAMSI, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA::Schliep, Erin M.@Univ Missouri, Dept Stat, Columbia, MO 65211 USA::Clark, James S.@Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA::Gelfand, Alan E.@Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Taylor-Rodriguez, Daniel@Duke University::Kaufeld, Kimberly@Unknow::Schliep, Erin M.@University of Missouri Columbia@University of Missouri System::Clark, James S.@Duke University::Gelfand, Alan E.@Duke University","Taylor-Rodriguez, Daniel@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2959-0281","Bayesian Dynamic Factor Models and Port-folio Allocation.+Aguilar, O.; West, M.+Journal of Business &amp; Economic Statistics+2010::Application of a Bayesian nonparametric model to derive toxicity estimates based on the response of Antarctic microbial communities to fuel-contaminated soil+Arbel, Julyan; King, Catherine K.; Raymond, Ben; et al.+ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION+JUL 2015::Predictive power of principal components for single-index model and sufficient dimension reduction+Artemiou, Andreas; Li, Bing+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+AUG 2013::ON PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS AND REGRESSION: A STATISTICAL EXPLANATION OF A NATURAL PHENOMENON+Artemiou, Andreas; Li, Bing+STATISTICA SINICA+OCT 2009::Current approaches to modelling the environmental niche of eucalypts: Implication for management of forest biodiversity+Austin, MP; Meyers, JA+FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT+SEP 1996::The enhanced forest inventory and analysis program: national sampling design and estimation procedures+Bechtold, W.

Bayesian Variable Selection Regression of Multivariate Responses for Group Data,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/17-BA1081,DEC 2017,46,1,"We propose two multivariate extensions of the Bayesian group lasso for variable selection and estimation for data with high dimensional predictors and multi-dimensional response variables. The methods utilize spike and slab priors to yield solutions which are sparse at either a group level or both a group and individual feature level. The incorporation of group structure in a predictor matrix is a key factor in obtaining better estimators and identifying associations between multiple responses and predictors. The approach is suited to many biological studies where the response is multivariate and each predictor is embedded in some biological grouping structure such as gene pathways. Our Bayesian models are connected with penalized regression, and we prove both oracle and asymptotic distribution properties under an orthogonal design. We derive efficient Gibbs sampling algorithms for our models and provide the implementation in a comprehensive R package called MBSGS available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). The performance of the proposed approaches is compared to state-of-the-art variable selection strategies on simulated data sets. The proposed methodology is illustrated on a genetic dataset in order to identify markers grouping across chromosomes that explain the joint variability of gene expression in multiple tissues.","Bayesian variable selection,multivariate regression,sparsity,spike and slab","SPARSE-GROUP LASSO,LINEAR-MODELS,PENALIZED REGRESSION,MATRIX ESTIMATION,ASSOCIATION,INFORMATION,GENOMICS","Liquet, B.@Univ Pau & Pays Adour, CNRS, UMR 5142, Lab Mathemat & leurs Applicat, F-5142 Pau, France::Mengersen, K.@Queensland Univ Technol, ARC Ctr Excellence Math & Stat Frontiers, Brisbane, Qld, Australia@Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Math Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia::Pettitt, A.

"Inconsistency of Bayesian Inference for Misspecified Linear Models, and a Proposal for Repairing It",BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/17-BA1085,DEC 2017,47,0,"We empirically show that Bayesian inference can be inconsistent under misspecification in simple linear regression problems, both in a model averaging/selection and in a Bayesian ridge regression setting. We use the standard linear model, which assumes homoskedasticity, whereas the data are heteroskedastic (though, significantly, there are no outliers). As sample size increases, the posterior puts its mass on worse and worse models of ever higher dimension. This is caused by hypercompression, the phenomenon that the posterior puts its mass on distributions that have much larger KL divergence from the ground truth than their average, i.e. the Bayes predictive distribution. To remedy the problem, we equip the likelihood in Bayes' theorem with an exponent called the learning rate, and we propose the SafeBayesian method to learn the learning rate from the data. SafeBayes tends to select small learning rates, and regularizes more, as soon as hypercompression takes place. Its results on our data are quite encouraging.",,"COMPLEXITY DENSITY-ESTIMATION,POSTERIOR CONCENTRATION,INFORMATION,SELECTION,CLASSIFICATION,CONSISTENCY,LIKELIHOOD","Grunwald, Peter@CWI, Amsterdam, Netherlands@Leiden Univ, Leiden, Netherlands::van Ommen, Thijs@Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands","Grunwald, Peter@Leiden University::van Ommen, Thijs@University of Amsterdam",not exist,"no title+Audibert, J.

The Horseshoe plus Estimator of Ultra-Sparse Signals,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA1028,DEC 2017,45,3,"We propose a new prior for ultra-sparse signal detection that we term the ""horseshoe+ prior."" The horseshoe+ prior is a natural extension of the horseshoe prior that has achieved success in the estimation and detection of sparse signals and has been shown to possess a number of desirable theoretical properties while enjoying computational feasibility in high dimensions. The horseshoe+ prior builds upon these advantages. Our work proves that the horseshoe+ posterior concentrates at a rate faster than that of the horseshoe in the Kullback-Leibler (K-L) sense. We also establish theoretically that the proposed estimator has lower posterior mean squared error in estimating signals compared to the horseshoe and achieves the optimal Bayes risk in testing up to a constant. For one-group global-local scale mixture priors, we develop a new technique for analyzing the marginal sparse prior densities using the class of Meijer-G functions. In simulations, the horseshoe+ estimator demonstrates superior performance in a standard design setting against competing methods, including the horseshoe and Dirichlet-Laplace estimators. We conclude with an illustration on a prostate cancer data set and by pointing out some directions for future research.","Bayesian,global-local shrinkage,horseshoe,horseshoe,normal means,sparsity","EMPIRICAL-BAYES,POSTERIOR CONCENTRATION,ASYMPTOTIC PROPERTIES,PRIOR DISTRIBUTIONS,VARIABLE-SELECTION,SHRINKAGE,REGRESSION,ASSOCIATION,PARAMETER,SEQUENCES","Bhadra, Anindya@Purdue Univ, Dept Stat, 250 N Univ St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA::Datta, Jyotishka@Univ Arkansas, Dept Math Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA::Polson, Nicholas G.@Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, 5807 S Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA::Willard, Brandon@Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, 5807 S Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Bhadra, Anindya@Purdue University@Purdue University System::Datta, Jyotishka@University of Arkansas Fayetteville@University of Arkansas System::Polson, Nicholas G.@University of Chicago::Willard, Brandon@University of Chicago","Datta, Jyotishka@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5991-5182","Generalized Beta Mixtures of Gaussians.+Armagan, Artin; Dunson, David B; Clyde, Merlise+Advances in neural information processing systems+2011::GENERALIZED DOUBLE PARETO SHRINKAGE+Armagan, Artin; Dunson, David B.; Lee, Jaeyong+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 2013::NORMAL VARIANCE MEAN MIXTURES AND Z-DISTRIBUTIONS+BARNDORFFNIELSEN, O; KENT, J; SORENSEN, M+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+1982::The horseshoe+ estimator of ultra-sparse signals+Bhadra, A.; Datta, J.; Polson, N.

Asymptotic Optimality of One-Group Shrinkage Priors in Sparse High-dimensional Problems,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA1029,DEC 2017,22,1,"We study asymptotic optimality of inference in a high-dimensional sparse normal means model using a broad class of one-group shrinkage priors. Assuming that the proportion of non-zero means is known, we show that the corresponding Bayes estimates asymptotically attain the minimax risk (up to a multiplicative constant) for estimation with squared error loss. The constant is shown to be 1 for the important sub-class of ""horseshoe-type"" priors proving exact asymptotic minimaxity property for these priors, a result hitherto unknown in the literature. An empirical Bayes version of the estimator is shown to achieve the minimax rate in case the level of sparsity is unknown. We prove that the resulting posterior distributions contract around the true mean vector at the minimax optimal rate and provide important insight about the possible rate of posterior contraction around the corresponding Bayes estimator. Our work shows that for rate optimality, a heavy tailed prior with sufficient mass around zero is enough, a pole at zero like the horseshoe prior is not necessary. This part of the work is inspired by van der Pas et al. (2014). We come up with novel unifying arguments to extend their results over the general class of priors. Next we focus on simultaneous hypothesis testing for the means under the additive 0-1 loss where the means are modeled through a two-groups mixture distribution. We study asymptotic risk properties of certain multiple testing procedures induced by the class of one-group priors under study, when applied in this set-up. Our key results show that the tests based on the ""horseshoe-type"" priors asymptotically achieve the risk of the optimal solution in this two-groups framework up to the correct constant and are thus asymptotically Bayes optimal under sparsity (ABOS). This is the first result showing that in a sparse problem a class of one-group priors can exactly mimic the performance of an optimal two-groups solution asymptotically. Our work shows an intrinsic technical connection between the theories of minimax estimation and simultaneous hypothesis testing for such one-group priors.","asymptotic minimaxity,posterior contraction,ABOS,sparsity,one-group shrinkage priors,horseshoe prior","POSTERIOR CONCENTRATION,HORSESHOE ESTIMATOR","Ghosh, Prasenjit@Indian Stat Inst, Appl Stat Unit, 203 Barrackpore Trunk Rd, Kolkata 700108, India::Chakrabarti, Arijit@Indian Stat Inst, Appl Stat Unit, 203 Barrackpore Trunk Rd, Kolkata 700108, India","Ghosh, Prasenjit@Indian Statistical Institute@Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata::Chakrabarti, Arijit@Indian Statistical Institute@Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata",not exist,"Generalized Beta Mixtures of Gaussians.+Armagan, Artin; Dunson, David B; Clyde, Merlise+Advances in neural information processing systems+2011::GENERALIZED DOUBLE PARETO SHRINKAGE+Armagan, Artin; Dunson, David B.; Lee, Jaeyong+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 2013::The Horseshoe+ Estimator of Ultra-Sparse Signals+Bhadra, A.; Datta, J.; Polson, N.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Willard, B</span>.+arXiv: 1502.00560v2. 1143+2015::Bayesian Shrinkage+Bhattacharya, A.; Pati, D.; Pillai, N.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Dunson, D.

Bayesian Analysis of the Stationary MAP(2),BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA1026,DEC 2017,47,0,"In this article we describe a method for carrying out Bayesian estimation for the two-state stationary Markov arrival process (MAP(2)), which has been proposed as a versatile model in a number of contexts. The approach is illustrated on both simulated and real data sets, where the performance of the MAP(2) is compared against that of the well-known MMPP2. As an extension of the method, we estimate the queue length and virtual waiting time distributions of a stationary MAP(2)/G/1 queueing system, a matrix generalization of the M/G/1 queue that allows for dependent inter-arrival times. Our procedure is illustrated with applications in Internet traffic analysis.","phase-type distributions,Markov modulated Poisson process (MMPP),Identifiability,canonical representation,Gibbs sampler,steady-state distributions","MARKOVIAN ARRIVAL PROCESS,INTERARRIVAL TIMES,QUEUING SYSTEM,MODEL,IDENTIFIABILITY,STREAMS","Ramirez-Cobo, P.@Univ Cadiz, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Cadiz, Spain::Lillo, R.

Marginal Pseudo-Likelihood Learning of Discrete Markov Network Structures,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA1032,DEC 2017,38,3,"Markov networks are a popular tool for modeling multivariate distributions over a set of discrete variables. The core of the Markov network representation is an undirected graph which elegantly captures the dependence structure over the variables. Traditionally, the Bayesian approach of learning the graph structure from data has been done under the assumption of chordality since non-chordal graphs are difficult to evaluate for likelihood-based scores. Recently, there has been a surge of interest towards the use of regularized pseudo-likelihood methods as such approaches can avoid the assumption of chordality. Many of the currently available methods necessitate the use of a tuning parameter to adapt the level of regularization for a particular dataset. Here we introduce the marginal pseudo-likelihood which has a built-in regularization through marginalization over the graph-specific nuisance parameters. We prove consistency of the resulting graph estimator via comparison with the pseudo-Bayesian information criterion. To identify high-scoring graph structures in a high-dimensional setting we design a two-step algorithm that exploits the decomposable structure of the score. Using synthetic and existing benchmark networks, the marginal pseudo-likelihood method is shown to perform favorably against recent popular structure learning methods.","Markov networks,structure learning,pseudo-likelihood,non-chordal graph,Bayesian inference,regularization","CONTEXT-SPECIFIC INDEPENDENCE,ISING-MODEL SELECTION,RANDOM-FIELDS,BAYESIAN NETWORKS,GRAPHICAL MODELS,TREES","Pensar, Johan@Abo Akad Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Turku, Finland::Nyman, Henrik@Abo Akad Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Turku, Finland::Niiranen, Juha@Univ Helsinki, Dept Math & Stat, Helsinki, Finland::Corander, Jukka@Univ Helsinki, Dept Math & Stat, Helsinki, Finland@Univ Oslo, Dept Biostat, Oslo, Norway","Pensar, Johan@Abo Akademi University::Nyman, Henrik@Abo Akademi University::Niiranen, Juha@University of Helsinki::Corander, Jukka@University of Oslo@University of Helsinki",not exist,"Some variations on the PC algorithm+Abellan, J.; Gomez-Olmedo, M.; Moral, S.+P 3 EUR WORKSH PROB+2006::NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::HIGH-DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURE ESTIMATION IN ISING MODELS: LOCAL SEPARATION CRITERION+Anandkumar, Animashree; Tan, Vincent Y.

Uncertainty Quantification for the Horseshoe (with Discussion),BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/17-BA1065,DEC 2017,53,1,We investigate the credible sets and marginal credible intervals resulting from the horseshoe prior in the sparse multivariate normal means model. We do so in an adaptive setting without assuming knowledge of the sparsity level (number of signals). We consider both the hierarchical Bayes method of putting a prior on the unknown sparsity level and the empirical Bayes method with the sparsity level estimated by maximum marginal likelihood. We show that credible balls and marginal credible intervals have good frequentist coverage and optimal size if the sparsity level of the prior is set correctly. By general theory honest confidence sets cannot adapt in size to an unknown sparsity level. Accordingly the hierarchical and empirical Bayes credible sets based on the horseshoe prior are not honest over the full parameter space. We show that this is due to over-shrinkage for certain parameters and characterise the set of parameters for which credible balls and marginal credible intervals do give correct uncertainty quantification. In particular we show that the fraction of false discoveries by the marginal Bayesian procedure is controlled by a correct choice of cut-off.,"credible sets,horseshoe,sparsity,nearly black vectors,normal means problem,frequentist Bayes","BAYESIAN CREDIBLE SETS,SELF-SIMILAR FUNCTIONS,POSTERIOR CONCENTRATION,ASYMPTOTIC PROPERTIES,CONFIDENCE-REGIONS,LINEAR-REGRESSION,SPARSE SEQUENCES,ESTIMATOR,SHRINKAGE,MODELS","van der Pas, Stephanie@Leiden Univ, Leiden, Netherlands::Szabo, Botond@Leiden Univ, Leiden, Netherlands@Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Budapest, Hungary::van der Vaart, Aad@Leiden Univ, Leiden, Netherlands","van der Pas, Stephanie@Leiden University::Szabo, Botond@Budapest University of Technology & Economics@Leiden University::van der Vaart, Aad@Leiden University","van der vaart, aad@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8074-2375::van der Pas, Stephanie@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2448-5378","GENERALIZED DOUBLE PARETO SHRINKAGE+Armagan, Artin; Dunson, David B.; Lee, Jaeyong+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 2013::no title+Belitser, E.; Nurushev, N.+Needles and straw in a haystack: empirical Bayes confidence for possibly sparse sequences+2015::ON COVERAGE AND LOCAL RADIAL RATES OF CREDIBLE SETS+Belitser, Eduard+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2017::no title+Bhadra, A.; Datta, J.; Polson, N.

Deep Learning: A Bayesian Perspective,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/17-BA1082,DEC 2017,89,0,"Deep learning is a form of machine learning for nonlinear high dimensional pattern matching and prediction. By taking a Bayesian probabilistic perspective, we provide a number of insights into more efficient algorithms for optimisation and hyper-parameter tuning. Traditional high-dimensional data reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares (PLS), reduced rank regression (RRR), projection pursuit regression (PPR) are all shown to be shallow learners. Their deep learning counterparts exploit multiple deep layers of data reduction which provide predictive performance gains. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training optimisation and Dropout (DO) regularization provide estimation and variable selection. Bayesian regularization is central to finding weights and connections in networks to optimize the predictive bias-variance trade-off. To illustrate our methodology, we provide an analysis of international bookings on Airbnb. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.","deep learning,machine learning,Artificial Intelligence,LSTM models,prediction,Bayesian hierarchical models,pattern matching,TensorFlow","NEURAL-NETWORKS,DIMENSION REDUCTION,BELIEF NETWORKS,REGRESSION,MODELS,CLASSIFICATION,CHEMOMETRICS,TREES","Polson, Nicholas G.@Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA::Sokolov, Vadim@George Mason Univ, Volgenau Sch Engn, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA","Polson, Nicholas G.@University of Chicago::Sokolov, Vadim@George Mason University",not exist,"A LEARNING ALGORITHM FOR BOLTZMANN MACHINES+ACKLEY, DH; HINTON, GE; SEJNOWSKI, TJ+COGNITIVE SCIENCE+1985::Concomitant Extrahepatic Disease in Patients With Colorectal Liver Metastases When Is There a Place for Surgery?+Adam, Rene; de Haas, Robbert J.; Wicherts, Dennis A.; et al.+ANNALS OF SURGERY+FEB 2011::no title+Amit, Y.; Blanchard, G.; Wilder, K.+Multiple randomized classifiers: MRCL+2000::Shape quantization and recognition with randomized trees+Amit, Y; Geman, D+NEURAL COMPUTATION+OCT 1 1997::Deep speech 2: end-to-end speech recognition in English and mandarin+Amodei, D.; Anubhai, R.; Battenberg, E.+INT C MACH LEARN+2016::Stationary process approximation for the analysis of large spatial datasets+Banerjee, Sudipto; Gelfand, Alan E.; Finley, Andrew O.; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2008::Ensemble learning in Bayesian neural networks+Barber, D.; Bishop, C.M.+Neural Networks and Machine Learning.

Bayesian Mixture Models with Focused Clustering for Mixed Ordinal and Nominal Data,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA1020,SEP 2017,47,2,"In some contexts, mixture models can fit certain variables well at the expense of others in ways beyond the analyst's control. For example, when the data include some variables with non-trivial amounts of missing values, the mixture model may fit the marginal distributions of the nearly and fully complete variables at the expense of the variables with high fractions of missing data. Motivated by this setting, we present a mixture model for mixed ordinal and nominal data that splits variables into two groups, focus variables and remainder variables. The model allows the analyst to specify a rich sub-model for the focus variables and a simpler sub-model for remainder variables, yet still capture associations among the variables. Using simulations, we illustrate advantages and limitations of focused clustering compared to mixture models that do not distinguish variables. We apply the model to handle missing values in an analysis of the 2012 American National Election Study, estimating relationships among voting behavior, ideology, and political party affiliation.","categorical,missing,mixture model,multiple imputation","MULTIPLE IMPUTATION,CATEGORICAL-DATA,COMPLETED-DATA,REGRESSION,BINARY","DeYoreo, Maria@Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA@Duke Univ, Durham, NC USA::Reiter, Jerome P.@Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA@Duke Univ, Stat Sci, Durham, NC USA::Hillygus, D.

A Decision-Theoretic Comparison of Treatments to Resolve Air Leaks After Lung Surgery Based on Nonparametric Modeling,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA1016,SEP 2017,24,2,"We propose a Bayesian nonparametric utility-based group sequential design for a randomized clinical trial to compare a gel sealant to standard care for resolving air leaks after pulmonary resection. Clinically, resolving air leaks in the days soon after surgery is highly important, since longer resolution time produces undesirable complications that require extended hospitalization. The problem of comparing treatments is complicated by the fact that the resolution time distributions are skewed and multi-modal, so using means is misleading. We address these challenges by assuming Bayesian nonparametric probability models for the resolution time distributions and basing the comparative test on weighted means. The weights are elicited as clinical utilities of the resolution times. The proposed design uses posterior expected utilities as group sequential test criteria. The procedure's frequentist properties are studied by extensive simulations.","Bayesian nonparametric,clinical trial,mesothelioma,utility function","PULMONARY RESECTION,SEALANT,UTILITY","Xu, Yanxun@Univ Texas Austin, Dept Stat & Data Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA@Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Appl Math & Stat, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA::Thall, Peter F.@Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Biostat, Houston, TX 77030 USA::Mueller, Peter@Univ Texas Austin, Dept Math, Austin, TX 78712 USA::Reza, Mehran J.@Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Thorac Surg, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Xu, Yanxun@University of Texas Austin@Johns Hopkins University@University of Texas System::Thall, Peter F.@UTMD Anderson Cancer Center@University of Texas System::Mueller, Peter@University of Texas Austin@University of Texas System::Reza, Mehran J.@UTMD Anderson Cancer Center@University of Texas System",not exist,"Prospective randomized study evaluating a biodegradable polymeric sealant for sealing intraoperative air leaks that occur during pulmonary resection+Allen, MS; Wood, DE; Hawkinson, RW; et al.+ANNALS OF THORACIC SURGERY+MAY 2004::On the Support of MacEachern's Dependent Dirichlet Processes and Extensions+Barrientos, Andres F.; Jara, Alejandro; Quintana, Fernando A.+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2012::no title+Bellman, R.

The Scaled Beta2 Distribution as a Robust Prior for Scales,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA1015,SEP 2017,26,0,"We put forward the Scaled Beta2 (SBeta2) as a flexible and tractable family for modeling scales in both hierarchical and non-hierarchical settings. Various sensible alternatives to the overuse of vague Inverted Gamma priors have been proposed, mainly for hierarchical models. Several of these alternatives are particular cases of the SBeta2 or can be well approximated by it. This family of distributions can be obtained in closed form as a Gamma scale mixture of Gamma distributions, as the Student distribution can be obtained as a Gamma scale mixture of Normal variables. Members of the SBeta2 family arise as intrinsic priors and as divergence based priors in diverse situations, hierarchical and non-hierarchical.

The SBeta2 family unifies and generalizes different proposals in the Bayesian literature, and has numerous theoretical and practical advantages: it is flexible, its members can be lighter, as heavy or heavier tailed as the half-Cauchy, and different behaviors at the origin can be modeled. It has the reciprocality property, i.e if the variance parameter is in the family the precision also is. It is easy to simulate from, and can be embedded in a Gibbs sampling scheme. Short of not being conjugate, it is also amazingly tractable: when coupled with a conditional Cauchy prior for locations, the marginal prior for locations can be found explicitly as proportional to known transcendental functions, and for integer values of the hyperparameters an analytical closed form exists. Furthermore, for specific choices of the hyperparameters, the marginal is found to be an explicit ""horseshoe prior"", which are known to have excellent theoretical and practical properties. To our knowledge this is the first closed form horseshoe prior obtained. We also show that for certain values of the hyperparameters the mixture of a Normal and a Scaled Beta2 distribution also gives a closed form marginal.

Examples include robust normal and binomial hierarchical modeling and metaanalysis, with real and simulated data.","Scaled Beta2 distribution,prior for scale parameters,horseshoe prior,intrinsic priors,divergence priors,reciprocality","BAYES FACTORS,INFERENCE,SELECTION,MODELS,GAMMA","Perez, Maria-Eglee@Univ Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras Campus, San Juan, PR 00931 USA::Raul Pericchi, Luis@Univ Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras Campus, San Juan, PR 00931 USA::Cristina Ramirez, Isabel@Univ Nacl Colombia Sede Medellin, Medellin, Antioquia, Colombia","Perez, Maria-Eglee@University of Puerto Rico Rio Piedras@University of Puerto Rico::Raul Pericchi, Luis@University of Puerto Rico Rio Piedras@University of Puerto Rico::Cristina Ramirez, Isabel@Universidad Nacional de Colombia","Perez Hernandez, Maria-Eglee@W-3868-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8641-8405","Bayesian Robustness Modeling Using Regularly Varying Distributions+Andrade, J.

Nonparametric Goodness of Fit via Cross-Validation Bayes Factors,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA1018,SEP 2017,21,0,"A nonparametric Bayes procedure is proposed for testing the fit of a parametric model for a distribution. Alternatives to the parametric model are kernel density estimates. Data splitting makes it possible to use kernel estimates for this purpose in a Bayesian setting. A kernel estimate indexed by bandwidth is computed from one part of the data, a training set, and then used as a model for the rest of the data, a validation set. A Bayes factor is calculated from the validation set by comparing the marginal for the kernel model with the marginal for the parametric model of interest. A simulation study is used to investigate how large the training set should be, and examples involving astronomy and wind data are provided. A proof of Bayes consistency of the proposed test is also provided.","bandwidth selection,Bayes factor,consistency,cross validation,goodness-of-fit tests,kernel density estimates","PLANETARY-NEBULAE,STANDARD CANDLES,DISTRIBUTIONS,MODEL","Hart, Jeffrey D.@Texas A&M Univ, Dept Stat, College Stn, TX 77843 USA::Choi, Taeryon@Korea Univ, Dept Stat, Seoul, South Korea","Hart, Jeffrey D.@Texas A&M University System@Texas A&M University College Station::Choi, Taeryon@Korea University",not exist,"NONPARAMETRIC ESTIMATION OF ENTROPY FOR ABSOLUTELY CONTINUOUS DISTRIBUTIONS+AHMAD, IA; LIN, PE+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY+1976::On cross-validation of Bayesian models+Alqallaf, F; Gustafson, P+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+JUN 2001::Bayesian and conditional frequentist testing of a parametric model versus nonparametric alternatives+Berger, JO; Guglielmi, A+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2001::The intrinsic Bayes factor for model selection and prediction+Berger, JO; Pericchi, LR+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1996::SOME GLOBAL MEASURES OF DEVIATIONS OF DENSITY-FUNCTION ESTIMATES+BICKEL, PJ; ROSENBLA.M+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1973::Planetary nebulae as standard candles.

A Generalised Semiparametric Bayesian Fay-Herriot Model for Small Area Estimation Shrinking Both Means and Variances,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA1019,SEP 2017,42,0,"In survey sampling, interest often lies in unplanned domains (or small areas), whose sample sizes may be too small to allow for accurate design-based inference. To improve the direct estimates by borrowing strength from similar domains, most small area methods rely on mixed effects regression models.

This contribution extends the well known Fay-Herriot model (Fay and Herriot, 1979) within a Bayesian approach in two directions. First, the default normality assumption for the random effects is replaced by a nonparametric specification using a Dirichlet process. Second, uncertainty on variances is explicitly introduced, recognizing the fact that they are actually estimated from survey data. The proposed approach shrinks variances as well as means, and accounts for all sources of uncertainty. Adopting a flexible model for the random effects allows to accommodate outliers and vary the borrowing of strength by identifying local neighbourhoods where the exchangeability assumption holds. Through application to real and simulated data, we investigate the performance of the proposed model in predicting the domain means under different distributional assumptions. We also focus on the construction of credible intervals for the area means, a topic that has received less attention in the literature. Frequentist properties such as mean squared prediction error (MSPE), coverage and interval length are investigated. The experiments performed seem to indicate that inferences under the proposed model are characterised by smaller mean squared error than competing approaches; frequentist coverage of the credible intervals is close to nominal.","Dirichlet process prior,Fay-Herriot,Hierarchical models,mixed effects regression models,small area,smoothing of sampling variances","NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS,HIERARCHICAL BAYES,SQUARED ERROR,PREDICTORS,DISTRIBUTIONS","Polettini, Silvia@Sapienza Univ Roma, Dipartimento MEMOTEF, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy","Polettini, Silvia@Sapienza University Rome",not exist,"MIXTURES OF DIRICHLET PROCESSES WITH APPLICATIONS TO BAYESIAN NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS+ANTONIAK, CE+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1974::On the superiority of the Bayesian method over the BLUP in small area estimation problems+Arora, V; Lahiri, P+STATISTICA SINICA+OCT 1997::A Finite Mixture Fay Herriot-type model for estimating regional rental prices in Germany+Articus, C.; Burgard, J.

"Selection of Tuning Parameters, Solution Paths and Standard Errors for Bayesian Lassos",BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA1025,SEP 2017,39,1,"Penalized regression methods such as the lasso and elastic net (EN) have become popular for simultaneous variable selection and coefficient estimation. Implementation of these methods require selection of the penalty parameters. We propose an empirical Bayes (EB) methodology for selecting these tuning parameters as well as computation of the regularization path plots. The EB method does not suffer from the ""double shrinkage problem"" of frequentist EN. Also it avoids the difficulty of constructing an appropriate prior on the penalty parameters. The EB methodology is implemented by efficient importance sampling method based on multiple Gibbs sampler chains. Since the Markov chains underlying the Gibbs sampler are proved to be geometrically ergodic, Markov chain central limit theorem can be used to provide asymptotically valid confidence band for profiles of EN coefficients. The practical effectiveness of our method is illustrated by several simulation examples and two real life case studies. Although this article considers lasso and EN for brevity, the proposed EB method is general and can be used to select shrinkage parameters in other regularization methods.","Bayesian lasso,elastic net,empirical Bayes,geometric ergodicity,importance sampling,Markov chain Monte Carlo,shrinkage,standard errors","CHAIN MONTE-CARLO,VARIABLE SELECTION,REGRESSION SHRINKAGE,CONVERGENCE-RATES,ORACLE PROPERTIES,MODEL SELECTION,ELASTIC NET,ESTIMATORS,REGULARIZATION,DISTRIBUTIONS","Roy, Vivekananda@Iowa State Univ, Dept Stat, Ames, IA 50011 USA::Chakraborty, Sounak@Univ Missouri, Dept Stat, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Roy, Vivekananda@Iowa State University::Chakraborty, Sounak@University of Missouri Columbia@University of Missouri System",not exist,"SCALE MIXTURES OF NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS+ANDREWS, DF; MALLOWS, CL+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1974::A new proof of convergence of MCMC via the ergodic theorem+Asmussen, Soren; Glynn, Peter W.+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+OCT 2011::Simultaneous regression shrinkage, variable selection, and supervised clustering of predictors with OSCAR+Bondell, Howard D.; Reich, Brian J.+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2008::COMPUTATIONAL APPROACHES FOR EMPIRICAL BAYES METHODS AND BAYESIAN SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS+Buta, Eugenia; Doss, Hani+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+OCT 2011::The horseshoe estimator for sparse signals+Carvalho, Carlos M.; Polson, Nicholas G.; Scott, James G.+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 2010::ESTIMATION OF LARGE FAMILIES OF BAYES FACTORS FROM MARKOV CHAIN OUTPUT+Doss, Hani+STATISTICA SINICA+APR 2010::Least angle regression+Efron, B; Hastie, T; Johnstone, I; et al.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2004::Variable selection via nonconcave penalized likelihood and its oracle properties+Fan, JQ; Li, RZ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2001::BATCH MEANS AND SPECTRAL VARIANCE ESTIMATORS IN MARKOV CHAIN MONTE CARLO+Flegal, James M.; Jones, Galin L.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2010::Estimating normalizing constants and reweighting mixtures in Markov chain Monte Carlo+Geyer, C.

Adaptive Shrinkage in Polya Tree Type Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA1021,SEP 2017,31,0,"We introduce a hierarchical generalization to the Polya tree that incorporates locally adaptive shrinkage to data features of different scales, while maintaining analytical simplicity and computational efficiency. Inference under the new model proceeds efficiently using general recipes for conjugate hierarchical models, and can be completed extremely efficiently for data sets with large numbers of observations. We illustrate in density estimation that the achieved adaptive shrinkage results in proper smoothing and substantially improves inference. We evaluate the performance of the model through simulation under several schematic scenarios carefully designed to be representative of a variety of applications. We compare its performance to that of the Polya tree, the optional Polya tree, and the Dirichlet process mixture. We then apply our method to a flow cytometry data with 455,472 observations to achieve fast estimation of a large number of univariate and multivariate densities, and investigate the computational properties of our method in that context. In addition, we establish theoretical guarantees for the model including absolute continuity, full nonparametricity, and posterior consistency.

A Bayes Interpretation of Stacking for M-Complete and M-Open Settings,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA1023,SEP 2017,23,0,"In M-open problems where no true model can be conceptualized, it is common to back off from modeling and merely seek good prediction. Even in M-complete problems, taking a predictive approach can be very useful. Stacking is a model averaging procedure that gives a composite predictor by combining individual predictors from a list of models using weights that optimize a cross-validation criterion. We show that the stacking weights also asymptotically minimize a posterior expected loss. Hence we formally provide a Bayesian justification for cross-validation. Often the weights are constrained to be positive and sum to one. For greater generality, we omit the positivity constraint and relax the 'sum to one' constraint.

A key question is 'What predictors should be in the average?' We first verify that the stacking error depends only on the span of the models. Then we propose using bootstrap samples from the data to generate empirical basis elements that can be used to form models. We use this in two computed examples to give stacking predictors that are (i) data driven, (ii) optimal with respect to the number of component predictors, and (iii) optimal with respect to the weight each predictor gets.","stacking,cross-validation,Bayes action,prediction,problem classes,optimization constrains",,"Le, Tri@Univ Nebraska, Dept Stat, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA::Clarke, Bertrand@Univ Nebraska, Dept Stat, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA","Le, Tri@University of Nebraska Lincoln@University of Nebraska System::Clarke, Bertrand@University of Nebraska Lincoln@University of Nebraska System",not exist,"no title+Bernardo, J.; Smith, A.+Bayesian Theory+2000::Stacked regressions+Breiman, L+MACHINE LEARNING+JUL 1996::Bayes model averaging and stacking when model approximation error cannot be ignored+Clarke, B.+J. of Machine Learning Research+2003::Bayesian model averaging in the M-open frame-work+Clyde, M.; Iversen, E.+Bayesian Theory and Applications+2013::Bayesian perspectives on combining models+Clyde, M.+Slides from presentation at ISBA Kyoto+2012::Combined analysis of soil moisture measurements from roving and fixed cosmic ray neutron probes for multiscale real-time monitoring+Franz, Trenton E.; Wang, Tiejun; Avery, William; et al.+GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS+MAY 16 2015::Supplementary Appendices of  A Bayes interpretation of stacking for M-complete and M-open settings+Le, T.; Clarke, B.+Bayesian Analysis+2016::Using the Bayesian Shtarkov solution for predictions+Le, Tri; Clarke, Bertrand+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+DEC 2016::no title+Minka, T.

Latent Class Mixture Models of Treatment Effect Heterogeneity,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA1022,SEP 2017,28,2,"We provide a general Bayesian framework for modeling treatment effect heterogeneity in experiments with non-categorical outcomes. Our modeling approach incorporates latent class mixture components to capture discrete heterogeneity and regression interaction terms to capture continuous heterogeneity. Flexible error distributions allow robust posterior inference on parameters of interest. Hierarchical shrinkage priors on relevant parameters address multiple comparisons concerns. Leave-one-out cross validation estimates of expected posterior predictive density obtained through importance sampling, together with posterior predictive checks, provide a convenient method for model selection and evaluation. We apply our approach to a clinical trial comparing two HIV treatments and to an instrumental variable analysis of a natural experiment on the effect of Medicaid enrollment on emergency department utilization.","treatment effect heterogeneity,subgroup analysis,causal inference,latent class mixture model","INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT RULES,SUBGROUP ANALYSIS,IDENTIFICATION","Shahn, Zach@Harvard Sch Publ Hlth, Boston, MA 02115 USA::Madigan, David@Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA","Shahn, Zach@Harvard University::Madigan, David@Columbia University",not exist,"Identification of causal effects using instrumental variables+Angrist, JD; Imbens, GW; Rubin, DB+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1996::Machine Learning Methods for Estimating Heterogeneous Causal 'Effects'.+Athey, Susan; Imbens, Guido.+ArXiv Preprint ArXiv: 1504.01132.+2015::Accept-reject Metropolis-Hastings sampling and marginal likelihood estimation+Chib, S; Jeliazkov, I+STATISTICA NEERLANDICA+FEB 2005::Analysis of treatment response data without the joint distribution of potential outcomes+Chib, Siddhartha+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+OCT 2007::Theory and applications of proper scoring rules+Dawid, Alexander Philip; Musio, Monica+METRON-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+AUG 2014::Subgroup identification from randomized clinical trial data+Foster, Jared C.; Taylor, Jeremy M.

Intrinsic Bayesian Analysis for Occupancy Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA1014,SEP 2017,35,0,"Occupancy models are typically used to determine the probability of a species being present at a given site while accounting for imperfect detection. The survey data underlying these models often include information on several predictors that could potentially characterize habitat suitability and species detectability. Because these variables might not all be relevant, model selection techniques are necessary in this context. In practice, model selection is performed using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), as few other alternatives are available. This paper builds an objective Bayesian variable selection framework for occupancy models through the intrinsic prior methodology. The procedure incorporates priors on the model space that account for test multiplicity and respect the polynomial hierarchy of the predictors when higher-order terms are considered. The methodology is implemented using a stochastic search algorithm that is able to thoroughly explore large spaces of occupancy models. The proposed strategy is entirely automatic and provides control of false positives without sacrificing the discovery of truly meaningful covariates. The performance of the method is evaluated and compared to AIC through a simulation study. The method is illustrated on two datasets previously studied in the literature.","imperfect detection,intrinsic priors,model priors,strong heredity,Bayesian variable selection,AIC","POLYNOMIAL REGRESSION-MODELS,VARIABLE SELECTION,MARGINAL LIKELIHOOD,DISTRIBUTIONS,OUTPUT","Taylor-Rodriguez, Daniel@Duke Univ, SAMSI, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA::Womack, Andrew J.@Indiana Univ, Dept Stat, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA::Fuentes, Claudio@Oregon State Univ, Dept Stat, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA::Bliznyuk, Nikolay@Univ Florida, Dept Agr, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA@Univ Florida, Dept Biol Engn, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA@Univ Florida, Dept Biostat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Taylor-Rodriguez, Daniel@Duke University::Womack, Andrew J.@Indiana University Bloomington@Indiana University System::Fuentes, Claudio@Oregon State University@Oregon University System::Bliznyuk, Nikolay@State University System of Florida@University of Florida","Taylor-Rodriguez, Daniel@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2959-0281","Information measures and model selection+Akaike, A.+Int Stat Inst+1983::BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS OF BINARY AND POLYCHOTOMOUS RESPONSE DATA+ALBERT, JH; CHIB, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1993::The intrinsic Bayes factor for model selection and prediction+Berger, JO; Pericchi, LR+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1996::no title+Burnham, K.; Anderson, D.+Model Selection and Multimodel Inference: A Practical Information-Theoretic Approach+2003::Multimodel inference - understanding AIC and BIC in model selection+Burnham, KP; Anderson, DR+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS &amp; RESEARCH+NOV 2004::Objective Bayesian variable selection+Casella, G; Moreno, E+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2006::Marginal likelihood from the Metropolis-Hastings output+Chib, S; Jeliazkov, I+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2001::Marginal likelihood from the Gibbs output+Chib, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1995::Bayesian variable selection with related predictors+Chipman, H+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+MAR 1996::A Gibbs sampler for Bayesian analysis of site-occupancy data+Dorazio, Robert M.; Rodriguez, Daniel Taylor+METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION+DEC 2012::unmarked: An R package for fitting hierarchical models of wildlife occurrence and abundance+Fiske, I.; Chandler, R.+Journal of Statistical Software+2011::Relative fixed-width stopping rules for Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations.+Flegal, J.

High-Dimensional Bayesian Geostatistics,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/17-BA1056R,JUN 2017,91,0,"With the growing capabilities of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and user-friendly software, statisticians today routinely encounter geographically referenced data containing observations from a large number of spatial locations and time points. Over the last decade, hierarchical spatiotemporal process models have become widely deployed statistical tools for researchers to better understand the complex nature of spatial and temporal variability. However, fitting hierarchical spatiotemporal models often involves expensive matrix computations with complexity increasing in cubic order for the number of spatial locations and temporal points. This renders such models unfeasible for large data sets. This article offers a focused review of two methods for constructing well-defined highly scalable spatiotemporal stochastic processes. Both these processes can be used as ""priors"" for spatiotemporal random fields. The first approach constructs a lowrank process operating on a lower-dimensional subspace. The second approach constructs a Nearest-Neighbor Gaussian Process (NNGP) that ensures sparse precision matrices for its finite realizations. Both processes can be exploited as a scalable prior embedded within a rich hierarchical modeling framework to deliver full Bayesian inference. These approaches can be described as model-based solutions for big spatiotemporal datasets. The models ensure that the algorithmic complexity has similar to n floating point operations (flops), where n the number of spatial locations (per iteration). We compare these methods and provide some insight into their methodological underpinnings.","Bayesian statistics,Gaussian process,low rank Gaussian process,Nearest Neighbor Gaussian process (NNGP),predictive process,sparse Gaussian process,spatiotemporal statistics","GAUSSIAN PROCESS MODELS,SPATIAL DATA SETS,SPATIOTEMPORAL DATA,LINEAR-MODEL,LIKELIHOOD,DATASETS,COREGIONALIZATION,PREDICTION,FIELDS","Banerjee, Sudipto@UCLA Dept Biostat, 650 Charles E Young Dr South, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Banerjee, Sudipto@Unknow",not exist,"no title+Anderson, T.

Bayesian Estimation of Principal Components for Functional Data,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA1003,JUN 2017,19,1,"The area of principal components analysis (PCA) has seen relatively few contributions from the Bayesian school of inference. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian method for PCA in the case of functional data observed with error. We suggest modeling the covariance function by use of an approximate spectral decomposition, leading to easily interpretable parameters. We perform model selection, both over the number of principal components and the number of basis functions used in the approximation. We study in depth the choice of using the implied distributions arising from the inverse Wishart prior and prove a convergence theorem for the case of an exact finite dimensional representation. We also discuss computational issues as well as the care needed in choosing hyperparameters. A simulation study is used to demonstrate competitive performance against a recent frequentist procedure, particularly in terms of the principal component estimation. Finally, we apply the method to a real dataset, where we also incorporate model selection on the dimension of the finite basis used for modeling.","principal components,covariance estimation,functional data",MODELS,"Suarez, Adam J.@North Carolina State Univ, Dept Stat, Box 8203, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA::Ghosal, Subhashis@North Carolina State Univ, Dept Stat, Box 8203, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Suarez, Adam J.@North Carolina State University@University of North Carolina::Ghosal, Subhashis@North Carolina State University@University of North Carolina",not exist,"no title+Ash, R.+Information Theory.

Bayesian Functional Data Modeling for Heterogeneous Volatility,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA1004,JUN 2017,25,0,"Although there are many methods for functional data analysis, less emphasis is put on characterizing variability among volatilities of individual functions. In particular, certain individuals exhibit erratic swings in their trajectory while other individuals have more stable trajectories. There is evidence of such volatility heterogeneity in blood pressure trajectories during pregnancy, for example, and reason to suspect that volatility is a biologically important feature. Most functional data analysis models implicitly assume similar or identical smoothness of the individual functions, and hence can lead to misleading inferences on volatility and an inadequate representation of the functions. We propose a novel class of functional data analysis models characterized using hierarchical stochastic differential equations. We model the derivatives of a mean function and deviation functions using Gaussian processes, while also allowing covariate dependence including on the volatilities of the deviation functions. Following a Bayesian approach to inference, a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is used for posterior computation. The methods are tested on simulated data and applied to blood pressure trajectories during pregnancy.","Bayesian functional data analysis,Gaussian process,state space model,stochastic differential equation,volatility heterogeneity","TIME-SERIES,STOCHASTIC VOLATILITY,LONGITUDINAL DATA,DYNAMICS","Zhu, Bin@NCI, Biostat Branch, Div Canc Epidemiol & Genet, NIH, Rockville, MD 20852 USA::Dunson, David B.@Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Zhu, Bin@National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA@NIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)::Dunson, David B.@Duke University",not exist,"no title+Barndorff-Nielsen, O.; Shephard, N.+Financial volatility in continuous time+2012::Locally Adaptive Factor Processes for Multivariate Time Series+Durante, Daniele; Scarpa, Bruno; Dunson, David B.+JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH+APR 2014::A simple and efficient simulation smoother for state space time series analysis+Durbin, J; Koopman, SJ+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 2002::no title+Durbin, J.; Koopman, S.J.+TIME SERIES ANAL STA+2001::no title+Gu, C.+Smoothing spline ANOVA models+2013::Functional mixed effects models+Guo, WS+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2002::A CLOSED-FORM SOLUTION FOR OPTIONS WITH STOCHASTIC VOLATILITY WITH APPLICATIONS TO BOND AND CURRENCY OPTIONS+HESTON, SL+REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES+1993::Testing stationarity of functional time series+Horvath, Lajos; Kokoszka, Piotr; Rice, Gregory+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+MAR 2014::Efficient Bayesian estimation of a multivariate stochastic volatility model with cross leverage and heavy-tailed errors+Ishihara, Tsunehiro; Omori, Yasuhiro+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+NOV 2012::Bayesian analysis of stochastic volatility models (Reprinted)+Jacquier, E; Polson, NG; Rossi, PE+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JAN 2002::no title+Jones, R.H.+Longitudinal data with serial correlation: a state-space approach+1993::Selection of Multivariate Stochastic Volatility Models via Bayesian Stochastic Search+Loddo, Antonello; Ni, Shawn; Sun, Dongchu+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JUL 2011::Environmental Contributions to Disparities in Pregnancy Outcomes+Miranda, Marie Lynn; Maxson, Pamela; Edwards, Sharon+EPIDEMIOLOGIC REVIEWS+NOV 1 2009::EMPIRICAL DYNAMICS FOR LONGITUDINAL DATA+Mueller, Hans-Georg; Yao, Fang+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 2010::Functional data analysis for volatility+Mueller, Hans-Georg; Sen, Rituparna; Stadtmueller, Ulrich+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+DEC 2011::no title+Park, S.; Choi, S.+Hierarchical Gaussian process regression+2010::Blood pressure stability in hemodialysis patients confers a survival advantage: results from a large retrospective cohort study+Raimann, Jochen G.; Usvyat, Len A.; Thijssen, Stephan; et al.+KIDNEY INTERNATIONAL+MAR 2012::no title+Ramsay, J.

Latent Space Approaches to Community Detection in Dynamic Networks,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA1000,JUN 2017,39,0,"Embedding dyadic data into a latent space has long been a popular approach to modeling networks of all kinds. While clustering has been done using this approach for static networks, this paper gives two methods of community detection within dynamic network data, building upon the distance and projection models previously proposed in the literature. Our proposed approaches capture the time-varying aspect of the data, can model directed or undirected edges, inherently incorporate transitivity and account for each actor's individual propensity to form edges. We provide Bayesian estimation algorithms, and apply these methods to a ranked dynamic friendship network and world export/import data.","clustering,longitudinal data,Markov chain Monte Carlo,mixture model,Polya-Gamma distribution,variational Bayes","BAYESIAN-INFERENCE,SOCIAL NETWORKS,MODEL,DISTRIBUTIONS","Sewell, Daniel K.@Univ Iowa, Dept Biostat, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA::Chen, Yuguo@Univ Illinois, Dept Stat, Champaign, IL 61820 USA","Sewell, Daniel K.@University of Iowa::Chen, Yuguo@University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign@University of Illinois System","Sewell, Daniel@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9238-4026","A latent mixed membership model for relational data+AIROLDI, E.; BLEI, D.; XING, E.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; FIENBERG, S</span>.+P 3 INT WORKSH LINK+2005::Clustering on the unit hypersphere using von Mises-Fisher distributions+Banerjee, A; Dhillon, IS; Ghosh, J; et al.+JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH+SEP 2005::no title+Blasier, C.+The Giant's Rival: The USSR and Latin America+1988::The Polya-Gamma Gibbs sampler for Bayesian logistic regression is uniformly ergodic+Choi, Hee Min; Hobert, James P.+ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+2013::Finding community structure in very large networks+Clauset, A; Newman, MEJ; Moore, C+PHYSICAL REVIEW E+DEC 2004::MULTIDIMENSIONAL-SCALING ON A SPHERE+COX, TF; COX, MAA+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1991::The igraph software package for complex network research+Csardi, G.; Nepusz, T.+InterJournal Complex Systems+2006::Nonparametric Bayes dynamic modelling of relational data+Durante, Daniele; Dunson, David B.+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 2014::Bayesian regularization for normal mixture estimation and model-based clustering+Fraley, Chris; Raftery, Adrian E.+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+SEP 2007::A mixture of experts latent position cluster model for social network data+Gormley, I.

Dependent Species Sampling Models for Spatial Density Estimation,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA1006,JUN 2017,59,5,"We consider a novel Bayesian nonparametric model for density estimation with an underlying spatial structure. The model is built on a class of species sampling models, which are discrete random probability measures that can be represented as a mixture of random support points and random weights. Specifically, we construct a collection of spatially dependent species sampling models and propose a mixture model based on this collection. The key idea is the introduction of spatial dependence by modeling the weights through a conditional autoregressive model. We present an extensive simulation study to compare the performance of the proposed model with competitors. The proposed model compares favorably to these alternatives. We apply the method to the estimation of summer precipitation density functions using Climate Prediction Center Merged Analysis of Precipitation data over East Asia.","climate prediction,conditional autoregressive model,spatial density estimation,species sampling model","STICK-BREAKING PROCESSES,DIRICHLET PROCESS,PRIORS,DISTRIBUTIONS,RESTORATION,FIELDS","Jo, Seongil@Chonbuk Natl Univ, Inst Appl Stat, Dept Stat, Jeonju, South Korea::Lee, Jaeyong@Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Stat, Seoul, South Korea::Mueller, Peter@Univ Texas Austin, Dept Math, Austin, TX 78712 USA::Quintana, Fernando A.@Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Estadis, Santiago, Chile::Trippa, Lorenzo@Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Biostat, Boston, MA 02115 USA@Havard Univ, Cambridge, MA USA","Jo, Seongil@Chonbuk National University::Lee, Jaeyong@Seoul National University::Mueller, Peter@University of Texas Austin@University of Texas System::Quintana, Fernando A.@Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile::Trippa, Lorenzo@Dana-Farber Cancer Institute@Harvard University@VA Boston Healthcare System",not exist,"Generalized Species Sampling Priors With Latent Beta Reinforcements+Airoldi, Edoardo M.; Costa, Thiago; Bassetti, Federico; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2014::BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS OF BINARY AND POLYCHOTOMOUS RESPONSE DATA+ALBERT, JH; CHIB, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1993::no title+Banerjee, S.; Carlin, B.

A Hierarchical Bayesian Setting for an Inverse Problem in Linear Parabolic PDEs with Noisy Boundary Conditions,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA1007,JUN 2017,24,2,"In this work we develop a Bayesian setting to infer unknown parameters in initial-boundary value problems related to linear parabolic partial differential equations. We realistically assume that the boundary data are noisy, for a given prescribed initial condition. We show how to derive the joint likelihood function for the forward problem, given some measurements of the solution field subject to Gaussian noise. Given Gaussian priors for the time-dependent Dirichlet boundary values, we analytically marginalize the joint likelihood using the linearity of the equation. Our hierarchical Bayesian approach is fully implemented in an example that involves the heat equation. In this example, the thermal diffusivity is the unknown parameter. We assume that the thermal diffusivity parameter can be modeled a priori through a lognormal random variable or by means of a space-dependent stationary lognormal random field. Synthetic data are used to test the inference. We exploit the behavior of the non-normalized log posterior distribution of the thermal diffusivity. Then, we use the Laplace method to obtain an approximated Gaussian posterior and therefore avoid costly Markov Chain Monte Carlo computations. Expected information gains and predictive posterior densities for observable quantities are numerically estimated using Laplace approximation for different experimental setups.","linear parabolic PDEs,noisy boundary parameters,Bayesian inference,heat equation,thermal diffusivity","PARTIAL-DIFFERENTIAL-EQUATIONS,HEAT-CONDUCTION,PARAMETERS","Ruggeri, Fabrizio@CNR, IMATI, Milan, Italy::Sawlan, Zaid@King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, CEMSE, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia::Scavino, Marco@King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, CEMSE, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia@Univ Republica, Inst Estadist IESTA, Montevideo, Uruguay::Tempone, Raul@King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, CEMSE, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia","Ruggeri, Fabrizio@Istituto di Matematica Applicata e Tecnologie Informatiche ""Enrico Magenes"" (IMATI-CNR)@Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR)::Sawlan, Zaid@King Abdullah University of Science & Technology::Scavino, Marco@University of the Republic - Uruguay@King Abdullah University of Science & Technology::Tempone, Raul@King Abdullah University of Science & Technology","Sawlan, Zaid@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4361-2491::RUGGERI, FABRIZIO@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7655-6254","Fitting partial differential equations to space-time dynamics+Bar, M; Hegger, R; Kantz, H+PHYSICAL REVIEW E+JAN 1999::STRONG AND WEAK ERROR ESTIMATES FOR ELLIPTIC PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS WITH RANDOM COEFFICIENTS+Charrier, Julia+SIAM JOURNAL ON NUMERICAL ANALYSIS+2012::Probability measures for numerical solutions of differential equations+Conrad, P.

Bayesian Inference for Diffusion-Driven Mixed-Effects Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA1009,JUN 2017,42,0,"Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) provide a natural framework for modelling intrinsic stochasticity inherent in many continuous-time physical processes. When such processes are observed in multiple individuals or experimental units, SDE driven mixed-effects models allow the quantification of both between and within individual variation. Performing Bayesian inference for such models using discrete-time data that may be incomplete and subject to measurement error is a challenging problem and is the focus of this paper. We extend a recently proposed MCMC scheme to include the SDE driven mixed-effects framework. Fundamental to our approach is the development of a novel construct that allows for efficient sampling of conditioned SDEs that may exhibit nonlinear dynamics between observation times. We apply the resulting scheme to synthetic data generated from a simple SDE model of orange tree growth, and real data on aphid numbers recorded under a variety of different treatment regimes. In addition, we provide a systematic comparison of our approach with an inference scheme based on a tractable approximation of the SDE, that is, the linear noise approximation.","stochastic differential equation,mixed-effects,Markov chain Monte Carlo,modified innovation scheme,linear noise approximation","STOCHASTIC DIFFERENTIAL-EQUATIONS,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,LINEAR NOISE APPROXIMATION,POPULATION-GROWTH MODELS,MULTIVARIATE DIFFUSIONS,PARAMETER-ESTIMATION,MARKOV-PROCESSES,MONTE-CARLO,IMPLEMENTATION,EXPANSIONS","Whitaker, Gavin A.@Newcastle Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England::Golightly, Andrew@Newcastle Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England::Boys, Richard J.@Newcastle Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England::Sherlock, Chris@Univ Lancaster, Dept Math & Stat, Lancaster LA1 4YF, England","Whitaker, Gavin A.@Newcastle University - UK::Golightly, Andrew@Newcastle University - UK::Boys, Richard J.@Newcastle University - UK::Sherlock, Chris@Lancaster University","Sherlock, Chris@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2429-3157","Maximum likelihood estimation of discretely sampled diffusions: A closed-form approximation approach+Ait-Sahalia, Y+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 2002::Closed-form likelihood expansions for multivariate diffusions+Ait-Sahalia, Yacine+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2008::Investigations of a compartmental model for leucine kinetics using non-linear mixed effects models with ordinary and stochastic differential equations+Berglund, Martin; Sunnaker, Mikael; Adiels, Martin; et al.+MATHEMATICAL MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY-A JOURNAL OF THE IMA+DEC 2012::Exact and computationally efficient likelihood-based estimation for discretely observed diffusion processes (with discussion)+Beskos, A; Papaspiliopoulos, O; Roberts, GO; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2006::Advanced MCMC methods for sampling on diffusion pathspace+Beskos, Alexandros; Kalogeropoulos, Konstantinos; Pazos, Erik+STOCHASTIC PROCESSES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS+APR 2013::Likelihood based inference for diffusion driven models+Chib, S.; Pitt, M.

Automated Parameter Blocking for Efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo Sampling,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA1008,JUN 2017,47,2,"Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling is an important and commonly used tool for the analysis of hierarchical models. Nevertheless, practitioners generally have two options for MCMC: utilize existing software that generates a black-box ""one size fits all"" algorithm, or the challenging (and time consuming) task of implementing a problem-specific MCMC algorithm. Either choice may result in inefficient sampling, and hence researchers have become accustomed to MCMC runtimes on the order of days (or longer) for large models. We propose an automated procedure to determine an efficient MCMC block-sampling algorithm for a given model and computing platform. Our procedure dynamically determines blocks of parameters for joint sampling that result in efficient MCMC sampling of the entire model. We test this procedure using a diverse suite of example models, and observe non-trivial improvements in MCMC efficiency for many models. Our procedure is the first attempt at such, and may be generalized to a broader space of MCMC algorithms. Our results suggest that substantive improvements in MCMC efficiency may be practically realized using our automated blocking procedure, or variants thereof, which warrants additional study and application.","MCMC,Metropolis-Hastings,block sampling,integrated autocorrelation time,mixing,NIMBLE","METROPOLIS ALGORITHMS,GIBBS SAMPLER,HASTINGS,MODELS,CONVERGENCE,LIKELIHOOD,SCHEMES,MCMC","Turek, Daniel@Univ Calif Berkeley, 493 Evans Hall, Berkeley, CA 94704 USA::de Valpine, Perry@Univ Calif Berkeley, 201 Wellman Hall, Berkeley, CA 94704 USA::Paciorek, Christopher J.@Univ Calif Berkeley, 495 Evans Hall, Berkeley, CA 94704 USA::Anderson-Bergman, Clifford@Univ Calif Berkeley, 493 Evans Hall, Berkeley, CA 94704 USA","Turek, Daniel@University of California System@University of California Berkeley::de Valpine, Perry@University of California System@University of California Berkeley::Paciorek, Christopher J.@University of California System@University of California Berkeley::Anderson-Bergman, Clifford@University of California System@University of California Berkeley",not exist,"no title+Banerjee, S.; Carlin, B.

Dynamic Chain Graph Models for Time Series Network Data,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA1010,JUN 2017,44,0,"This paper introduces a new class of Bayesian dynamic models for inference and forecasting in high-dimensional time series observed on networks. The new model, called the dynamic chain graph model, is suitable for multivariate time series which exhibit symmetries within subsets of series and a causal drive mechanism between these subsets. The model can accommodate high-dimensional, non-linear and non-normal time series and enables local and parallel computation by decomposing the multivariate problem into separate, simpler sub-problems of lower dimensions. The advantages of the new model are illustrated by forecasting traffic network flows and also modelling gene expression data from transcriptional networks.","chain graph,multiregression dynamic model,network traffic flow forecasting,gene expression networks,network data,time series","GENE-EXPRESSION DATA,ROAD TRAFFIC FLOWS","Anacleto, Osvaldo@Univ Edinburgh, Roslin Inst, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland@Univ Edinburgh, R D SVS, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland::Queen, Catriona@Open Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Milton Keynes, Bucks, England","Anacleto, Osvaldo@University of Edinburgh@BBSRC Roslin Institute::Queen, Catriona@Open University - UK",not exist,"Sparse time series chain graphical models for reconstructing genetic networks+Abegaz, Fentaw; Wit, Ernst+BIOSTATISTICS+JUL 2013::Supplementary material for paper: Dynamic chain graph models for time series network data+Anacleto, O.; Queen, C.+Bayesian Analysis+2016::no title+Anacleto, O.+Bayesian dynamic graphical models for high-dimensional flow forecasting in road traffic networks+2012::Forecasting Multivariate Road Traffic Flows Using Bayesian Dynamic Graphical Models, Splines and Other Traffic Variables+Anacleto, Osvaldo; Queen, Catriona; Albers, Casper J.+AUSTRALIAN &amp; NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+JUN 2013::Multivariate forecasting of road traffic flows in the presence of heteroscedasticity and measurement errors+Anacleto, Osvaldo; Queen, Catriona; Albers, Casper J.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2013::STUDY DESIGNS Studying and modelling dynamic biological processes using time-series gene expression data+Bar-Joseph, Ziv; Gitter, Anthony; Simon, Itamar+NATURE REVIEWS GENETICS+AUG 2012::A Yeast Synthetic Network for In Vivo Assessment of Reverse-Engineering and Modeling Approaches+Cantone, Irene; Marucci, Lucia; Iorio, Francesco; et al.+CELL+APR 2 2009::Dynamic Matrix-Variate Graphical Models+Carvalho, Carlos M.; West, Mike+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2007::Searching Multiregression Dynamic Models of Resting-State fMRI Networks Using Integer Programming+Costa, Lilia; Smith, Jim; Nichols, Thomas; et al.+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+JUN 2015::no title+Cox, D.

Mixtures of g-Priors for Analysis of Variance Models with a Diverging Number of Parameters,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA1011,JUN 2017,37,0,"We consider Bayesian approaches for the hypothesis testing problem in the analysis-of-variance (ANOVA) models. With the aid of the singular value decomposition of the centered designed matrix, we reparameterize the ANOVA models with linear constraints for uniqueness into a standard linear regression model without any constraint. We derive the Bayes factors based on mixtures of g-priors and study their consistency properties with a growing number of parameters. It is shown that two commonly used hyper-priors on g (the Zellner-Siow prior and the beta-prime prior) yield inconsistent Bayes factors due to the presence of an inconsistency region around the null model. We propose a new class of hyper-priors to avoid this inconsistency problem. Simulation studies on the two-way ANOVA models are conducted to compare the performance of the proposed procedures with that of some existing ones in the literature.","ANOVA models,Bayes factor,consistency,growing number of parameters,Zellner's g-prior","BAYES FACTOR CONSISTENCY,VARIABLE SELECTION,DIMENSION GROWS,LINEAR-MODELS,ANOVA DESIGNS","Wang, Min@Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Math Sci, Houghton, MI 49931 USA","Wang, Min@Michigan Technological University","Wang, Min@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9233-7844","CRITERIA FOR BAYESIAN MODEL CHOICE WITH APPLICATION TO VARIABLE SELECTION+Bayarri, M.

Data-Dependent Posterior Propriety of a Bayesian Beta-Binomial-Logit Model,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA1012,JUN 2017,20,1,"A Beta-Binomial-Logit model is a Beta-Binomial model with covariate information incorporated via a logistic regression. Posterior propriety of a Bayesian Beta-Binomial-Logit model can be data-dependent for improper hyperprior distributions. Various researchers in the literature have unknowingly used improper posterior distributions or have given incorrect statements about posterior propriety because checking posterior propriety can be challenging due to the complicated functional form of a Beta-Binomial-Logit model. We derive data-dependent necessary and sufficient conditions for posterior propriety within a class of hyper-prior distributions that encompass those used in previous studies. When a posterior is improper due to improper hyper-prior distributions, we suggest using proper hyper-prior distributions that can mimic the behaviors of improper choices.","objective Bayes,hierarchical models,random effects,overdispersion,logistic regression,beta-binomial,uniform shrinkage prior","LINEAR MIXED MODELS,LOGISTIC-REGRESSION,HIERARCHICAL-MODELS,DISTRIBUTIONS","Tak, Hyungsuk@Harvard Univ, Dept Stat, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA::Morris, Carl N.@Harvard Univ, Dept Stat, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Tak, Hyungsuk@Harvard University::Morris, Carl N.@Harvard University",not exist,"ON THE EXISTENCE OF MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATES IN LOGISTIC-REGRESSION MODELS+ALBERT, A; ANDERSON, JA+BIOMETRIKA+1984::COMPUTATIONAL METHODS USING A BAYESIAN HIERARCHICAL GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODEL+ALBERT, JH+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1988::Monte Carlo methods for improper target distributions+Athreya, Krishna B.; Roy, Vivekananda+ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+2014::Hierarchical Poisson regression modeling+Christiansen, CL; Morris, CN+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1997::A prior for the variance in hierarchical models+Daniels, MJ+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+SEP 1999::DATA-ANALYSIS USING STEINS ESTIMATOR AND ITS GENERALIZATIONS+EFRON, B; MORRIS, C+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1975::no title+Gelman, A.; Carlin, J.

"Variational Bayes for Functional Data Registration, Smoothing, and Prediction",BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA1013,JUN 2017,34,0,"We propose a model for functional data registration that extends current inferential capabilities for unregistered data by providing a flexible probabilistic framework that 1) allows for functional prediction in the context of registration and 2) can be adapted to include smoothing and registration in one model. The proposed inferential framework is a Bayesian hierarchical model where the registered functions are modeled as Gaussian processes. To address the computational demands of inference in high-dimensional Bayesian models, we propose an adapted form of the variational Bayes algorithm for approximate inference that performs similarly to Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods for well-defined problems. The efficiency of the adapted variational Bayes (AVB) algorithm allows variability in a predicted registered, warping, and unregistered function to be depicted separately via bootstrapping. Temperature data related to the El-Nino phenomenon is used to demonstrate the unique inferential capabilities for prediction provided by this model.","Bayesian modeling,functional data,functional prediction,registration,smoothing,variational Bayes","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,CURVE REGISTRATION,ALIGNMENT,SYNCHRONIZATION,MODELS","Earls, Cecilia@Dept Biol Stat & Computat Biol, 1198 Comstock Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA::Hooker, Giles@Dept Biol Stat & Computat Biol, 1198 Comstock Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Earls, Cecilia@Unknow::Hooker, Giles@Unknow",not exist,"CALIBRATING PREDICTION REGIONS+BERAN, R+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1990::no title+BISHOP, C.

Bayesian Inference and Model Assessment for Spatial Point Patterns Using Posterior Predictive Samples,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA985,MAR 2017,54,4,"Spatial point pattern data describes locations of events observed over a given domain, with the number of and locations of these events being random. Historically, data analysis for spatial point patterns has focused on rejecting complete spatial randomness and then on fitting a richer model specification. From a Bayesian standpoint, the literature is growing but primarily considers versions of Poisson processes, focusing on specifications for the intensity. However, the Bayesian literature on, e.g., clustering or inhibition processes is limited, primarily attending to model fitting. There is little attention given to full inference and scant with regard to model adequacy or model comparison.

The contribution here is full Bayesian analysis, implemented through generation of posterior point patterns using composition. Model features, hence broad inference, can be explored through functions of these samples. The approach is general, applicable to any generative model for spatial point patterns.

The approach is also useful in considering model criticism and model selection both in-sample and, when possible, out-of-sample. Here, we adapt or extend familiar tools. In particular, for model criticism, we consider Bayesian residuals, realized and predictive, along with empirical coverage and prior predictive checks through Monte Carlo tests. For model choice, we propose strategies using predictive mean square error, empirical coverage, and ranked probability scores. For simplicity, we illustrate these methods with standard models such as Poisson processes, log-Gaussian Cox processes, and Gibbs processes. The utility of our approach is demonstrated using a simulation study and two real datasets.","Cox process,cross-validation,Gibbs process,Markov chain Monte Carlo,nonhomogeneous Poisson process,predictive residuals,ranked probability scores,realized residuals,Strauss process","NONHOMOGENEOUS POISSON PROCESSES,PERFECT SIMULATION,LIKELIHOOD,DENSITY","Leininger, Thomas J.@Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27708 USA::Gelfand, Alan E.@Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Leininger, Thomas J.@Duke University::Gelfand, Alan E.@Duke University",not exist,"BAYES FACTORS FOR NONHOMOGENEOUS POISSON PROCESSES WITH VAGUE PRIOR INFORMATION+AKMAN, VE; RAFTERY, AE+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1986::Properties of residuals for spatial point processes+Baddeley, A.; Moller, J.; Pakes, A.

Bayesian Two-Stage Design for Phase II Clinical Trials with Switching Hypothesis Tests,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA988,MAR 2017,31,0,"Conventional phase II clinical trials use either a single-arm or a double-arm scheme to examine the treatment effect of an investigational drug. The hypotheses tests under these two schemes are different, as a single-arm study usually tests the response rate of the new drug against a set of fixed reference rates and a double-arm randomized trial compares the new drug with the standard treatment or placebo. To bridge the single-and double-arm schemes in one phase II clinical trial, we propose a Bayesian two-stage design with changing hypothesis tests. Stage 1 enrolls patients solely to the experimental arm to make a comparison with the reference rates, and stage 2 imposes a double-arm comparison of the experimental arm with the control arm. The design is calibrated with respect to error rates from both the frequentist and Bayesian perspectives. Moreover, we control the ""type III error rate"", defined as the probability of prematurely stopping the trial at stage 1 when the trial is supposed to move on to stage 2. We conduct extensive simulations on the calculations of these error rates to examine the operational characteristics of our proposed method, and illustrate it with a non-small cell lung cancer trial.","Bayesian error rates,expected sample size,phase II clinical trial,single-to-double arm design,two-stage procedure,type I error,type II error","CANCER TRIALS,FREQUENTIST,GUIDELINES,SELECTION,PRIORS","Shi, Haolun@Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, 91 Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China::Yin, Guosheng@Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, 91 Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Shi, Haolun@University of Hong Kong::Yin, Guosheng@University of Hong Kong",not exist,"DESIGNS FOR GROUP SEQUENTIAL PHASE-II CLINICAL-TRIALS+CHANG, MN; THERNEAU, TM; WIEAND, HS; et al.+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1987::Optimal flexible designs in phase II clinical trials+Chen, TT; Ng, TH+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+OCT 30 1998::A Bayesian-frequentist two-stage single-arm phase II clinical trial design+Dong, Gaohong; Shih, Weichung Joe; Moore, Dirk; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+AUG 30 2012::ONE-SAMPLE MULTIPLE TESTING PROCEDURE FOR PHASE-II CLINICAL-TRIALS+FLEMING, TR+BIOMETRICS+1982::DETERMINATION OF NUMBER OF PATIENTS REQUIRED IN A PRELIMINARY AND A FOLLOW-UP TRIAL OF A NEW CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENT+GEHAN, EA+JOURNAL OF CHRONIC DISEASES+1961::PLANNED VERSUS ATTAINED DESIGN IN PHASE-II CLINICAL-TRIALS+GREEN, SJ; DAHLBERG, S+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+MAY 1992::Commensurate Priors for Incorporating Historical Information in Clinical Trials Using General and Generalized Linear Models+Hobbs, Brian P.; Sargent, Daniel J.; Carlin, Bradley P.+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2012::Hierarchical Commensurate and Power Prior Models for Adaptive Incorporation of Historical Information in Clinical Trials+Hobbs, Brian P.; Carlin, Bradley P.; Mandrekar, Sumithra J.; et al.+BIOMETRICS+SEP 2011::Seamlessly expanding a randomized phase II trial to phase III+Inoue, LYT; Thall, PF; Berry, DA+BIOMETRICS+DEC 2002::Sequential design of phase II-III cancer trials+Lai, Tze Leung; Lavori, Philip W.; Shih, Mei-Chiung+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+AUG 15 2012::A predictive probability design for phase II cancer clinical trials+Lee, J.

Bayesian Nonparametric Tests via Sliced Inverse Modeling,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA993,MAR 2017,25,0,"We study the problem of independence and conditional independence tests between categorical covariates and a continuous response variable, which has an immediate application in genetics. Instead of estimating the conditional distribution of the response given values of covariates, we model the conditional distribution of covariates given the discretized response (aka ""slices""). By assigning a prior probability to each possible discretization scheme, we can compute efficiently a Bayes factor (BF)-statistic for the independence (or conditional independence) test using a dynamic programming algorithm. Asymptotic and finite-sample properties such as power and null distribution of the BF statistic are studied, and a stepwise variable selection method based on the BF statistic is further developed. We compare the BF statistic with some existing classical methods and demonstrate its statistical power through extensive simulation studies. We apply the proposed method to a mouse genetics data set aiming to detect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and obtain promising results.","Bayes factor,dynamic programming,non-parametric tests,sliced inverse model,variable selection","GENETIC DISSECTION,TRAITS,EXPRESSION,INFERENCE,MIXTURES,YEAST","Jiang, Bo@Two Sigma Investments LLC, 100 Ave Amer,Floor 16, New York, NY 10013 USA::Ye, Chao@Tsinghua Univ, Bioinformat Div, MOE Key Lab Bioinformat, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China@Tsinghua Univ, Dept Automat, TNLIST, Ctr Synthet & Syst Biol, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China::Liu, Jun S.@Tsinghua Univ, Bioinformat Div, MOE Key Lab Bioinformat, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China@Tsinghua Univ, Dept Automat, TNLIST, Ctr Synthet & Syst Biol, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China@Harvard Univ, Dept Stat, 1 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Jiang, Bo@Unknow::Ye, Chao@Tsinghua University::Liu, Jun S.@Harvard University@Tsinghua University",not exist,"ASYMPTOTIC THEORY OF CERTAIN GOODNESS OF FIT CRITERIA BASED ON STOCHASTIC PROCESSES+ANDERSON, TW; DARLING, DA+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1952::A Nonparametric Test to Detect Quantitative Trait Loci Where the Phenotypic Distribution Differs by Genotypes+Aschard, Hugues; Zaitlen, Noah; Tamimi, Rulla M.; et al.+GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY+MAY 2013::Marginal likelihood and Bayes factors for Dirichlet process mixture models+Basu, S; Chib, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2003::Bayesian and conditional frequentist testing of a parametric model versus nonparametric alternatives+Berger, JO; Guglielmi, A+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2001::Genetic dissection of transcriptional regulation in budding yeast+Brem, RB; Yvert, G; Clinton, R; et al.+SCIENCE+APR 26 2002::Dissection of complex adult traits in a mouse synthetic population+Burke, David T.; Kozloff, Kenneth M.; Chen, Shu; et al.+GENOME RESEARCH+AUG 2012::On Bayes factors for nonparametric alternatives+Carota, C.; Parmigiani, G.+Bayesian Statistics+1996::Bayesian encompassing specification tests of a parametric model against a nonparametric alternative+Florens, J.-P.; Richard, J.-F.; Rolin, J.+Technical Report 96.08+1996::Inference for mixtures of finite Polya tree models+Hanson, Timothy E.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2006::Two-sample Bayesian Nonparametric Hypothesis Testing+Holmes, Chris C.; Caron, Francois; Griffin, Jim E.; et al.+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+JUN 2015::Supplement to  Bayesian Nonparametric Tests via Sliced Inverse Modeling+Jiang, B.; Ye, C.; Liu, J.

The General Projected Normal Distribution of Arbitrary Dimension: Modeling and Bayesian Inference,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA989,MAR 2017,42,6,"The general projected normal distribution is a simple and intuitive model for directional data in any dimension: a multivariate normal random vector divided by its length is the projection of that vector onto the surface of the unit hypersphere. Observed data consist of the projections, but not the lengths. Inference for this model has been restricted to the two-dimensional (circular) case, using Bayesian methods with data augmentation to generate the latent lengths and a Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm to sample from the posterior. We describe a new parameterization of the general projected normal distribution that makes inference in any dimension tractable, including the important three-dimensional (spherical) case, which has not previously been considered. Under this new parameterization, the full conditionals of the unknown parameters have closed forms, and we propose a new slice sampler to draw the latent lengths without the need for rejection. Gibbs sampling with this new scheme is fast and easy, leading to improved Bayesian inference; for example, it is now feasible to conduct model selection among complex mixture and regression models for large data sets. Our parameterization also allows straightforward incorporation of covariates into the covariance matrix of the multivariate normal, increasing the ability of the model to explain directional data as a function of independent regressors. Circular and spherical cases are considered in detail and illustrated with scientific applications. For the circular case, seasonal variation in time-of-day departures of anglers from recreational fishing sites is modeled using covariates in both the mean vector and covariance matrix. For the spherical case, we consider paired angles that describe the relative positions of carbon atoms along the backbone chain of a protein. We fit mixtures of general projected normals to these data, with the best-fitting mixture accurately describing biologically meaningful structures including helices, beta-sheets, and coils and turns. Finally, we show via simulation that our methodology has satisfactory performance in some 10-dimensional and 50-dimensional problems.","circular data,directional data,Gibbs sampler,Markov chain Monte Carlo,protein structure analysis,spherical data","DIRECTIONAL-DATA,CIRCULAR DATA,REPRESENTATION,STATISTICS,REGRESSION","Hernandez-Stumpfhauser, Daniel@Univ N Carolina, Dept Biostat, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA::Breidt, F.

Hierarchical Shrinkage Priors for Regression Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA990,MAR 2017,50,0,"In some linear models, such as those with interactions, it is natural to include the relationship between the regression coefficients in the analysis. In this paper, we consider how robust hierarchical continuous prior distributions can be used to express dependence between the size but not the sign of the regression coefficients. For example, to include ideas of heredity in the analysis of linear models with interactions. We develop a simple method for controlling the shrinkage of regression effects to zero at different levels of the hierarchy by considering the behaviour of the continuous prior at zero.

Bayesian Endogenous Tobit Quantile Regression,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA996,MAR 2017,81,1,"This study proposes p-th Tobit quantile regression models with endogenous variables. In the first stage regression of the endogenous variable on the exogenous variables, the assumption that the alpha-th quantile of the error term is zero is introduced. Then, the residual of this regression model is included in the p-th quantile regression model in such a way that the p-th conditional quantile of the new error term is zero. The error distribution of the first stage regression is modelled around the zero alpha-th quantile assumption by using parametric and semiparametric approaches. Since the value of alpha is a priori unknown, it is treated as an additional parameter and is estimated from the data. The proposed models are then demonstrated by using simulated data and real data on the labour supply of married women.","asymmetric Laplace distribution,Bayesian Tobit quantile regression,Dirichlet process mixture,endogenous variable,Markov chain Monte Carlo,skew normal distribution","ABSOLUTE DEVIATIONS ESTIMATORS,DEPENDENT VARIABLE MODELS,SAMPLING METHODS,CENSORED-DATA,HEALTH-CARE,INFERENCE,DISTRIBUTIONS,SELECTION,MIXTURES,PRIORS","Kobayashi, Genya@Chiba Univ, Fac Law Polit & Econ, Chiba 2638522, Japan","Kobayashi, Genya@Chiba University",not exist,"Instrumental variables estimates of the effect of subsidized training on the quantiles of trainee earnings+Abadie, A; Angrist, J; Imbens, G+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 2002::Bayesian elastic net Tobit quantile regression+Alhamzawi, R.+Communications in Statistics-Simulation and Computation+2014::Bayesian Tobit quantile regression using g-prior distribution with ridge parameter+Alhamzawi, Rahim; Yu, Keming+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+SEP 22 2015::2 STAGE LEAST ABSOLUTE DEVIATIONS ESTIMATORS+AMEMIYA, T+ECONOMETRICA+1982::ESTIMATION OF A SIMULTANEOUS-EQUATION TOBIT MODEL+AMEMIYA, T+INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC REVIEW+1979::Distributions generated by perturbation of symmetry with emphasis on a multivariate skew t-distribution+Azzalini, A; Capitanio, A+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2003::Non-Gaussian Ornstein-Uhlenbeck-based models and some of their uses in financial economics+Barndorff-Nielsen, OE; Shephard, N+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2001::Simple resampling methods for censored regression quantiles+Bilias, Y; Chen, S; Ying, Z.+J Econ.+2000::Censored regression quantiles with endogenous regressors+Blundell, Richard; Powell, James L.+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+NOV 2007::ESTIMATION IN A CLASS OF SIMULTANEOUS EQUATION LIMITED DEPENDENT VARIABLE MODELS+BLUNDELL, RW; SMITH, RJ+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+JAN 1989::An alternative estimator for the censored quantile regression model+Buchinsky, M; Hahn, JY+ECONOMETRICA+MAY 1998::Recent advances in quantile regression models - A practical guideline for empirical research+Buchinsky, M+JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCES+WIN 1998::An integrated maximum score estimator for a generalized censored quantile regression model+Chen, Songnian+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+MAR 2010::An IV model of quantile treatment effects+Chernozhukov, V; Hansen, C+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 2005::An MCMC approach to classical estimation+Chernozhukov, V; Hong, H+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+AUG 2003::Three-step censored quantile regression and extramarital affairs+Chernozhukov, V; Hong, H+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2002::INFERENCE ON COUNTERFACTUAL DISTRIBUTIONS+Chernozhukov, Victor; Fernandez-Val, Ivan; Melly, Blaise+ECONOMETRICA+NOV 2013::Quantile regression with censoring and endogeneity+Chernozhukov, Victor; Fernandez-Val, Ivan; Kowalski, Amanda E.+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+MAY 2015::Instrumental variable quantile regression: A robust inference approach+Chernozhukov, Victor; Hansen, Christian+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JAN 2008::Instrumental quantile regression inference for structural and treatment effect models+Chernozhukov, Victor; Hansen, Christian+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUN 2006::Markov chain Monte Carlo methods: computation and inference+Chib, S.+HDB ECONOMETRICS+2001::A semi-parametric Bayesian approach to the instrumental variable problem+Conley, Timothy G.; Hansen, Christian B.; McCulloch, Robert E.; et al.+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+MAY 2008::Bayesian analysis of the two-part model with endogeneity: Application to health care expenditure+Deb, Partha; Munkin, Murat K.; Trivedi, Pravin K.+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+NOV 2006::no title+Doornik, J.+Ox: Object Oriented Matrix Programming+2007::BAYESIAN DENSITY-ESTIMATION AND INFERENCE USING MIXTURES+ESCOBAR, MD; WEST, M+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1995::Bayesian inference for finite mixtures of univariate and multivariate skew-normal and skew-t distributions+Fruehwirth-Schnatter, Sylvia; Pyne, Saumyadipta+BIOSTATISTICS+APR 2010::no title+Gelman, A.; Carlin, J.

Bayesian Detection of Abnormal Segments in Multiple Time Series,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA998,MAR 2017,25,1,"We present a novel Bayesian approach to analysing multiple time-series with the aim of detecting abnormal regions. These are regions where the properties of the data change from some normal or baseline behaviour. We allow for the possibility that such changes will only be present in a, potentially small, subset of the time-series. We develop a general model for this problem, and show how it is possible to accurately and efficiently perform Bayesian inference, based upon recursions that enable independent sampling from the posterior distribution. A motivating application for this problem comes from detecting copy number variation (CNVs), using data from multiple individuals. Pooling information across individuals can increase the power of detecting CNVs, but often a specific CNV will only be present in a small subset of the individuals. We evaluate the Bayesian method on both simulated and real CNV data, and give evidence that this approach is more accurate than a recently proposed method for analysing such data.","BARD,changepoint detection,copy number variation,PASS","CHANGEPOINT PROBLEMS,INFERENCE,MODELS,SEQUENCES,VARIANTS","Bardwell, Lawrence@Univ Lancaster, STOR i CDT, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England::Fearnhead, Paul@Univ Lancaster, STOR i CDT, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England","Bardwell, Lawrence@Lancaster University::Fearnhead, Paul@Lancaster University",not exist,"Supplementary Material of Bayesian detection of abnormal segments in multiple time series+Bardwell, L.; Fearnhead, P.+Bayesian Analysis.+2016::PRODUCT PARTITION MODELS FOR CHANGE POINT PROBLEMS+BARRY, D; HARTIGAN, JA+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+MAR 1992::no title+Berger, J.+Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis+1985::ON GIBBS SAMPLING FOR STATE-SPACE MODELS+CARTER, CK; KOHN, R+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1994::no title+COX, D.

These are smoothing splines with both smoothing parameter and penalty order determined via the empirical Bayes method from the marginal likelihood of the model. The selected order and smoothing parameter are used to construct adaptive credible sets with good frequentist coverage for the underlying regression function.

Towards a Multidimensional Approach to Bayesian Disease Mapping,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA995,MAR 2017,17,1,"Multivariate disease mapping enriches traditional disease mapping studies by analysing several diseases jointly. This yields improved estimates of the geographical distribution of risk from the diseases by enabling borrowing of information across diseases. Beyond multivariate smoothing for several diseases, several other variables, such as sex, age group, race, time period, and so on, could also be jointly considered to derive multivariate estimates. The resulting multivariate structures should induce an appropriate covariance model for the data. In this paper, we introduce a formal framework for the analysis of multivariate data arising from the combination of more than two variables (geographical units and at least two more variables), what we have called Multidimensional Disease Mapping. We develop a theoretical framework containing both separable and nonseparable dependence structures and illustrate its performance on the study of real mortality data in Comunitat Valenciana (Spain).",,"MODELING FRAMEWORK,SMOOTHED-ANOVA","Martinez-Beneito, Miguel A.@Fdn El Fomento Invest Sanitaria & Biomed FISABIO, Valencia, Spain@CIBER Epidemiol & Salud Publ, Madrid, Spain::Botella-Rocamora, Paloma@Fdn El Fomento Invest Sanitaria & Biomed FISABIO, Valencia, Spain@Subdirecc Gral Epidemiol & Vigilancia Salud Cons, Valencia, Spain::Banerjee, Sudipto@Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA","Martinez-Beneito, Miguel A.@CIBERESP@CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red::Botella-Rocamora, Paloma@Unknow::Banerjee, Sudipto@University of California Los Angeles@University of California System","Martinez-Beneito, Miguel A.@M-8616-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8406-8050","no title+Banerjee, S.; Roy, A.+Linear Algebra and Matrix Analysis for Statistics+2014::A unifying modeling framework for highly multivariate disease mapping+Botella-Rocamora, P.; Martinez-Beneito, M.

Estimating the Marginal Likelihood Using the Arithmetic Mean Identity,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA1001,MAR 2017,45,4,"In this paper we propose a conceptually straightforward method to estimate the marginal data density value (also called the marginal likelihood). We show that the marginal likelihood is equal to the prior mean of the conditional density of the data given the vector of parameters restricted to a certain subset of the parameter space, A, times the reciprocal of the posterior probability of the subset A. This identity motivates one to use Arithmetic Mean estimator based on simulation from the prior distribution restricted to any (but reasonable) subset of the space of parameters. By trimming this space, regions of relatively low likelihood are removed, and thereby the efficiency of the Arithmetic Mean estimator is improved. We show that the adjusted Arithmetic Mean estimator is unbiased and consistent.","Bayesian inference,Bayesian model selection,marginal likelihood","MONTE-CARLO METHODS,FINITE-MIXTURE-MODELS,NORMALIZING CONSTANTS,BAYES FACTORS,DENSITY-ESTIMATION,OUTPUT,DISTRIBUTIONS,DIFFICULTIES,SIMULATION,INFERENCE","Pajor, Anna@Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Econometr & Operat Res, Ul Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland","Pajor, Anna@Cracow University of Economics","Pajor, Anna@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5643-0649","A comparative study of Monte Carlo methods for efficient evaluation of marginal likelihood+Ardia, David; Basturk, Nalan; Hoogerheide, Lennart; et al.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+NOV 2012::Efficient Bayes factor estimation from the reversible jump output+Bartolucci, F; Scaccia, L; Mira, A+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 2006::A Bayesian approach to the selection and testing of mixture models+Berkhof, J; van Mechelen, I; Gelman, A+STATISTICA SINICA+APR 2003::BAYESIAN MODEL CHOICE VIA MARKOV-CHAIN MONTE-CARLO METHODS+CARLIN, BP; CHIB, S+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1995::Computational and inferential difficulties with mixture posterior distributions.+Celeux, G; Hurn, M; Robert, CP+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2000::IMPORTANCE-WEIGHTED MARGINAL BAYESIAN POSTERIOR DENSITY-ESTIMATION+CHEN, MH+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1994::Computing marginal likelihoods from a single MCMC output+Chen, MH+STATISTICA NEERLANDICA+FEB 2005::Marginal likelihood from the Metropolis-Hastings output+Chib, S; Jeliazkov, I+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2001::Marginal likelihood from the Gibbs output+Chib, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1995::Difficulties in drawing inferences with finite-mixture models: A simple example with a simple solution+Chung, H; Loken, E; Schafer, JL+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 2004::Marginal likelihood estimation via power posteriors+Friel, N.; Pettitt, A.

Adapting the ABC Distance Function,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA1002,MAR 2017,26,3,"Approximate Bayesian computation performs approximate inference for models where likelihood computations are expensive or impossible. Instead simulations from the model are performed for various parameter values and accepted if they are close enough to the observations. There has been much progress on deciding which summary statistics of the data should be used to judge closeness, but less work on how to weight them. Typically weights are chosen at the start of the algorithm which normalise the summary statistics to vary on similar scales. However these may not be appropriate in iterative ABC algorithms, where the distribution from which the parameters are proposed is updated. This can substantially alter the resulting distribution of summary statistics, so that different weights are needed for normalisation. This paper presents two iterative ABC algorithms which adaptively update their weights and demonstrates improved results on test applications.","likelihood-free inference,population Monte Carlo,quantile distributions,Lotka-Volterra","APPROXIMATE BAYESIAN COMPUTATION,DISTRIBUTIONS,EVOLUTION","Prangle, Dennis@Newcastle Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England","Prangle, Dennis@Newcastle University - UK",not exist,"Contribution to the discussion of Fearnhead and Prangle (2012)+Barnes, C.

A New Family of Non-Local Priors for Chain Event Graph Model Selection,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA981,DEC 2016,46,1,Chain Event Graphs ( CEGs) are a rich and provenly useful class of graphical models. The class contains discrete Bayesian Networks as a special case and is able to depict directly the asymmetric context-specific statements in the model. But bespoke efficient algorithms now need to be developed to search the enormous CEG model space. In different contexts Bayes Factor scored search algorithm using non-local priors ( NLPs) has recently proved very successful for searching other huge model spaces. Here we define and explore three different types of NLP that we customise to search CEG spaces. We demonstrate how one of these candidate NLPs provides a framework for search which is both robust and computationally efficient. It also avoids selecting an overfitting model as the standard conjugate methods sometimes do. We illustrate the efficacy of our methods with two examples. First we analyse a previously well-studied 5-year longitudinal study of childhood hospitalisation. The second much larger example selects between competing models of prisoners' radicalisation in British prisons: because of its size an application beyond the scope of earlier Bayes Factor search algorithms.,"chain event graph,Bayesian model selection,non-local prior,moment prior,discrete Bayesian networks,asymmetric discrete models,Bayes factor search","PROBABILISTIC DECISION GRAPHS,INDEPENDENCE,HYPOTHESIS,INFERENCE","Collazo, Rodrigo A.@Univ Warwick, Dept Stat, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England::Smith, Jim Q.@Univ Warwick, Dept Stat, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England","Collazo, Rodrigo A.@University of Warwick::Smith, Jim Q.@University of Warwick",not exist,"Handbook of mathematical functions with formulas, graphs, and mathematical tables+Abramowitz, M.; Stegun, I.

Bayesian Analysis of Continuous Time Markov Chains with Application to Phylogenetic Modelling,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA982,DEC 2016,88,1,"Bayesian analysis of continuous time, discrete state space time series is an important and challenging problem, where incomplete observation and large parameter sets call for user-defined priors based on known properties of the process. Generalized linear models have a largely unexplored potential to construct such prior distributions. We show that an important challenge with Bayesian generalized linear modelling of continuous time Markov chains is that classical Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques are too ineffective to be practical in that setup. We address this issue using an auxiliary variable construction combined with an adaptive Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm. This sampling algorithm and model make it efficient both in terms of computation and analyst's time to construct stochastic processes informed by prior knowledge, such as known properties of the states of the process. We demonstrate the flexibility and scalability of our framework using synthetic and real phylogenetic protein data, where a prior based on amino acid physicochemical properties is constructed to obtain accurate rate matrix estimates.","CTMCs,Bayesian GLMs rate matrix,MCMC,AHMC,uniformization,phylogenetic tree","AMINO-ACID SUBSTITUTION,HYBRID MONTE-CARLO,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD APPROACH,RUN LENGTH CONTROL,PROTEIN EVOLUTION,MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA,CODON MODEL,MATRIX,INFERENCE,SEQUENCES","Zhao, Tingting@Univ British Columbia, Dept Stat, Vancouver, BC V6T 1W5, Canada::Wang, Ziyu@Univ Oxford, Dept Comp Sci, Oxford, England::Cumberworth, Alexander@Univ British Columbia, Ctr High Throughput Biol, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Vancouver, BC, Canada::Gsponer, Joerg@Univ British Columbia, Ctr High Throughput Biol, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Vancouver, BC, Canada::de Freitas, Nando@Univ Oxford, Dept Comp Sci, Oxford, England::Bouchard-Cote, Alexandre@Univ British Columbia, Dept Stat, Vancouver, BC V6T 1W5, Canada","Zhao, Tingting@University of British Columbia::Wang, Ziyu@University of Oxford::Cumberworth, Alexander@University of British Columbia::Gsponer, Joerg@University of British Columbia::de Freitas, Nando@University of Oxford::Bouchard-Cote, Alexandre@University of British Columbia","Cumberworth, Alexander@A-4983-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8272-6360","Plastid genome phylogeny and a model of amino acid substitution for proteins encoded by chloroplast DNA+Adachi, J; Waddell, PJ; Martin, W; et al.+JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION+APR 2000::Model of amino acid substitution in proteins encoded by mitochondrial DNA+Adachi, J; Hasegawa, M+JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION+APR 1996::Probability distributions on cladograms+Aldous, D.

Bayesian Solution Uncertainty Quantification for Differential Equations,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA1017,DEC 2016,46,11,"We explore probability modelling of discretization uncertainty for system states defined implicitly by ordinary or partial differential equations. Accounting for this uncertainty can avoid posterior under-coverage when likelihoods are constructed from a coarsely discretized approximation to system equations. A formalism is proposed for inferring a fixed but a priori unknown model trajectory through Bayesian updating of a prior process conditional on model information. A one-step-ahead sampling scheme for interrogating the model is described, its consistency and first order convergence properties are proved, and its computational complexity is shown to be proportional to that of numerical explicit one-step solvers. Examples illustrate the flexibility of this framework to deal with a wide variety of complex and large-scale systems. Within the calibration problem, discretization uncertainty defines a layer in the Bayesian hierarchy, and a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that targets this posterior distribution is presented. This formalism is used for inference on the JAK-STAT delay differential equation model of protein dynamics from indirectly observed measurements. The discussion outlines implications for the new field of probabilistic numerics.","Bayesian numerical analysis,uncertainty quantification,Gaussian processes,differential equation models,uncertainty in computer models","CHAIN MONTE-CARLO,PARAMETER-ESTIMATION,INVERSE PROBLEMS,PROFILE LIKELIHOOD,MODEL-REDUCTION,SYSTEMS,IDENTIFICATION,TOMOGRAPHY,ERROR,ODES","Chkrebtii, Oksana A.@Ohio State Univ, Dept Stat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA::Campbell, David A.@Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Burnaby, BC, Canada::Calderhead, Ben@Imperial Coll London, Dept Math, London, England::Girolami, Mark A.@Univ Warwick, Dept Stat, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England","Chkrebtii, Oksana A.@Ohio State University::Campbell, David A.@Simon Fraser University::Calderhead, Ben@Imperial College London::Girolami, Mark A.@University of Warwick",not exist,"Approximation errors and model reduction with an application in optical diffusion tomography+Arridge, SR; Kaipio, JP; Kolehmainen, V; et al.+INVERSE PROBLEMS+FEB 2006::LIKELIHOOD AND BAYESIAN PREDICTION OF CHAOTIC SYSTEMS+BERLINER, LM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1991::Recent advances in parameter identification techniques for ODE+Bock, H.

Bayes Factors for Smoothing Spline ANOVA,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA974,DEC 2016,44,0,"This paper describes an approach for variable selection and hypothesis testing in semiparametric additive models using Bayes factors in smoothing spline analysis of variance (SSANOVA) models. Effects can be linear or nonparametric (i.e., smooth or interactions between selected linear and smooth effects). To evaluate the importance of each term in the model, we develop Bayes factors for both linear and nonparametric terms. We compute approximate Bayes factors by Monte Carlo and Laplace integration. These Bayes factors can be computed to compare any two sub-models including one model nested in another. This permits formal tests of any portion or simultaneous portions of an SSANOVA model. We demonstrate this approach with an example.","smoothing spline ANOVA,Bayes factor,laplace integration,reproducing kernel,semiparametric model","LINEAR MIXED MODELS,VARIABLE SELECTION,LIKELIHOOD RATIO,VARIANCE,HYPOTHESIS,INFERENCE","Cheng, Chin-I.@Cent Michigan Univ, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA::Speckman, Paul L.@Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Cheng, Chin-I.@Central Michigan University::Speckman, Paul L.@University of Missouri Columbia@University of Missouri System",not exist,"Marginal likelihood and Bayes factors for Dirichlet process mixture models+Basu, S; Chib, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2003::no title+Bowman,, A.W.; Azzalini,, A.+Applied Smoothing Techniques for Data Analysis: The Kernel Approach with S-Plus Illustrations+1997::Bayesian smoothing spline analysis of variance+Cheng, Chin-I; Speckman, Paul L.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+DEC 2012::Semiparametric Modeling and Estimation of Instrumental Variable Models+Chib, S.; Greenberg, E.+Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics+2007::Inference in semiparametric dynamic models for binary longitudinal data+Chib, S; Jeliazkov, I+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2006::Additive cubic spline regression with Dirichlet process mixture errors+Chib, Siddhartha; Greenberg, Edward+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUN 2010::TESTING THE (PARAMETRIC) NULL MODEL HYPOTHESIS IN (SEMIPARAMETRIC) PARTIAL AND GENERALIZED SPLINE MODELS+COX, D; KOH, E; WAHBA, G; et al.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+MAR 1988::Likelihood ratio tests in linear mixed models with one variance component+Crainiceanu, CM; Ruppert, D+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2004::WEIGHTED LIKELIHOOD RATIO, LINEAR HYPOTHESES ON NORMAL LOCATION PARAMETERS+DICKEY, JM+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1971::Testing for additivity in nonparametric regression+Eubank, RL; Hart, JD; Simpson, DG; et al.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1995::Generalized likelihood ratio statistics and Wilks phenomenon+Fan, JQ; Zhang, CM; Zhang, J+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 2001::Nonparametric inferences for additive models+Fan, JQ; Jiang, JC+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2005::no title+GELMAN, A.; CARLIN, J.

Bayesian Lattice Filters for Time-Varying Autoregression and Time-Frequency Analysis,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA978,DEC 2016,35,1,"Modeling nonstationary processes is of paramount importance to many scientific disciplines including environmental science, ecology, and finance, among others. Consequently, flexible methodology that provides accurate estimation across a wide range of processes is a subject of ongoing interest. We propose a novel approach to model-based time-frequency estimation using time-varying autoregressive models. In this context, we take a fully Bayesian approach and allow both the autoregressive coefficients and innovation variance to vary over time. Importantly, our estimation method uses the lattice filter and is cast within the partial autocorrelation domain. The marginal posterior distributions are of standard form and, as a convenient by-product of our estimation method, our approach avoids undesirable matrix inversions. As such, estimation is extremely computationally efficient and stable. To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct a comprehensive simulation study that compares our method with other competing methods and find that, in most cases, our approach performs superior in terms of average squared error between the estimated and true time-varying spectral density. Lastly, we demonstrate our methodology through three modeling applications; namely, insect communication signals, environmental data (wind components), and macroeconomic data (US gross domestic product (GDP) and consumption).","locally stationary,model selection,nonstationary,partial autocorrelation,piecewise stationary,sequential estimation,time-varying spectral density","SERIES,MODELS,COMMUNICATION","Yang, Wen-Hsi@CSIRO Computat Informat, Ecosci Precinct, GPO Box 2583, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia::Holan, Scott H.@Univ Missouri, Dept Stat, 146 Middlebush Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA::Wikle, Christopher K.@Univ Missouri, Dept Stat, 146 Middlebush Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Yang, Wen-Hsi@Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)::Holan, Scott H.@University of Missouri Columbia@University of Missouri System::Wikle, Christopher K.@University of Missouri Columbia@University of Missouri System","Yang, Wen-Hsi@K-7188-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8236-0082","Vibratory communication in treehoppers (Hemiptera : membracidae)+Cocroft, Reginald B.; McNett, Gabriel D.+INSECT SOUNDS AND COMMUNICATION: PHYSIOLOGY, BEHAVIOUR, ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION+2006::no title+CRESSIE, N.; WIKLE, C.

Context-Dependent Score Based Bayesian Information Criteria,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA980,DEC 2016,36,0,"In a number of applications, we argue that standard Bayes factor model comparison and selection may be inappropriate for decision making under specific, utility-based, criteria. It has been suggested that the use of scoring rules in this context allows greater flexibility: scores can be customised to a client's utility and model selection can proceed on the basis of the highest scoring model. We argue here that the approach of comparing the cumulative scores of competing models is not ideal because it tends to ignore a model's ability to 'catch up' through parameter learning. An alternative approach of selecting a model on its maximum posterior score based on a plug in or posterior expected value is problematic in that it uses the data twice in estimation and evaluation. We therefore introduce a new Bayesian posterior score information criterion (BPSIC), which is a generalisation of the Bayesian predictive information criterion proposed by Ando (2007). This allows the analyst both to tailor an appropriate scoring function to the needs of the ultimate decision maker and to correct appropriately for bias in using the data on a posterior basis to revise parameter estimates. We show that this criterion can provide a convenient method of initial model comparison when the number of models under consideration is large or when computational burdens are high. We illustrate the new methods with simulated examples and real data from the UK electricity imbalance market.","scoring rules,Bayesian model selection,information criteria,utility based model selection","MODEL,CHOICE,DISTRIBUTIONS,RULES","Underhill, N.

Spatial Panel Data Model with Error Dependence: A Bayesian Separable Covariance Approach,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA979,DEC 2016,42,1,"A hierarchical Bayesian model for spatial panel data is proposed. The idea behind the proposed method is to analyze spatially dependent panel data by means of a separable covariance matrix. Let us indicate the observations as y(it), in i = 1,..., N regions and at t = 1,..., T times, and suppose the covariance matrix of y, given a set of regressors, is written as a Kronecker product of a purely spatial and a purely temporal covariance. On the one hand, the structure of separable covariances dramatically reduces the number of parameters, while on the other hand, the lack of a structured pattern for spatial and temporal covariances permits capturing possible unknown dependencies (both in time and space). The use of the Bayesian approach allows one to overcome some of the difficulties of the classical (MLE or GMM based) approach. We present two illustrative examples: the estimation of cigarette price elasticity and of the determinants of the house price in 120 municipalities in the Province of Rome.","Bayesian inference,Kronecker product,separable covariance matrix,inverse Wishart distribution,spatial-temporal dependence","MATRIX,LIKELIHOOD,COMPONENTS","Leorato, Samantha@Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Econ & Finance, Rome, Italy::Mezzetti, Maura@Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Econ & Finance, Rome, Italy","Leorato, Samantha@University of Rome Tor Vergata::Mezzetti, Maura@University of Rome Tor Vergata","MEZZETTI, MAURA@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8214-7000","Spatial Panel Econometrics+Anselin, L.; Gallo, J.L.; Jayet, H.+Adv.

Scale-Dependent Priors for Variance Parameters in Structured Additive Distributional Regression,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA983,DEC 2016,50,8,"The selection of appropriate hyperpriors for variance parameters is an important and sensible topic in all kinds of Bayesian regression models involving the specification of (conditionally) Gaussian prior structures where the variance parameters determine a data-driven, adaptive amount of prior variability or precision. We consider the special case of structured additive distributional regression where Gaussian priors are used to enforce specific properties such as smoothness or shrinkage on various effect types combined in predictors for multiple parameters related to the distribution of the response. Relying on a recently proposed class of penalised complexity priors motivated from a general set of construction principles, we derive a hyperprior structure where prior elicitation is facilitated by assumptions on the scaling of the different effect types. The posterior distribution is assessed with an adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme and conditions for its propriety are studied theoretically. We investigate the new type of scale-dependent priors in simulations and two challenging applications, in particular in comparison to the standard inverse gamma priors but also alternatives such as half-normal, half-Cauchy and proper uniform priors for standard deviations.","Kullback-Leibler divergence,Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations,penalised complexity prior,penalised splines,propriety of the posterior","MARKOV RANDOM-FIELDS,LINEAR MIXED MODELS,BAYESIAN P-SPLINES,VARIABLE SELECTION,OBJECTIVE PRIORS,POSTERIORS,INFERENCE,PROPRIETY,SPIKE","Klein, Nadja@Univ Gottingen, Chair Stat, Gottingen, Germany::Kneib, Thomas@Univ Gottingen, Chair Stat, Gottingen, Germany","Klein, Nadja@University of Gottingen::Kneib, Thomas@University of Gottingen",not exist,"Generalization of Jeffreys divergence-based priors for Bayesian hypothesis testing+Bayarri, M.

Equivariant and Scale-Free Tucker Decomposition Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/14-BA934,SEP 2016,23,2,"Analyses of array-valued datasets often involve reduced-rank array approximations, typically obtained via least-squares or truncations of array decompositions. However, least-squares approximations tend to be noisy in high-dimensional settings, and may not be appropriate for arrays that include discrete or ordinal measurements. This article develops methodology to obtain low-rank model-based representations of continuous, discrete and ordinal data arrays. The model is based on a parameterization of the mean array as a multilinear product of a reduced-rank core array and a set of index-specific orthogonal eigenvector matrices. It is shown how orthogonally equivariant parameter estimates can be obtained from Bayesian procedures under invariant prior distributions. Additionally, priors on the core array are developed that act as regularizers, leading to improved inference over the standard least-squares estimator, and providing robustness to misspecification of the array rank. This model-based approach is extended to accommodate discrete or ordinal data arrays using a semiparametric transformation model.

Smoothing and Mean-Covariance Estimation of Functional Data with a Bayesian Hierarchical Model,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA967,SEP 2016,33,5,"Functional data, with basic observational units being functions (e.g., curves, surfaces) varying over a continuum, are frequently encountered in various applications. While many statistical tools have been developed for functional data analysis, the issue of smoothing all functional observations simultaneously is less studied. Existing methods often focus on smoothing each individual function separately, at the risk of removing important systematic patterns common across functions. We propose a nonparametric Bayesian approach to smooth all functional observations simultaneously and nonparametrically. In the proposed approach, we assume that the functional observations are independent Gaussian processes subject to a common level of measurement errors, enabling the borrowing of strength across all observations. Unlike most Gaussian process regression models that rely on pre-specified structures for the covariance kernel, we adopt a hierarchical framework by assuming a Gaussian process prior for the mean function and an Inverse-Wishart process prior for the covariance function. These prior assumptions induce an automatic mean-covariance estimation in the posterior inference in addition to the simultaneous smoothing of all observations. Such a hierarchical framework is flexible enough to incorporate functional data with different characteristics, including data measured on either common or uncommon grids, and data with either stationary or nonstationary covariance structures. Simulations and real data analysis demonstrate that, in comparison with alternative methods, the proposed Bayesian approach achieves better smoothing accuracy and comparable mean-covariance estimation results. Furthermore, it can successfully retain the systematic patterns in the functional observations that are usually neglected by the existing functional data analyses based on individual-curve smoothing.","functional data,smoothing,Bayesian hierarchical model,Gaussian process,Matern covariance function,empirical Bayes","GAUSSIAN PROCESS REGRESSION,LONGITUDINAL DATA,CLASSIFICATION,VARIANCE","Yang, Jingjing@Univ Michigan, Dept Biostat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA::Zhu, Hongxiao@Virginia Tech, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Choi, Taeryon@Korea Univ, Dept Stat, Seoul 136701, South Korea::Cox, Dennis D.@Rice Univ, Dept Stat, Houston, TX 77005 USA","Yang, Jingjing@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan::Zhu, Hongxiao@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Choi, Taeryon@Korea University::Cox, Dennis D.@Rice University","Yang, Jingjing@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4191-4138","Efficient Gaussian process regression for large datasets+Banerjee, Anjishnu; Dunson, David B.; Tokdar, Surya T.+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 2013::no title+Banerjee, S.; Carlin, B.

We also study the notion of Bayesian A-optimality in the infinite-dimensional setting, and extend the well known (in the finite-dimensional case) equivalence of the Bayes risk of the MAP estimator with the trace of the posterior covariance, for the Gaussian linear case, to the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space case.","Bayesian inference in Hilbert space,Gaussian measure,Kullback-Leibler divergence,Bayesian optimal experimental design,expected information gain,Bayes risk",INVERSE PROBLEMS,"Alexanderian, Alen@Univ Texas Austin, Inst Computat Engn & Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA@North Carolina State Univ, Dept Math, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA::Gloor, Philip J.@US Naval Acad, Dept Math, Annapolis, MD 21402 USA::Ghattas, Omar@Univ Texas Austin, Inst Computat Engn & Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA@Univ Texas Austin, Dept Geol Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA@Univ Texas Austin, Dept Mech Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Alexanderian, Alen@University of Texas Austin@North Carolina State University@University of Texas System@University of North Carolina::Gloor, Philip J.@United States Navy@United States Naval Academy@United States Department of Defense::Ghattas, Omar@University of Texas Austin@University of Texas System",not exist,"A-OPTIMAL DESIGN OF EXPERIMENTS FOR INFINITE-DIMENSIONAL BAYESIAN LINEAR INVERSE PROBLEMS WITH REGULARIZED l(0)-SPARSIFICATION+Alexanderian, Alen; Petra, Noemi; Stadler, Georg; et al.+SIAM JOURNAL ON SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING+2014::no title+Atkinson, A.

Many of their distributional properties are known by now but their stick-breaking representation is missing. Here we display such a representation, which will feature dependent stick-breaking weights, and then derive explicit versions for noteworthy special cases of hNRMI. Posterior characterizations are also discussed. Finally, we devise an algorithm for slice sampling mixture models based on hNRMIs, which relies on the representation we have obtained, and implement it to analyze real data.","Bayesian Nonparametrics,generalized Dirichlet process,normalized generalized gamma process,normalized random measures with independent increments,normalized stable process,normalized inverse-Gaussian process,random probability measure,stick-breaking representation","RANDOM DISCRETE-DISTRIBUTIONS,INVERSE-GAUSSIAN PRIORS,DIRICHLET PROCESS,MODELS,COMPONENTS","Favaro, S.@Univ Turin, I-10124 Turin, Italy@Coll Carlo Alberto, Moncalieri, TO, Italy::Lijoi, A.@Coll Carlo Alberto, Moncalieri, TO, Italy@Univ Pavia, I-27100 Pavia, Italy::Nava, C.@Univ Turin, I-10124 Turin, Italy@Coll Carlo Alberto, Moncalieri, TO, Italy::Nipoti, B.@Univ Turin, I-10124 Turin, Italy@Coll Carlo Alberto, Moncalieri, TO, Italy::Prunster, I.@Univ Turin, I-10124 Turin, Italy@Coll Carlo Alberto, Moncalieri, TO, Italy::Teh, Y.

From Statistical Evidence to Evidence of Causality,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA968,SEP 2016,45,10,"While statisticians and quantitative social scientists typically study the ""effects of causes"" (EoC), Lawyers and the Courts are more concerned with understanding the ""causes of effects"" (CoE). EoC can be addressed using experimental design and statistical analysis, but it is less clear how to incorporate statistical or epidemiological evidence into CoE reasoning, as might be required for a case at Law. Some form of counterfactual reasoning, such as the ""potential outcomes"" approach championed by Rubin, appears unavoidable, but this typically yields ""answers"" that are sensitive to arbitrary and untestable assumptions. We must therefore recognise that a CoE question simply might not have a well-determined answer. It is nevertheless possible to use statistical data to set bounds within which any answer must lie. With less than perfect data these bounds will themselves be uncertain, leading to a compounding of different kinds of uncertainty. Still further care is required in the presence of possible confounding factors. In addition, even identifying the relevant ""counterfactual contrast"" may be a matter of Policy as much as of Science. Defining the question is as non-trivial a task as finding a route towards an answer.

This paper develops some technical elaborations of these philosophical points from a personalist Bayesian perspective, and illustrates them with a Bayesian analysis of a case study in child protection.","benfluorex,causes of effects,counterfactual,child protection,effects of causes,Frechet bound,potential outcome,probability of causation","MODELS,BENFLUOREX,CAUSATION,INFERENCE","Dawid, A.

Asymptotic Properties of Bayes Risk of a General Class of Shrinkage Priors in Multiple Hypothesis Testing Under Sparsity,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA973,SEP 2016,37,6,"Consider the problem of simultaneous testing for the means of independent normal observations. In this paper, we study some asymptotic optimality properties of certain multiple testing rules induced by a general class of one-group shrinkage priors in a Bayesian decision theoretic framework, where the overall loss is taken as the number of misclassified hypotheses. We assume a two-groups normal mixture model for the data and consider the asymptotic framework adopted in Bogdan et al. (2011) who introduced the notion of asymptotic Bayes optimality under sparsity in the context of multiple testing. The general class of one-group priors under study is rich enough to include, among others, the families of three parameter beta, generalized double Pareto priors, and in particular the horseshoe, the normal-exponential-gamma and the Strawderman-Berger priors. We establish that within our chosen asymptotic framework, the multiple testing rules under study asymptotically attain the risk of the Bayes Oracle up to a multiplicative factor, with the constant in the risk close to the constant in the Oracle risk. This is similar to a result obtained in Datta and Ghosh (2013) for the multiple testing rule based on the horseshoe estimator introduced in Carvalho et al. (2009, 2010). We further show that under very mild assumption on the underlying sparsity parameter, the induced decisions using an empirical Bayes estimate of the corresponding global shrinkage parameter proposed by van der Pas et al. (2014), asymptotically attain the optimal Bayes risk up to the same multiplicative factor. We provide a unifying argument applicable for the general class of priors under study. In the process, we settle a conjecture regarding optimality property of the generalized double Pareto priors made in Datta and Ghosh (2013). Our work also shows that the result in Datta and Ghosh (2013) can be improved further.","asymptotic optimality,Bayes Oracle,empirical Bayes,generalized double Pareto,three parameter beta,horseshoe,normal-exponential-gamma,Strawderman-Berger","HORSESHOE ESTIMATOR,PRIOR DISTRIBUTIONS,REGRESSION,PROPORTION,SELECTION,MIXTURES","Ghosh, Prasenjit@Indian Stat Inst, Appl Stat Unit, 203 BT Rd, Kolkata 700108, India::Tang, Xueying@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, POB 118545, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA::Ghosh, Malay@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, POB 118545, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA::Chakrabarti, Arijit@Indian Stat Inst, Appl Stat Unit, 203 BT Rd, Kolkata 700108, India","Ghosh, Prasenjit@Indian Statistical Institute@Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata::Tang, Xueying@State University System of Florida@University of Florida::Ghosh, Malay@State University System of Florida@University of Florida::Chakrabarti, Arijit@Indian Statistical Institute@Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata",not exist,"Generalized Beta Mixtures of Gaussians.+Armagan, Artin; Dunson, David B; Clyde, Merlise+Advances in neural information processing systems+2011::GENERALIZED DOUBLE PARETO SHRINKAGE+Armagan, Artin; Dunson, David B.; Lee, Jaeyong+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 2013::CONTROLLING THE FALSE DISCOVERY RATE - A PRACTICAL AND POWERFUL APPROACH TO MULTIPLE TESTING+BENJAMINI, Y; HOCHBERG, Y+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1995::Bayesian Shrinkage+Bhattacharya, A.; Pati, D.; Pillai, N.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Dunson, D.

Multivariate Stochastic Process Models for Correlated Responses of Mixed Type,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA976,SEP 2016,49,1,"We propose a new model for correlated outputs of mixed type, such as continuous and binary outputs, with a particular focus on joint regression and classification, motivated by an application in constrained optimization for computer simulation modeling. Our framework is based upon multivariate stochastic processes, extending Gaussian process methodology for modeling of continuous multivariate spatial outputs by adding a latent process structure that allows for joint modeling of a variety of types of correlated outputs. In addition, we implement fully Bayesian inference using particle learning, which allows us to conduct fast sequential inference. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods on both synthetic examples and a real world hydrology computer experiment optimization problem where it is helpful to model the black box objective function as correlated with satisfaction of the constraint.","Gaussian process,particle learning,Bayesian statistics,constrained optimization,computer simulation experiment","GAUSSIAN PROCESS MODELS,OPTIMIZATION,EMULATION,DESIGN","Pourmohamad, Tony@Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Baskin Sch Engn, Dept Appl Math & Stat, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA::Lee, Herbert K.

Bayesian Quantile Regression Based on the Empirical Likelihood with Spike and Slab Priors,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA975,SEP 2016,48,2,"In this paper, we consider nonparametric Bayesian variable selection in quantile regression. The Bayesian model is based on the empirical likelihood, and the prior is chosen as the ""spike-and-slab"" prior-a mixture of a point mass at zero and a normal distribution. We show that the posterior distribution of the zero coefficients converges to a point mass at zero and that of the nonzero coefficients converges to a normal distribution. To further address the problem of low statistical efficiency in extreme quantile regression, we extend the Bayesian model such that it can integrate information at multiple quantiles to provide more accurate inference of extreme quantiles for homogenous error models. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform or perform equally well compared with existing methods. We apply this Bayesian method to study the role of microRNAs on regulating gene expression and find that the regulation of microRNA may have a positive effect on the gene expression variation.","model selection,Gibbs sampler,oracle property,empirical process,consistency","VARIABLE SELECTION,CANALIZATION,MICRORNAS","Xi, Ruibin@Peking Univ, Sch Math Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China@Peking Univ, Ctr Stat Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China::Li, Yunxiao@Emory Univ, Dept Biostat & Bioinformat, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA::Hu, Yiming@Yale Univ, Dept Biostat, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Xi, Ruibin@Peking University::Li, Yunxiao@Emory University::Hu, Yiming@Yale University",not exist,"The Case for Objective Bayesian Analysis+Berger, James+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2006::Choice of hierarchical priors: Admissibility in estimation of normal means+Berger, JO; Strawderman, WE+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 1996::CHANGES IN THE UNITED-STATES WAGE STRUCTURE 1963-1987 - APPLICATION OF QUANTILE REGRESSION+BUCHINSKY, M+ECONOMETRICA+MAR 1994::Adjusted empirical likelihood and its properties+Chen, Jiahua; Variyath, Asokan Mulayath; Abraham, Bovas+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+JUN 2008::SMOOTHED BLOCK EMPIRICAL LIKELIHOOD FOR QUANTILES OF WEAKLY DEPENDENT PROCESSES+Chen, Song Xi; Wong, Chiu Min+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 2009::A review on empirical likelihood methods for regression+Chen, Song Xi; Van Keilegom, Ingrid+TEST+NOV 2009::SMOOTHED EMPIRICAL LIKELIHOOD CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS FOR QUANTILES+CHEN, SX; HALL, P+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+SEP 1993::Variable selection via nonconcave penalized likelihood and its oracle properties+Fan, JQ; Li, RZ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2001::Identifying Risk Factors for Severe Childhood Malnutrition by Boosting Additive Quantile Regression+Fenske, Nora; Kneib, Thomas; Hothorn, Torsten+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2011::VARIABLE SELECTION VIA GIBBS SAMPLING+GEORGE, EI; MCCULLOCH, RE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1993::Canalization of development by microRNAs+Hornstein, Eran; Shomron, Noam+NATURE GENETICS+JUN 2006::Heterogeneous effect of gestational weight gain on birth weight: quantile regression analysis from a population-based screening+Hulman, Adam; Witte, Daniel R.; Kerenyi, Zsuzsa; et al.+ANNALS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+FEB 2015::Spike and slab variable selection: Frequentist and Bayesian strategies+Ishwaran, H; Rao, JS+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2005::Consistency of spike and slab regression+Ishwaran, Hemant; Rao, J.

Optimal Bayesian Experimental Design for Models with Intractable Likelihoods Using Indirect Inference Applied to Biological Process Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA977,SEP 2016,37,1,"This paper addresses the problem of determining optimal designs for biological process models with intractable likelihoods, with the goal of parameter inference. The Bayesian approach is to choose a design that maximises the mean of a utility, and the utility is a function of the posterior distribution. Therefore, its estimation requires likelihood evaluations. However, many problems in experimental design involve models with intractable likelihoods, that is, likelihoods that are neither analytic nor can be computed in a reasonable amount of time. We propose a novel solution using indirect inference (II), a well established method in the literature, and the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm of Muller et al. (2004). Indirect inference employs an auxiliary model with a tractable likelihood in conjunction with the generative model, the assumed true model of interest, which has an intractable likelihood. Our approach is to estimate a map between the parameters of the generative and auxiliary models, using simulations from the generative model. An II posterior distribution is formed to expedite utility estimation. We also present a modification to the utility that allows the Muller algorithm to sample from a substantially sharpened utility surface, with little computational effort. Unlike competing methods, the II approach can handle complex design problems for models with intractable likelihoods on a continuous design space, with possible extension to many observations. The methodology is demonstrated using two stochastic models; a simple tractable death process used to validate the approach, and a motivating stochastic model for the population evolution of macroparasites.","approximate Bayesian computation,auxiliary model,Bayesian experimental design,indirect inference,Markov chain Monte Carlo,Markov processes","LYMPHATIC FILARIASIS,BRUGIA-PAHANGI,TIMES,COMPUTATION,SIMULATION,NUMBER","Ryan, Caitriona M.@Queensland Univ Technol, Math Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia::Drovandi, Christopher C.@Queensland Univ Technol, Math Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia@ARC Ctr Excellence Math & Stat Frontiers ACEMS, Parkville, Vic, Australia::Pettitt, Anthony N.@Queensland Univ Technol, Math Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia@ARC Ctr Excellence Math & Stat Frontiers ACEMS, Parkville, Vic, Australia","Ryan, Caitriona M.@Queensland University of Technology (QUT)::Drovandi, Christopher C.@Queensland University of Technology (QUT)::Pettitt, Anthony N.@Queensland University of Technology (QUT)","Drovandi, Christopher@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9222-8763::Pettitt, Anthony@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4816-4595","A framework for validation of computer models+Bayarri, Maria J.; Berger, James O.; Paulo, Rui; et al.+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 2007::no title+Bernardo, J.; Smith, A.+Bayesian Theory+2000::OPTIMAL BAYESIAN DESIGN APPLIED TO LOGISTIC-REGRESSION EXPERIMENTS+CHALONER, K; LARNTZ, K+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+FEB 1989::Bayesian experimental design: A review+Chaloner, K; Verdinelli, I+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+AUG 1995::Experimental design: a Bayesian perspective+Clyde, MA.+Int Encycl Soc Behav Sci+2001::Optimal observation times in experimental epidemic processes+Cook, Alex R.; Gibson, Gavin J.; Gilligan, Christopher A.+BIOMETRICS+SEP 2008::Tests of separate families of hypotheses+Cox, D.+P 4 BERK S MATH STAT+1961::Studies with Brugia pahangi.

Efficient Metropolis-Hastings Proposal Mechanisms for Bayesian Regression Tree Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/16-BA999,SEP 2016,22,4,"Bayesian regression trees are flexible non-parametric models that are well suited to many modern statistical regression problems. Many such tree models have been proposed, from the simple single-tree model to more complex tree ensembles. Their nonparametric formulation allows one to model datasets exhibiting complex non-linear relationships between the model predictors and observations. However, the mixing behavior of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler is sometimes poor, frequently suffering from local mode stickiness and poor mixing. This is because existing Metropolis-Hastings proposals do not allow for efficient traversal of the model space. We develop novel Metropolis-Hastings proposals that account for the topological structure of regression trees. The first is a novel tree rotation proposal that only requires local changes to the regression tree structure, yet efficiently traverses disparate regions of the model space along contours of high likelihood. The second is a rule perturbation proposal which can be seen as an efficient variation of the change proposal found in existing literature. We implement these samplers and demonstrate their effectiveness on a prediction problem from computer experiments, a test function where structural tree variability is needed to fully explore the posterior and data from a heart rate study.","Markov chain Monte Carlo,proposal distribution,computer experiments,uncertainty quantification,credible interval,coverage probability","CART,BART","Pratola, Matthew T.@Ohio State Univ, Dept Stat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Pratola, Matthew T.@Ohio State University",not exist,"VARIABLE SELECTION FOR BART: AN APPLICATION TO GENE REGULATION+Bleich, Justin; Kapelner, Adam; George, Edward I.; et al.+ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS+SEP 2014::Bayesian CART model search+Chipman, HA; George, EI; McCulloch, RE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1998::Bayesian treed models+Chipman, HA; George, EI; McCulloch, RE+MACHINE LEARNING+JUL-SEP 2002::BART: BAYESIAN ADDITIVE REGRESSION TREES+Chipman, Hugh A.; George, Edward I.; McCulloch, Robert E.+ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS+MAR 2010::A Bayesian CART algorithm+Denison, DGT; Mallick, BK; Smith, AFM+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1998::MULTIVARIATE ADAPTIVE REGRESSION SPLINES+FRIEDMAN, JH+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+MAR 1991::Evaluating the accuracy of sampling-based approaches to calculating posterior moments+Geweke, J.+Bayesian statistics+1992::Bayesian Treed Gaussian Process Models With an Application to Computer Modeling+Gramacy, Robert B.; Lee, Herbert K.

Here we discuss two considerations: the first is the use of the new proposal mechanism within a population Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler (Geyer, 1991) to further increase sampling efficiency in the presence of greatly separated posterior modes, the second is a prior model that favors parsimony for the problem of variable selection.","population Markov chain Monte Carlo,model selection,Bayesian treed regression",,"Chkrebtii, Oksana A.@Ohio State Univ, Dept Stat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Chkrebtii, Oksana A.@Ohio State University","Kaptein, Maurits@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6316-7524::Martino, Luca@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7611-6558","BART: BAYESIAN ADDITIVE REGRESSION TREES+Chipman, Hugh A.; George, Edward I.; McCulloch, Robert E.+ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS+MAR 2010::Markov Chain Monte Carlo Maximum Likelihood+Geyer, C.

In a divide and conquer strategy, LISA partitions the dataset into different ""batches"" and runs Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods on each batch of data independently using different processors. The results from all processors are then combined. In this discussion paper, we examine the performance of LISA when applied to the Bayesian Regression Trees model with tree proposals introduced by Pratola (2016). Our results show that LISA yields empirical distribution functions which are indistinguishable from those obtained using Pratola's algorithm, even though it first divides the data into K batches and can thus be used with datasets which are too large to fit into a single machine's memory.","Bayesian Regression Trees (BART),big data,communication-free,Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)",,"Entezari, Reihaneh@Univ Toronto, Dept Stat Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada::Craiu, Radu V.@Univ Toronto, Dept Stat Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada::Rosenthal, Jeffrey S.@Univ Toronto, Dept Stat Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada","Entezari, Reihaneh@University of Toronto::Craiu, Radu V.@University of Toronto::Rosenthal, Jeffrey S.@University of Toronto",not exist,"Bayesian CART model search+Chipman, HA; George, EI; McCulloch, RE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1998::BART: BAYESIAN ADDITIVE REGRESSION TREES+Chipman, Hugh A.; George, Edward I.; McCulloch, Robert E.+ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS+MAR 2010::Likelihood Inflating Sampling Algorithm+Entezari, R.; Craiu, R.

Posterior Contraction Rates of the Phylogenetic Indian Buffet Processes,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA958,JUN 2016,37,0,"By expressing prior distributions as general stochastic processes, nonparametric Bayesian methods provide a flexible way to incorporate prior knowledge and constrain the latent structure in statistical inference. The Indian buffet process (IBP) is such an example that can be used to define a prior distribution on infinite binary features, where the exchangeability among subjects is assumed. The phylogenetic Indian buffet process (pIBP), a derivative of IBP, enables the modeling of non-exchangeability among subjects through a stochastic process on a rooted tree, which is similar to that used in phylogenetics, to describe relationships among the subjects. In this paper, we study the theoretical properties of IBP and pIBP under a binary factor model. We establish the posterior contraction rates for both IBP and pIBP and substantiate the theoretical results through simulation studies. This is the first work addressing the frequentist property of the posterior behaviors of IBP and pIBP. We also demonstrated its practical usefulness by applying pIBP prior to a real data example arising in the field of cancer genomics where the exchangeability among subjects is violated.","Bayesian nonparametrics,Indian buffet process,latent factor analysis,cancer genomics","COVARIANCE-MATRIX ESTIMATION,BREAST-CANCER,FACTOR MODELS,SPARSE PCA,GENE,DISTRIBUTIONS,CONSISTENCY,INTERACTS,GENOMICS,GROWTH","Chen, Mengjie@Univ N Carolina, Dept Biostat, Chapel Hill, NC 27516 USA::Gao, Chao@Yale Univ, Dept Stat, New Haven, CT 06511 USA::Zhao, Hongyu@Yale Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Chen, Mengjie@University of North Carolina Chapel Hill@University of North Carolina::Gao, Chao@Yale University::Zhao, Hongyu@Yale University",not exist,"Genomic analysis of the HER2/TOP2A amplicon in breast cancer and breast cancer cell lines+Arriola, Edurne; Marchio, Caterina; Tan, David Sp; et al.+LABORATORY INVESTIGATION+MAY 2008::The consistency of posterior distributions in nonparametric problems+Barron, A; Schervish, MJ; Wasserman, L+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 1999::Integrated genomic analyses of ovarian carcinoma+Bell, D.; Berchuck, A.; Birrer, M.; et al.+NATURE+JUN 30 2011::MINIMAX BOUNDS FOR SPARSE PCA WITH NOISY HIGH-DIMENSIONAL DATA+Birnbaum, Aharon; Johnstone, Iain M.; Nadler, Boaz; et al.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2013::SPARSE PCA: OPTIMAL RATES AND ADAPTIVE ESTIMATION+Cai, T.

Pre-surgical fMRI Data Analysis Using a Spatially Adaptive Conditionally Autoregressive Model,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA972,JUN 2016,49,1,"Spatial smoothing is an essential step in the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. One standard smoothing method is to convolve the image data with a three-dimensional Gaussian kernel that applies a fixed amount of smoothing to the entire image. In pre-surgical brain image analysis where spatial accuracy is paramount, this method, however, is not reasonable as it can blur the boundaries between activated and deactivated regions of the brain. Moreover, while in a standard fMRI analysis strict false positive control is desired, for pre-surgical planning false negatives are of greater concern. To this end, we propose a novel spatially adaptive conditionally autoregressive model with variances in the full conditional of the means that are proportional to error variances, allowing the degree of smoothing to vary across the brain. Additionally, we present a new loss function that allows for the asymmetric treatment of false positives and false negatives. We compare our proposed model with two existing spatially adaptive conditionally autoregressive models. Simulation studies show that our model outperforms these other models; as a real model application, we apply the proposed model to the pre-surgical fMRI data of two patients to assess peri-and intra-tumoral brain activity.","fMRI analysis,spatially adaptive CAR models,loss function,pre-surgical mapping","BLOOD OXYGENATION,SENSORY STIMULATION,FUNCTIONAL MRI,IMAGES,TUMOR","Liu, Zhuqing@Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA::Berrocal, Veronica J.@Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA::Bartsch, Andreas J.@Heidelberg Univ, Dept Neuroradiol, Neuenheimer Feld 400, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany@Univ Wurzburg, Dept Neuroradiol, Joseph Schneider Str 11, D-97080 Wurzburg, Germany@Univ Oxford, Dept Clin Neurol, FMRIB Ctr, Oxford, England::Johnson, Timothy D.@Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Liu, Zhuqing@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan::Berrocal, Veronica J.@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan::Bartsch, Andreas J.@University of Oxford@Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg@University of Wurzburg::Johnson, Timothy D.@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan",not exist,"Presurgical tractography applications+Bartsch, A.

Flexible Bayesian Survival Modeling with Semiparametric Time-Dependent and Shape-Restricted Covariate Effects,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA954,JUN 2016,27,1,"Presently, there are few options with available software to perform a fully Bayesian analysis of time-to-event data wherein the hazard is estimated semi-or non-parametrically. One option is the piecewise exponential model, which requires an often unrealistic assumption that the hazard is piecewise constant over time. The primary aim of this paper is to construct a tractable semiparametric alternative to the piecewise exponential model that assumes the hazard is continuous, and to provide modifiable, user-friendly software that allows the use of these methods in a variety of settings. To accomplish this aim, we use a novel model formulation for the log-hazard based on a low-rank thin plate linear spline that readily facilitates adjustment for covariates with time-dependent and proportional hazards effects, possibly subject to shape restrictions. We investigate the performance of our model choices via simulation. We then analyze colorectal cancer data from a clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of two novel treatment regimes relative to the standard of care for overall survival. We estimate a time-dependent hazard ratio for each novel regime relative to the standard of care while adjusting for the effect of aspartate transaminase, a biomarker of liver function, that is subject to a non-decreasing shape restriction.","Bayesian methods,survival analysis,semiparametric methods,penalized splines,shape-restricted effects,time-dependent effects,colorectal cancer","PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODELS,INFERENCE","Murray, Thomas A.@Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Biostat, Unit 1411, POB 301402, Houston, TX 77230 USA::Hobbs, Brian P.@Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Biostat, Unit 1411, POB 301402, Houston, TX 77230 USA::Sargent, Daniel J.@Mayo Clin, Ctr Canc, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN 55905 USA::Carlin, Bradley P.@Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Biostat, Mayo Mail Code 303, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Murray, Thomas A.@UTMD Anderson Cancer Center@University of Texas System::Hobbs, Brian P.@UTMD Anderson Cancer Center@University of Texas System::Sargent, Daniel J.@Mayo Clinic::Carlin, Bradley P.@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities",not exist,"Generating survival times to simulate Cox proportional hazards models+Bender, R; Augustin, T; Blettner, M+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUN 15 2005::Monotonic regression Bayesian P-splines+Brezger, A.; Steiner, W.+Journal of Business and Economic Statistics+2004::Mixed model-based hazard estimation+Cai, T; Hyndman, RJ; Wand, MP+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+DEC 2002::PARTIAL LIKELIHOOD+COX, DR+BIOMETRIKA+1975::Bayesian analysis for penalized spline regression using WinBUGS+Crainiceanu, C.

Exact and Approximate Bayesian Inference for Low Integer-Valued Time Series Models with Intractable Likelihoods,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA950,JUN 2016,39,1,"In this paper we develop a likelihood-free simulation methodology in order to obtain Bayesian inference for models for low integer-valued time series data that have computationally demanding likelihood functions. The algorithm fits within the framework of particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) methods and uses a so-called alive particle filter. The particle filter requires only model simulations and, in this regard, our approach has connections with approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). However, an advantage of using the PMCMC approach in this setting is that simulated data can be matched with data observed one-at-a-time, rather than attempting to match on the full dataset simultaneously or on a low-dimensional non-sufficient summary statistic, which is common practice in ABC. For low integer-valued time series data, we find that it is often computationally feasible to match simulated data with observed data exactly. The alive particle filter uses negative binomial sampling in order to maintain a fixed number of particles. The algorithm creates an unbiased estimate of the likelihood, resulting in exact posterior inferences when included in an MCMC algorithm. In cases where exact matching is computationally prohibitive, a tolerance is introduced as in ABC. This paper further develops the alive particle filter by introducing auxiliary variables so that partially observed and/or non-Markovian models can be accommodated. We demonstrate that Bayesian model choice problems involving such models can be handled with this approach. The methodology is illustrated on a wide variety of models for simulated and real low-count time series data involving a rich set of applications.","approximate Bayesian computation,branching process,INARMA model,Markov process,particle filter,particle Markov chain Monte Carlo,pseudo-marginal methods","CHAIN MONTE-CARLO,RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS-AUREUS,ARMA PROCESSES,TRANSMISSION,COMPUTATION,ALGORITHM,MATRIX,UNIT","Drovandi, Christopher C.@Queensland Univ Technol, ARC Ctr Excellence Math & Stat Frontiers ACEMS, Sch Math Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia::Pettitt, Anthony N.@Queensland Univ Technol, ARC Ctr Excellence Math & Stat Frontiers ACEMS, Sch Math Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia::McCutchan, Roy A.@Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Math Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia","Drovandi, Christopher C.@Queensland University of Technology (QUT)::Pettitt, Anthony N.@Queensland University of Technology (QUT)::McCutchan, Roy A.@Queensland University of Technology (QUT)","Pettitt, Anthony@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4816-4595::Drovandi, Christopher@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9222-8763","THE PSEUDO-MARGINAL APPROACH FOR EFFICIENT MONTE CARLO COMPUTATIONS+Andrieu, Christophe; Roberts, Gareth O.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2009::Particle Markov chain Monte Carlo methods+Andrieu, Christophe; Doucet, Arnaud; Holenstein, Roman+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2010::Expectation Propagation for Likelihood-Free Inference+Barthelme, Simon; Chopin, Nicolas+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2014::A Comparative Review of Dimension Reduction Methods in Approximate Bayesian Computation+Blum, M.

A Two-Component G-Prior for Variable Selection,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA953,JUN 2016,42,0,"We present a Bayesian variable selection method based on an extension of the Zellner's g-prior in linear models. More specifically, we propose a two-component G-prior, wherein a tuning parameter, calibrated by use of pseudovariables, is introduced to adjust the distance between the two components. We show that implementing the proposed prior in variable selection is more efficient than using the Zellner's g-prior. Simulation results also indicate that models selected using the method with the two-component G-prior are generally more favorable with smaller losses compared to other methods considered in our work. The proposed method is further demonstrated using our motivating gene expression data from a lung disease study, and ozone data analyzed in earlier studies.","Bayes factor,measurement error,mean squared loss,pseudo variables,tuning parameter","MIXED-EFFECTS MODELS,MEASUREMENT ERROR,MULTIPLE-REGRESSION,PULMONARY-FIBROSIS,ORACLE PROPERTIES,GENE SELECTION,DISTRIBUTIONS,LIKELIHOOD,LASSO,SPIKE","Zhang, Hongmei@Univ Memphis, Div Epidemiol Biostat & Environm Hlth, Sch Publ Hlth, Memphis, TN 38152 USA::Huang, Xianzheng@Univ S Carolina, Dept Stat, Columbia, SC 29208 USA::Gan, Jianjun@GlaxoSmithKline, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA::Karmaus, Wilfried@Univ Memphis, Div Epidemiol Biostat & Environm Hlth, Sch Publ Hlth, Memphis, TN 38152 USA::Sabo-Attwood, Tara@Univ Florida, Dept Environm & Global Hlth, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Zhang, Hongmei@University of Memphis::Huang, Xianzheng@University of South Carolina Columbia@University of South Carolina@University of South Carolina System::Gan, Jianjun@GlaxoSmithKline::Karmaus, Wilfried@University of Memphis::Sabo-Attwood, Tara@State University System of Florida@University of Florida",not exist,"A Comment on D.

Expert Information and Nonparametric Bayesian Inference of Rare Events,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA956,JUN 2016,51,1,"Prior distributions are important in Bayesian inference of rare events because historical data information is scarce, and experts are an important source of information for elicitation of a prior distribution. I propose a method to incorporate expert information into nonparametric Bayesian inference on rare events when expert knowledge is elicited as moment conditions on a finite dimensional parameter. only. I generalize the Dirichlet process mixture model to merge expert information into the Dirichlet process (DP) prior to satisfy expert's moment conditions. Among all the priors that comply with expert knowledge, we use the one that is closest to the original DP prior in the Kullback-Leibler information criterion. The resulting prior distribution is given by exponentially tilting the DP prior along.. I provide a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to implement this approach to sample from posterior distributions with exponentially tilted DP priors. The proposed method combines prior information from a statistician and an expert by finding the least-informative prior given expert information.","Dirichlet process mixture,defaults,Kullback-Leibler information criterion,maximum entropy,Metropolis-Hastings algorithm","DIRICHLET PROCESS MIXTURE,PROBABILITY-DISTRIBUTIONS,APPROXIMATE DIRICHLET,DEFAULT ESTIMATION,SAMPLING METHODS,MODELS,PRIORS,ELICITATION,REGRESSION,GEOMETRY","Choi, Hwan-sik@SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, 4400 Vestal Pkwy E,POB 6000, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA","Choi, Hwan-sik@State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton@State University of New York (SUNY) System",not exist,"Methods of Information Geometry+AMARI, S.; NAGAOKA, H.+TRANSLATIONS MATH MO+2000::no title+Amari, S.

Bayesian Registration of Functions and Curves,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA957,JUN 2016,56,8,"Bayesian analysis of functions and curves is considered, where warping and other geometrical transformations are often required for meaningful comparisons. The functions and curves of interest are represented using the recently introduced square root velocity function, which enables a warping invariant elastic distance to be calculated in a straightforward manner. We distinguish between various spaces of interest: the original space, the ambient space after standardizing, and the quotient space after removing a group of transformations. Using Gaussian process models in the ambient space and Dirichlet priors for the warping functions, we explore Bayesian inference for curves and functions. Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms are introduced for simulating from the posterior. We also compare ambient and quotient space estimators for mean shape, and explain their frequent similarity in many practical problems using a Laplace approximation. Simulation studies are carried out, as well as practical alignment of growth rate functions and shape classification of mouse vertebra outlines in evolutionary biology. We also compare the performance of our Bayesian method with some alternative approaches.","ambient space,Dirichlet,Gaussian process,Quotient space,shape,warp","STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS,SHAPE-ANALYSIS,MID-GROWTH,MODEL,MANIFOLDS,ALIGNMENT,SPACES,PROCRUSTES,SAMPLE,MASS","Cheng, Wen@Univ S Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208 USA::Dryden, Ian L.@Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England::Huang, Xianzheng@Univ S Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208 USA","Cheng, Wen@University of South Carolina System@University of South Carolina@University of South Carolina Columbia::Dryden, Ian L.@University of Nottingham::Huang, Xianzheng@University of South Carolina System@University of South Carolina@University of South Carolina Columbia","Dryden, Ian@C-8742-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4900-3571","Towards a coherent statistical framework for dense deformable template estimation+Allassonniere, S.; Amit, Y.; Trouve, A.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2007::Bayesian Consistent Estimation in Deformable Models using Stochastic Algorithms: Applications to Medical Images+Allassonniere, Stephanie; Kuhn, Estelle; Trouve, Alain+JOURNAL OF THE SFDS+2010::Large sample theory of intrinsic and extrinsic sample means on manifolds.

Incorporating Marginal Prior Information in Latent Class Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA959,JUN 2016,25,3,"We present an approach to incorporating informative prior beliefs about marginal probabilities into Bayesian latent class models for categorical data. The basic idea is to append synthetic observations to the original data such that (i) the empirical distributions of the desired margins match those of the prior beliefs, and (ii) the values of the remaining variables are left missing. The degree of prior uncertainty is controlled by the number of augmented records. Posterior inferences can be obtained via typical MCMC algorithms for latent class models, tailored to deal efficiently with the missing values in the concatenated data. We illustrate the approach using a variety of simulations based on data from the American Community Survey, including an example of how augmented records can be used to fit latent class models to data from stratified samples.","categorical,Dirichlet process,missing,mixture,stratified,survey","BAYESIAN MULTIPLE IMPUTATION,CATEGORICAL-DATA,MIXTURE MODEL","Schifeling, Tracy A.@Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Box 90251, Durham, NC 27708 USA::Reiter, Jerome P.@Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Box 90251, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Schifeling, Tracy A.@Duke University::Reiter, Jerome P.@Duke University",not exist,"Nonparametric Bayes regression and classification through mixtures of product kernels.+Dunson, D.

A Mixture Model for Rare and Clustered Populations Under Adaptive Cluster Sampling,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA961,JUN 2016,19,0,"Rare populations, such as endangered species, drug users and individuals infected by rare diseases, tend to cluster in regions. Adaptive cluster designs are generally applied to obtain information from clustered and sparse populations. The aim of this work is to propose a unit-level mixture model for clustered and sparse populations when the data are obtained from an adaptive cluster sample. Our approach considers heterogeneity among units belonging to different clusters. The proposed model is evaluated using simulated data and a real experiment in which adaptive samples were drawn from an enumeration of a waterfowl species in a 5,000 km(2) area of central Florida. The results show that the model is efficient under many settings, even when the level of heterogeneity is low.","informative sampling,Poisson mixture,RJMCMC","BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS,DENSITY","Goncalves, Kelly C.

Posterior Propriety for Hierarchical Models with Log-Likelihoods That Have Norm Bounds,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA962,JUN 2016,49,0,"Statisticians often use improper priors to express ignorance or to provide good frequency properties, requiring that posterior propriety be verified. This paper addresses generalized linear mixed models, GLMMs, when Level I parameters have Normal distributions, with many commonly-used hyperpriors. It provides easy-to-verify sufficient posterior propriety conditions based on dimensions, matrix ranks, and exponentiated norm bounds, ENBs, for the Level I likelihood. Since many familiar likelihoods have ENBs, which is often verifiable via log-concavity and MLE finiteness, our novel use of ENBs permits unification of posterior propriety results and posterior MGF/moment results for many useful Level I distributions, including those commonly used with multilevel generalized linear models, e.g., GLMMs and hierarchical generalized linear models, HGLMs. Those who need to verify existence of posterior distributions or of posterior MGFs/moments for a multilevel generalized linear model given a proper or improper multivariate F prior as in Section 1 should find the required results in Sections 1 and 2 and Theorem 3 (GLMMs), Theorem 4 (HGLMs), or Theorem 5 (posterior MGFs/moments).","exponentiated norm bound,generalized linear mixed model,hierarchical generalized linear model,improper prior,multilevel objective Bayes","GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,MIXED MODELS,LOGISTIC-REGRESSION,BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS,IMPROPER PRIORS,NONINFORMATIVE PRIORS,EXISTENCE,INFERENCE,MLE,DISTRIBUTIONS","Michalak, Sarah E.@Los Alamos Natl Lab, POB 1663, Los Alamos, NM 87544 USA::Morris, Carl N.@Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Michalak, Sarah E.@Los Alamos National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)::Morris, Carl N.@Harvard University",not exist,"THE MULTIVARIATE POISSON-LOG NORMAL-DISTRIBUTION+AITCHISON, J; HO, CH+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1989::ON THE EXISTENCE OF MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATES IN LOGISTIC-REGRESSION MODELS+ALBERT, A; ANDERSON, JA+BIOMETRIKA+1984::Estimation of integrals with respect to infinite measures using regenerative sequences+Athreya, K.

Importance Sampling Schemes for Evidence Approximation in Mixture Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA970,JUN 2016,59,1,"The marginal likelihood is a central tool for drawing Bayesian inference about the number of components in mixture models. It is often approximated since the exact form is unavailable. A bias in the approximation may be due to an incomplete exploration by a simulated Markov chain (e.g. a Gibbs sequence) of the collection of posterior modes, a phenomenon also known as lack of label switching, as all possible label permutations must be simulated by a chain in order to converge and hence overcome the bias. In an importance sampling approach, imposing label switching to the importance function results in an exponential increase of the computational cost with the number of components. In this paper, two importance sampling schemes are proposed through choices for the importance function: a maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) proposal and a Rao-Blackwellised importance function. The second scheme is called dual importance sampling. We demonstrate that this dual importance sampling is a valid estimator of the evidence. To reduce the induced high demand in computation, the original importance function is approximated, but a suitable approximation can produce an estimate with the same precision and with less computational workload.","model evidence,importance sampling,mixture models,marginal likelihood","MARGINAL LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION,LABEL SWITCHING PROBLEM,MONTE-CARLO METHODS,POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTIONS,BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS,NORMALIZING CONSTANTS,UNKNOWN NUMBER,DENSITY,DIFFICULTIES,COMPONENTS","Lee, Jeong Eun@Auckland Univ Technol, Auckland, New Zealand::Robert, Christian P.@Univ Paris 09, PSL, Paris, France@Univ Warwick, CEREMADE, Dept Stat, Paris, France@CREST, Paris, France","Lee, Jeong Eun@Auckland University of Technology::Robert, Christian P.@PSL Research University Paris (ComUE)@University of Paris Dauphine",not exist,"MIXTURES OF DIRICHLET PROCESSES WITH APPLICATIONS TO BAYESIAN NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS+ANTONIAK, CE+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1974::A comparative study of Monte Carlo methods for efficient evaluation of marginal likelihood+Ardia, David; Basturk, Nalan; Hoogerheide, Lennart; et al.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+NOV 2012::A Bayesian approach to the selection and testing of mixture models+Berkhof, J; van Mechelen, I; Gelman, A+STATISTICA SINICA+APR 2003::BAYESIAN MODEL CHOICE VIA MARKOV-CHAIN MONTE-CARLO METHODS+CARLIN, BP; CHIB, S+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1995::Computational and inferential difficulties with mixture posterior distributions.+Celeux, G; Hurn, M; Robert, CP+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2000::no title+Chen, M.-H.; Shao, Q.

Bayesian Quantile Regression for Ordinal Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA939,MAR 2016,33,3,"The paper introduces a Bayesian estimation method for quantile regression in univariate ordinal models. Two algorithms are presented that utilize the latent variable inferential framework of Albert and Chib (1993) and the normal-exponential mixture representation of the asymmetric Laplace distribution. Estimation utilizes Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation - either Gibbs sampling together with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm or only Gibbs sampling. The algorithms are employed in two simulation studies and implemented in the analysis of problems in economics (educational attainment) and political economy (public opinion on extending ""Bush Tax"" cuts).

Objective Bayesian Inference for a Generalized Marginal Random Effects Model,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/14-BA933,MAR 2016,31,11,"An objective Bayesian inference is proposed for the generalized marginal random effects model p(x vertical bar mu, sigma(lambda)) - f((x - mu 1)(T) (V + sigma I-2(lambda))(-1) (x - mu 1))/root det(V+sigma I-2(lambda)). The matrix V is assumed to be known, and the goal is to infer mu given the observations x = (x(1), ..., x(n))(T), while sigma(lambda) is a nuisance parameter. In metrology this model has been applied for the adjustment of inconsistent data x1,..., xn, where the matrix V contains the uncertainties quoted for x1,..., xn. We show that the reference prior for x(1,) ..., x(n).

We show that the reference prior for grouping {mu, sigma(lambda)} is given by pi(mu, sigma(lambda)) infinity root F-22, where F-22 denotes the lower right element of the Fisher information matrix F. We give an explicit expression for the reference prior, and we also prove propriety of the resulting posterior as well as the existence of mean and variance of the marginal posterior for mu. Under the additional assumption of normality, we relate the resulting reference analysis to that known for the conventional balanced random effects model in the asymptotic case when the number of repeated within-class observations for that model tends to infinity.

We investigate the frequentist properties of the proposed inference for the generalized marginal random effects model through simulations, and we also study its robustness when the underlying distributional assumptions are violated. Finally, we apply the model to the adjustment of current measurements of the Planck constant.","objective Bayesian inference,reference prior,random effects model","VARIANCE-COMPONENTS,REFERENCE PRIORS","Bodnar, O.@Phys Tech Bundesanstalt, Abbestr 2-L2, D-10587 Berlin, Germany::Link, A.@Phys Tech Bundesanstalt, Abbestr 2-L2, D-10587 Berlin, Germany::Elster, C.@Phys Tech Bundesanstalt, Abbestr 2-L2, D-10587 Berlin, Germany","Bodnar, O.@Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB)::Link, A.@Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB)::Elster, C.@Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB)",not exist,"no title+Andrews, GE; Askey, R; Roy, R.+Special functions+2000::Bayesian inference in spherical linear models: robustness and conjugate analysis+Arellano-Valle, RB; del Pino, G; Iglesias, P+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+JAN 2006::Reference priors in a variance components problem+Berger, J; Bernardo, JM.+P IND US WORKSH BAYE+1992::ORDERED GROUP REFERENCE PRIORS WITH APPLICATION TO THE MULTINOMIAL PROBLEM+BERGER, JO; BERNARDO, JM+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1992::no title+Bernardo, J.

Approximate Bayesian Inference for Doubly Robust Estimation,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/14-BA928,MAR 2016,25,3,Doubly robust estimators are typically constructed by combining outcome regression and propensity score models to satisfy moment restrictions that ensure consistent estimation of causal quantities provided at least one of the component models is correctly specified. Standard Bayesian methods are difficult to apply because restricted moment models do not imply fully specified likelihood functions. This paper proposes a Bayesian bootstrap approach to derive approximate posterior predictive distributions that are doubly robust for estimation of causal quantities. Simulations show that the approach performs well under various sources of misspecification of the outcome regression or propensity score models. The estimator is applied in a case study of the effect of area deprivation on the incidence of child pedestrian casualties in British cities.,"approximate bayes,doubly robust,propensity score,treatment effect","PROPENSITY SCORE,MODELS,BOOTSTRAP","Graham, Daniel J.@Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Civil Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England::McCoy, Emma J.@Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Math, London SW7 2AZ, England::Stephens, David A.@McGill Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Montreal, PQ, Canada","Graham, Daniel J.@Imperial College London::McCoy, Emma J.@Imperial College London::Stephens, David A.@McGill University",not exist,"Doubly robust estimation in missing data and causal inference models+Bang, H+BIOMETRICS+DEC 2005::Nonparametric applications of Bayesian inference+Chamberlain, G; Imbens, GW+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JAN 2003::Social, economic and environmental factors in child pedestrian accidents: a research overview+Christie, N.+Technical Report 116+1995::ESTIMATING THE EFFECTS OF LENGTH OF EXPOSURE TO INSTRUCTION IN A TRAINING PROGRAM: THE CASE OF JOB CORPS+Flores, Carlos A.; Flores-Lagunes, Alfonso; Gonzalez, Arturo; et al.+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+FEB 2012::Semiparametric double-robust estimation for continuous treatment effects+Graham, D.

Bayesian Clustering of Functional Data Using Local Features,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/14-BA925,MAR 2016,21,2,"The use of exploratory methods is an important step in the understanding of data. When clustering functional data, most methods use traditional clustering techniques on a vector of estimated basis coefficients, assuming that the underlying signal functions live in the L-2-space. Bayesian methods use models which imply the belief that some observations are realizations from some signal plus noise models with identical underlying signal functions. The method we propose differs in this respect: we employ a model that does not assume that any of the signal functions are truly identical, but possibly share many of their local features, represented by coefficients in a multiresolution wavelet basis expansion. We cluster each wavelet coefficient of the signal functions using conditionally independent Dirichlet process priors, thus focusing on exact matching of local features. We then demonstrate the method using two datasets from different fields to show broad application potential.","Dirichlet process prior,wavelets,exploratory analysis","DENSITY-ESTIMATION,INFERENCE,MIXTURES,MODELS","Suarez, Adam Justin@N Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA::Ghosal, Subhashis@N Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Suarez, Adam Justin@North Carolina State University@University of North Carolina::Ghosal, Subhashis@North Carolina State University@University of North Carolina",not exist,"Wavelet thresholding via a Bayesian approach+Abramovich, F; Sapatinas, T; Silverman, BW+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1998::Indications of nonlinear deterministic and finite-dimensional structures in time series of brain electrical activity: Dependence on recording region and brain state+Andrzejak, RG; Lehnertz, K; Mormann, F; et al.+PHYSICAL REVIEW E+DEC 2001::Adaptive Bayesian inference on the mean of an infinite-dimensional normal distribution+Belitser, E; Ghosal, S+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2003::FERGUSON DISTRIBUTIONS VIA POLYA URN SCHEMES+BLACKWELL, D; MACQUEEN, JB+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1973::Wavelets on the interval and fast wavelet transforms+Cohen, A.; Daubechies, I.; Vial, P.+Applied and Computational Harmonic Analysis+Dec. 1993::Posterior simulation across nonparametric models for functional clustering+Crandell, Jamie L.; Dunson, David B.+SANKHYA-SERIES B-APPLIED AND INTERDISCIPLINARY STATISTICS+MAY 2011::BAYESIAN DENSITY-ESTIMATION AND INFERENCE USING MIXTURES+ESCOBAR, MD; WEST, M+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1995::no title+Galassi, M.; Davies, J.; Rossi, F.+GNU Scientific Library: Reference Manual+2009::Posterior consistency of Dirichlet mixtures in density estimation+Ghosal, S; Ghosh, JK; Ramamoorthi, RV+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 1999::Clustering for sparsely sampled functional data+James, GM; Sugar, CA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2003::An approximation theorem for the Poisson binomial distribution+Le Cam, L.+Pacific J Math+1960::On posterior distribution of Bayesian wavelet thresholding+Lian, Heng+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+JAN 2011::Clustering of time series data - a survey+Liao, TW+PATTERN RECOGNITION+NOV 2005::Some issues in nonparametric Bayesian modelling using species sampling models+Navarrete, Carlos; Quintana, Fernando A.; Mueller, Peter+STATISTICAL MODELLING+APR 2008::Hybrid Dirichlet mixture models for functional data+Petrone, Sonia; Guindani, Michele; Gelfand, Alan E.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2009::Some developments of the Blackwell-MacQueen urn scheme+Pitman, J.+LECT NOTES MONOGRAPH+1996::Functional clustering by Bayesian wavelet methods+Ray, S; Mallick, B+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2006::Estimating and clustering curves in the presence of heteroscedastic errors+Serban, Nicoleta+JOURNAL OF NONPARAMETRIC STATISTICS+2008::Clustering functional data+Tarpey, T; Kinateder, KKJ+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+2003::Hierarchical beta processes and the Indian buffet process+Thibaux, R.; Jordan, M.+INT C ART INT STAT+2007::HIERARCHICAL GROUPING TO OPTIMIZE AN OBJECTIVE FUNCTION+WARD, JH+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1963"
Bayesian Graphical Models for Differential Pathways,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/14-BA931,MAR 2016,52,6,"Graphical models can be used to characterize the dependence structure for a set of random variables. In some applications, the form of dependence varies across different subgroups. This situation arises, for example, when protein activation on a certain pathway is recorded, and a subgroup of patients is characterized by a pathological disruption of that pathway. A similar situation arises when one subgroup of patients is treated with a drug that targets that same pathway. In both cases, understanding changes in the joint distribution and dependence structure across the two subgroups is key to the desired inference. Fitting a single model for the entire data could mask the differences. Separate independent analyses, on the other hand, could reduce the effective sample size and ignore the common features. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian graphical model that addresses heterogeneity and implements borrowing of strength across the two subgroups by simultaneously centering the prior towards a global network. The key feature is a hierarchical prior for graphs that borrows strength across edges, resulting in a comparison of pathways across subpopulations (differential pathways) under a unified model-based framework.

A new framework of simultaneous graphical dynamic models allows the decoupling of analyses into those of a parallel set of univariate time series dynamic models, while flexibly modeling time-varying, cross-series dependencies and volatilities. The strategy allows for exact analysis of univariate time series models that are then coherently linked to represent the full multivariate model. Computation uses importance sampling and variational Bayes ideas, and is ideally suited to GPU-based parallelization. The analysis and its GPU-accelerated implementation is scalable with time series dimension, as we demonstrate in an analysis of a 400-dimensional financial time series.","decoupling models,high-dimensional time series,importance sampling,parallel computing,recoupling models,variational Bayes",,"Gruber, Lutz@Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Math, D-80290 Munich, Germany::West, Mike@Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC USA","Gruber, Lutz@Technical University of Munich::West, Mike@Duke University",not exist,"no title+Abramowitz, M; Stegun, I A.+HDB MATH FUNCTIONS F+1972::Forecasting high-dimensional data+Agarwal, D.; Chen, D.; Lin, L.-j.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Shanmugasundaram, J.; Vee, E</span>.+P 2010 INT ACM SIGMO+2010::Bayesian dynamic factor models and portfolio allocation+Aguilar, O; West, M+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JUL 2000::NONLINEAR BAYESIAN ESTIMATION USING GAUSSIAN SUM APPROXIMATIONS+ALSPACH, DL; SORENSON, HW+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1972::Multivariate forecasting of road traffic flows in the presence of heteroscedasticity and measurement errors+Anacleto, Osvaldo; Queen, Catriona; Albers, Casper J.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2013::no title+Anselin,, L.+Spatial econometrics: methods and models+1988::no title+Atkinson, K.

Bayesian Inference for Partially Observed Multiplicative Intensity Processes,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA940,MAR 2016,14,0,"Poisson processes are used in various applications. In their homogeneous version, the intensity process is a deterministic constant whereas it depends on time in their inhomogeneous version. To allow for an endogenous evolution of the intensity process, we consider multiplicative intensity processes. Inference methods for such processes have been developed when the trajectories are fully observed, that is to say, when both the sizes of the jumps and the jumps instants are observed. In this paper, we deal with the case of a partially observed process: we assume that the jumps sizes are non- or partially observed whereas the time events are fully observed. Moreover, we consider the case where the initial state of the process at time 0 is unknown. The inference being strongly influenced by this quantity, we propose a sensible prior distribution on the initial state, using the probabilistic properties of the process. We illustrate the performances of our methodology on a large simulation study.","Bayesian analysis,counting process,latent variables,multiplicative intensity process",,"Donnet, Sophie@AgroParisTech, INRA, UMR AgroParisTech 518, 16 Rue Claude Bernard, F-75231 Paris 06, France::Rousseau, Judith@Univ Paris 09, CEREMADE, Pl Marechal DeLattre de Tassigny, F-75016 Paris, France","Donnet, Sophie@Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA)@AgroParisTech@Universite Paris Saclay (ComUE)::Rousseau, Judith@PSL Research University Paris (ComUE)@Universite Paris-Dauphine",not exist,"NONPARAMETRIC INFERENCE FOR A FAMILY OF COUNTING PROCESSES+AALEN, O+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1978::no title+Anderson, P.

Exploiting Multi-Core Architectures for Reduced-Variance Estimation with Intractable Likelihoods,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA948,MAR 2016,70,1,"Many popular statistical models for complex phenomena are intractable, in the sense that the likelihood function cannot easily be evaluated. Bayesian estimation in this setting remains challenging, with a lack of computational methodology to fully exploit modern processing capabilities. In this paper we introduce novel control variates for intractable likelihoods that can dramatically reduce the Monte Carlo variance of Bayesian estimators. We prove that our control variates are well-defined and provide a positive variance reduction. Furthermore, we show how to optimise these control variates for variance reduction. The methodology is highly parallel and offers a route to exploit multi-core processing architectures that complements recent research in this direction. Indeed, our work shows that it may not be necessary to parallelise the sampling process itself in order to harness the potential of massively multi-core architectures. Simulation results presented on the Ising model, exponential random graph models and non-linear stochastic differential equation models support our theoretical findings.","control variates,MCMC,parallel computing,zero variance","CHAIN MONTE-CARLO,MARKOV RANDOM-FIELDS,GIBBS RANDOM-FIELDS,BAYESIAN-INFERENCE,PARAMETER-ESTIMATION,DIFFUSION-PROCESSES,SOCIAL NETWORKS,MODELS,ALGORITHMS,SIMULATION","Friel, Nial@Univ Coll Dublin, Natl Ctr Data Analyt, Sch Math Sci & Insight, Dublin, Ireland::Mira, Antonietta@Univ Lugano, Interdisciplinary Inst Data Sci, Lugano, Switzerland@Univ Lugano, Inst Finance, Lugano, Switzerland::Oates, Chris J.@Univ Warwick, Dept Stat, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England","Friel, Nial@University College Dublin::Mira, Antonietta@University of Lugano::Oates, Chris J.@University of Warwick","Friel, Nial@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4778-0254","Bayesian posterior sampling via stochastic gradient Fisher scoring.+Ahn, S; Korattikara, A; Welling, M.+P 29 INT C MACH LEAR+2012::Noisy Monte Carlo: convergence of Markov chains with approximate transition kernels+Alquier, P.; Friel, N.; Everitt, R.; et al.+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+JAN 2016::Variance reduction through smoothing and control variates for Markov chain simulations+Andradottir, S.; Heyman, D.P.; Ott, T.J.+ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation+July 1993::THE PSEUDO-MARGINAL APPROACH FOR EFFICIENT MONTE CARLO COMPUTATIONS+Andrieu, Christophe; Roberts, Gareth O.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2009::Particle Markov chain Monte Carlo methods+Andrieu, Christophe; Doucet, Arnaud; Holenstein, Roman+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2010::Accelerating MCMC via parallel predictive prefetching.+Angelino,, E.; Kohler,, E.; Waterland,, A.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Seltzer,, M.; Adams,, R</span>.+arXiv preprint arXiv:1403. 7265+2014::A stochastic model dissects cell states in biological transition processes+Armond, Jonathan W.; Saha, Krishanu; Rana, Anas A.; et al.+SCIENTIFIC REPORTS+JAN 17 2014::Zero-variance principle for Monte Carlo algorithms+Assaraf, R; Caffarel, M+PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS+DEC 6 1999::On stochastic proximal gradient algorithms+Atchade, Yves F; Fort, Gersende; Moulines, Eric.+arXiv preprint arXiv: 1402. 2365+2014::An autologistic model for the spatial distribution of wildlife+Augustin, NH; Mugglestone, MA; Buckland, ST+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY+APR 1996::Bayesian modeling of multivariate spatial binary data with applications to dental caries+Bandyopadhyay, Dipankar; Reich, Brian J.; Slate, Elizabeth H.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+DEC 10 2009::Towards scaling up Markov chain Monte Carlo: An adaptive subsampling approach.+Bardenet,, R.; Doucet,, A.; Holmes,, C.+P 31 INT C MACH LEAR+2014::SPATIAL INTERACTION AND STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS OF LATTICE SYSTEMS+BESAG, J+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1974::Nearest-neighbour systems and the auto-logistic model for binary data+Besag, J.

Recursive Learning for Sparse Markov Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA949,MAR 2016,18,2,"Markov chains of higher order are popular models for a wide variety of applications in natural language and DNA sequence processing. However, since the number of parameters grows exponentially with the order of a Markov chain, several alternative model classes have been proposed that allow for stability and higher rate of data compression. The common notion to these models is that they cluster the possible sample paths used to predict the next state into invariance classes with identical conditional distributions assigned to the same class. The models vary in particular with respect to constraints imposed on legitime partitions of the sample paths. Here we consider the class of sparse Markov chains for which the partition is left unconstrained a priori. A recursive computation scheme based on Delaunay triangulation of the parameter space is introduced to enable fast approximation of the posterior mode partition. Comparisons with stochastic optimization, k-means and nearest neighbor algorithms show that our approach is both considerably faster and leads on average to a more accurate estimate of the underlying partition. We show additionally that the criterion used in the recursive steps for comparison of triangulation cell contents leads to consistent estimation of the local structure in the sparse Markov model.","clustering,Delaunay triangulation,recursive learning,sequence analysis,sparse Markov chains","DELAUNAY TRIANGULATION,PARTITION MODELS","Xiong, Jie@Univ Helsinki, Dept Math & Stat, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland::Jaaskinen, Vaino@Univ Helsinki, Dept Math & Stat, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland::Corander, Jukka@Univ Helsinki, Dept Math & Stat, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland@Abo Akad Univ, Dept Math, Turku, Finland","Xiong, Jie@University of Helsinki::Jaaskinen, Vaino@University of Helsinki::Corander, Jukka@Abo Akademi University@University of Helsinki",not exist,"On prediction using variable order Markov models+Begleiter, R; El-Yaniv, R; Yona, G+JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH+2004::no title+Bishop, C.

Spatial Product Partition Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA971,MAR 2016,43,5,"When modeling geostatistical or areal data, spatial structure is commonly accommodated via a covariance function for the former and a neighborhood structure for the latter. In both cases the resulting spatial structure is a consequence of implicit spatial grouping in that observations near in space are assumed to behave similarly. It would be desirable to develop spatial methods that explicitly model the partitioning of spatial locations providing more control over resulting spatial structures and be able to better balance local and global spatial dependence. To this end, we extend product partition models to a spatial setting so that the partitioning of locations into spatially dependent clusters is explicitly modeled. We explore the resulting spatial structure and demonstrate its flexibility in accommodating many types of spatial dependencies. We illustrate the method's utility through simulation studies and two applications. Computational techniques with additional simulations are provided in a Supplementary Material file available online.","product partition models,spatial smoothing,spatial clustering,spatial prediction",DIRICHLET PROCESS MIXTURE,"Page, Garritt L.@Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Estadist, Alameda 340, Santiago, Chile::Quintana, Fernando A.@Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Estadist, Alameda 340, Santiago, Chile","Page, Garritt L.@Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile::Quintana, Fernando A.@Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile",not exist,"no title+Banerjee, S.; Carlin, B.

Then, adopting the viewpoint of extreme value theory, we focus on two approaches for modeling spatial extremes, namely hierarchical modeling based on a latent stochastic process and modeling based on max-stable processes.

Restricted Covariance Priors with Applications in Spatial Statistics,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/14-BA927,DEC 2015,48,3,"We present a Bayesian model for area-level count data that uses Gaussian random effects with a novel type of G-Wishart prior on the inverse variance-covariance matrix. Specifically, we introduce a new distribution called the truncated G-Wishart distribution that has support over precision matrices that lead to positive associations between the random effects of neighboring regions while preserving conditional independence of non-neighboring regions. We describe Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithms for the truncated G-Wishart prior in a disease mapping context and compare our results to Bayesian hierarchical models based on intrinsic autoregression priors. A simulation study illustrates that using the truncated G-Wishart prior improves over the intrinsic autoregressive priors when there are discontinuities in the disease risk surface. The new model is applied to an analysis of cancer incidence data in Washington State.","G-Wishart distribution,Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC),spatial statistics,disease mapping","GAUSSIAN GRAPHICAL MODELS,CONDITIONAL AUTOREGRESSIVE MODELS,BAYESIAN-INFERENCE,AREAL DATA,CAR","Smith, Theresa R.@Univ Washington, Dept Stat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA::Wakefield, Jon@Univ Washington, Dept Stat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA@Univ Washington, Dept Biostat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA::Dobra, Adrian@Univ Washington, Dept Stat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA@Univ Washington, Dept Biobehav Nursing, Seattle, WA 98195 USA@Univ Washington, Dept Hlth Syst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA@Univ Washington, Ctr Stat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA@Univ Washington, Social Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Smith, Theresa R.@University of Washington@University of Washington Seattle::Wakefield, Jon@University of Washington@University of Washington Seattle::Dobra, Adrian@University of Washington@University of Washington Seattle","Smith, Theresa@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7085-3864","Monte Carlo method for computing the marginal likelihood in nondecomposable Gaussian graphical models+Atay-Kayis, A; Massam, H+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 2005::no title+Banerjee, S.; Carlin, B.

Bayesian Variable Selection and Estimation for Group Lasso,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/14-BA929,DEC 2015,43,9,"The paper revisits the Bayesian group lasso and uses spike and slab priors for group variable selection. In the process, the connection of our model with penalized regression is demonstrated, and the role of posterior median for thresholding is pointed out. We show that the posterior median estimator has the oracle property for group variable selection and estimation under orthogonal designs, while the group lasso has suboptimal asymptotic estimation rate when variable selection consistency is achieved. Next we consider bi-level selection problem and propose the Bayesian sparse group selection again with spike and slab priors to select variables both at the group level and also within a group. We demonstrate via simulation that the posterior median estimator of our spike and slab models has excellent performance for both variable selection and estimation.","group variable selection,spike and slab prior,Gibbs sampling,median thresholding","LINEAR-MODELS,SPARSE SEQUENCES,REGRESSION,SHRINKAGE,NEEDLES,PRIORS,STRAW","Xu, Xiaofan@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA::Ghosh, Malay@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Xu, Xiaofan@State University System of Florida@University of Florida::Ghosh, Malay@State University System of Florida@University of Florida",not exist,"Wavelet thresholding via a Bayesian approach+Abramovich, F; Sapatinas, T; Silverman, BW+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1998::Optimal predictive model selection+Barbieri, MM; Berger, JO+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2004::Bayesian ensemble methods for survival prediction in gene expression data+Bonato, Vinicius; Baladandayuthapani, Veerabhadran; Broom, Bradley M.; et al.+BIOINFORMATICS+FEB 1 2011::Bayes model averaging with selection of regressors+Brown, PJ; Vannucci, M; Fearn, T+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2002::Empirical Bayes Gibbs sampling.+Casella, G+Biostatistics (Oxford, England)+2001-Dec::NEEDLES AND STRAW IN A HAYSTACK: POSTERIOR CONCENTRATION FOR POSSIBLY SPARSE SEQUENCES+Castillo, Ismael; van der Vaart, Aad+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+AUG 2012::Bootstrapping Lasso Estimators+Chatterjee, A.; Lahiri, S.

Sequential Bayesian Model Selection of Regular Vine Copulas,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/14-BA930,DEC 2015,25,9,"Regular vine copulas can describe a wider array of dependency patterns than the multivariate Gaussian copula or the multivariate Student's t copula. This paper presents two contributions related to model selection of regular vine copulas. First, our pair copula family selection procedure extends existing Bayesian family selection methods by allowing pair families to be chosen from an arbitrary set of candidate families. Second, our method represents the first Bayesian model selection approach to include the regular vine density construction in its scope of inference. The merits of our approach are established in a simulation study that benchmarks against methods suggested in current literature. A real data example about forecasting of portfolio asset returns for risk measurement and investment allocation illustrates the viability and relevance of the proposed scheme.","dependence models,graphical models,reversible jump MCMC,multivariate statistics,multivariate time series,portfolio risk forecasting","CONSTRUCTIONS,DECOMPOSITION","Gruber, Lutz@Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Math, D-80290 Munich, Germany::Czado, Claudia@Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Math, D-80290 Munich, Germany","Gruber, Lutz@Technical University of Munich::Czado, Claudia@Technical University of Munich","Czado, Claudia@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6329-5438","Probability density decomposition for conditionally dependent random variables modeled by vines+Bedford, T; Cooke, RM+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE+2001::no title+no author+Boost C++ Libraries+2014::Truncated regular vines in high dimensions with application to financial data+Brechmann, E.

On Posterior Concentration in Misspecified Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA941,DEC 2015,10,3,"We investigate the asymptotic behavior of Bayesian posterior distributions under independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) misspecified models. More specifically, we study the concentration of the posterior distribution on neighborhoods of f(star), the density that is closest in the Kullback-Leibler sense to the true model f(0). We note, through examples, the need for assumptions beyond the usual Kullback-Leibler support assumption. We then investigate consistency with respect to a general metric under three assumptions, each based on a notion of divergence measure, and then apply these to a weighted L-1-metric in convex models and non-convex models.

Although a few results on this topic are available, we believe that these are somewhat inaccessible due, in part, to the technicalities and the subtle differences compared to the more familiar well-specified model case. One of our goals is to make some of the available results, especially that of Kleijn and van der Vaart (2006), more accessible. Unlike their paper, our approach does not require construction of test sequences. We also discuss a preliminary extension of the i.i.d. results to the independent but not identically distributed (i.n.i.d.) case.","Bayesian,consistency,misspecified,Kullback-Leibler","BAYESIAN QUANTILE REGRESSION,CONSISTENCY,INCORRECT,BEHAVIOR","Ramamoorthi, R.

A Bayesian Beta Markov Random Field Calibration of the Term Structure of Implied Risk Neutral Densities,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA960SI,DEC 2015,75,2,"We build on the derivative pricing calibration literature, and propose a more general calibration model for implied risk neutral densities. Our model allows for the joint calibration of a set of densities at different maturities and dates through a Bayesian dynamic Beta Markov Random Field. Our approach allows for possible time dependence between densities with the same maturity, and for dependence across maturities at the same point in time. This approach to the risk neutral density calibration problem encompasses model flexibility, parameter parsimony, and, more importantly, information pooling across densities. This proposed methodology can be naturally extended to other areas where multidimensional calibration is needed.","Bayesian inference,Beta Markov Random Fields,exchange Metropolis Hastings,risk neutral measure,density calibration,distortion function","INTRACTABLE NORMALIZING CONSTANTS,INTEREST-RATE EXPECTATIONS,INTEREST-RATES,DISTRIBUTIONS,MODELS,FORECASTS,PRICES,MANAGEMENT,OPTIONS,REGRESSION","Casarin, Roberto@Univ Ca Foscari Venice, Venice, Italy::Leisen, Fabrizio@Univ Kent, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England::Molina, German@Idal Capital Grp, Los Angeles, CA USA@Idal Capital Grp, Los Angeles, CA USA::ter Horst, Enrique@CESA, Bogota, Colombia@IESA, Caracas, Venezuela","Casarin, Roberto@Universita Ca Foscari Venezia::Leisen, Fabrizio@University of Kent::Molina, German@Unknow::ter Horst, Enrique@Unknow","Casarin, Roberto@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1746-9190::Leisen, Fabrizio@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2460-6176","Nonparametric estimation of state-price densities implicit in financial asset prices+Ait-Sahalia, Y; Lo, AW+JOURNAL OF FINANCE+APR 1998::Nonparametric estimation of state-price densities implicit in financial asset prices+Ait-Sahalia, Y.; Lo, A.+Journal of Finance+1998::Coherent measures of risk+Artzner, P; Delbaen, F; Eber, JM; et al.+MATHEMATICAL FINANCE+JUL 1999::Bayesian computation for statistical models with intractable normalizing constants+Atchade, Yves F.; Lartillot, Nicolas; Robert, Christian+BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF PROBABILITY AND STATISTICS+NOV 2013::Testing density forecasts, with applications to risk management+Berkowitz, J+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+OCT 2001::Expectations of monetary policy in Australia implied by the probability distribution of interest rate derivatives+Bhar, R.; Chiarella, C.+European Journal of Finance+2000::Time-varying combinations of predictive densities using nonlinear filtering+Billio, Monica; Casarin, Roberto; Ravazzolo, Francesco; et al.+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+DEC 2013::PRICING OF OPTIONS AND CORPORATE LIABILITIES+BLACK, F; SCHOLES, M+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+1973::Testing the stability of implied probability density functions+Bliss, RR; Panigirtzoglou, N+JOURNAL OF BANKING &amp; FINANCE+MAR 2002::Option-implied risk aversion estimates+Bliss, RR; Panigirtzoglou, N+JOURNAL OF FINANCE+FEB 2004::Practical Bayesian estimation of a finite beta mixture through gibbs sampling and its applications+Bouguila, N; Ziou, D; Monga, E+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+JUN 2006::Bayesian beta regression: Applications to household expenditure data and genetic distance between foot-and-mouth disease viruses+Branscum, Adam J.; Johnson, Wesley O.; Thurmond, Mark C.+AUSTRALIAN &amp; NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+SEP 2007::PRICES OF STATE-CONTINGENT CLAIMS IMPLICIT IN OPTION PRICES+BREEDEN, DT; LITZENBERGER, RH+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS+1978::no title+Bremaud, P.+Markov Chains: Gibbs Fields, Monte Carlo Simulation, and Queues+1999::ERM bandwidths for EMU and after: evidence from foreign exchange options+Campa, J.; Chang, P.; Reider, R.+Economic Policy+1997::Implied exchange rate distributions: evidence from OTC option markets+Campa, JM; Chang, PHK; Reider, RL+JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MONEY AND FINANCE+FEB 1998::Recovering market expectations of FOMC rate changes with options on federal funds futures+Carlson, JB; Craig, BR; Melick, WR+JOURNAL OF FUTURES MARKETS+DEC 2005::Bayesian Model Selection for Beta Autoregressive Processes+Casarin, R.; Valle, L.

A Fully Nonparametric Modeling Approach to Binary Regression,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA963SI,DEC 2015,54,7,"We propose a general nonparametric Bayesian framework for binary regression, which is built from modeling for the joint response-covariate distribution. The observed binary responses are assumed to arise from underlying continuous random variables through discretization, and we model the joint distribution of these latent responses and the covariates using a Dirichlet process mixture of multivariate normals. We show that the kernel of the induced mixture model for the observed data is identifiable upon a restriction on the latent variables. To allow for appropriate dependence structure while facilitating identifiability, we use a square-root-free Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix in the normal mixture kernel. In addition to allowing for the necessary restriction, this modeling strategy provides substantial simplifications in implementation of Markov chain Monte Carlo posterior simulation. We present two data examples taken from areas for which the methodology is especially well suited. In particular, the first example involves estimation of relationships between environmental variables, and the second develops inference for natural selection surfaces in evolutionary biology. Finally, we discuss extensions to regression settings with ordinal responses.","Bayesian nonparametrics,Dirichlet process mixture model,identifiability,Markov chain Monte Carlo,ordinal regression","DIRICHLET PROCESS MIXTURES,GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,STICK-BREAKING PROCESSES,BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS,LOGISTIC-REGRESSION,NATURAL-SELECTION,SAMPLING METHODS,INFERENCE,PRIORS","DeYoreo, Maria@Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA::Kottas, Athanasios@Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Appl Math & Stat, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","DeYoreo, Maria@Duke University::Kottas, Athanasios@University of California Santa Cruz@University of California System",not exist,"BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS OF BINARY AND POLYCHOTOMOUS RESPONSE DATA+ALBERT, JH; CHIB, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1993::A Bayesian Nonparametric Regression Model With Normalized Weights: A Study of Hippocampal Atrophy in Alzheimer's Disease+Antoniano-Villalobos, Isadora; Wade, Sara; Walker, Stephen G.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2014::Bayesian analysis of binary regression using symmetric and asymmetric links+Basu, S.; Mukhopadhyay, S.+Sankhya: The Indian Journal of Statistics, Series B+2000::no title+Box, G.

Entity Resolution with Empirically Motivated Priors,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA965SI,DEC 2015,31,5,"Databases often contain corrupted, degraded, and noisy data with duplicate entries across and within each database. Such problems arise in citations, medical databases, genetics, human rights databases, and a variety of other applied settings. The target of statistical inference can be viewed as an unsupervised problem of determining the edges of a bipartite graph that links the observed records to unobserved latent entities. Bayesian approaches provide attractive benefits, naturally providing uncertainty quantification via posterior probabilities. We propose a novel record linkage approach based on empirical Bayesian principles. Specifically, the empirical Bayesian-type step consists of taking the empirical distribution function of the data as the prior for the latent entities. This approach improves on the earlier HB approach not only by avoiding the prior specification problem but also by allowing both categorical and string-valued variables. Our extension to string-valued variables also involves the proposal of a new probabilistic mechanism by which observed record values for string fields can deviate from the values of their associated latent entities. Categorical fields that deviate from their corresponding true value are simply drawn from the empirical distribution function. We apply our proposed methodology to a simulated data set of German names and an Italian household survey on income and wealth, showing our method performs favorably compared to several standard methods in the literature. We also consider the robustness of our methods to changes in the hyper-parameters.",,"RECORD LINKAGE,GENERATION","Steorts, Rebecca C.@Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Steorts, Rebecca C.@Duke University",not exist,"A METHOD FOR CALIBRATING FALSE-MATCH RATES IN RECORD LINKAGE+BELIN, TR; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1995::A Latent Dirichlet Model for Unsupervised Entity Resolution+Bhattacharya, I.; Getoor, L.+SDM+2006::Random forests+Breiman, L+MACHINE LEARNING+OCT 2001::Variational Bayes for Merging Noisy Databases+Broderick, T.; Steorts, R.+arXiv:1410.4792+2014::Streaming variational Bayes+Broderick, T.; Boyd, N.; Wibisono, A.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Wilson, A.

Posterior Belief Assessment: Extracting Meaningful Subjective Judgements from Bayesian Analyses with Complex Statistical Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA966SI,DEC 2015,37,1,"In this paper, we are concerned with attributing meaning to the results of a Bayesian analysis for a problem which is sufficiently complex that we are unable to assert a precise correspondence between the expert probabilistic judgements of the analyst and the particular forms chosen for the prior specification and the likelihood for the analysis. In order to do this, we propose performing a finite collection of additional Bayesian analyses under alternative collections of prior and likelihood modelling judgements that we may also view as representative of our prior knowledge and the problem structure, and use these to compute posterior belief assessments for key quantities of interest. We show that these assessments are closer to our true underlying beliefs than the original Bayesian analysis and use the temporal sure preference principle to establish a probabilistic relationship between our true posterior judgements, our posterior belief assessment and our original Bayesian analysis to make this precise. We exploit second order exchangeability in order to generalise our approach to situations where there are infinitely many alternative Bayesian analyses we might consider as informative for our true judgements so that the method remains tractable even in these cases. We argue that posterior belief assessment is a tractable and powerful alternative to robust Bayesian analysis. We describe a methodology for computing posterior belief assessments in even the most complex of statistical models and illustrate with an example of calibrating an expensive ocean model in order to quantify uncertainty about global mean temperature in the real ocean.","prevision,subjective Bayes,temporal sure preference,Bayesian analysis,MCMC","CALIBRATION,UNCERTAINTY,DESIGNS","Williamson, Daniel@Univ Exeter, Stat Sci Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Exeter, Devon, England::Goldstein, Michael@Univ Durham, Dept Math Sci, Durham, England","Williamson, Daniel@University of Exeter::Goldstein, Michael@Durham University",not exist,"The effect of the nugget on Gaussian process emulators of computer models+Andiranakis, I.; Challenor, P.

Generalized Quantile Treatment Effect: A Flexible Bayesian Approach Using Quantile Ratio Smoothing,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/14-BA922,SEP 2015,35,0,"We propose a new general approach for estimating the effect of a binary treatment on a continuous and potentially highly skewed response variable, the generalized quantile treatment effect (GQTE). The GQTE is defined as the difference between a function of the quantiles under the two treatment conditions. As such, it represents a generalization over the standard approaches typically used for estimating a treatment effect (i.e., the average treatment effect and the quantile treatment effect) because it allows the comparison of any arbitrary characteristic of the outcome's distribution under the two treatments. Following Dominici et al. (2005), we assume that a pre-specified transformation of the two quantiles is modeled as a smooth function of the percentiles. This assumption allows us to link the two quantile functions and thus to borrow information from one distribution to the other. The main theoretical contribution we provide is the analytical derivation of a closed form expression for the likelihood of the model. Exploiting this result we propose a novel Bayesian inferential methodology for the GQTE. We show some finite sample properties of our approach through a simulation study which confirms that in some cases it performs better than other nonparametric methods. As an illustration we finally apply our methodology to the 1987 National Medicare Expenditure Survey data to estimate the difference in the single hospitalization medical cost distributions between cases (i.e., subjects affected by smoking attributable diseases) and controls.","average treatment effect (ATE),medical expenditures,National Medical Expenditures Survey (NMES),Q-Q plot,quantile function,quantile treatment effect (QTE),tailweight","MICRONUTRIENT SUPPLEMENTATION,BIRTH-WEIGHT,MODEL,DISTRIBUTIONS,REGRESSION","Venturini, Sergio@Univ Bocconi, CERGAS, I-20136 Milan, Italy::Dominici, Francesca@Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Boston, MA 02115 USA::Parmigiani, Giovanni@Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Boston, MA 02115 USA@Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Biostat & Computat Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Venturini, Sergio@Bocconi University::Dominici, Francesca@Harvard University::Parmigiani, Giovanni@Dana-Farber Cancer Institute@Harvard University@VA Boston Healthcare System",not exist,"Instrumental variables estimates of the effect of subsidized training on the quantiles of trainee earnings+Abadie, A; Angrist, J; Imbens, G+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 2002::Mostly Harmless Econometrics: An Empiricists Companion+Angrist, JD; Pischke, JS+MOSTLY HARMLESS ECONOMETRICS: AN EMPIRICISTS COMPANION+2009::Robust measures of tail weight+Brys, G; Hubert, M; Struyf, A+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+FEB 10 2006::no title+Cameron, C; Trivedi, P.+Microeconometrics+2005::Approaches for statistical inference+Carlin, Bradley P.; Louis, Thomas A.+BAYESIAN METHODS FOR DATA ANALYSIS, THIRD EDITION+2009::Nonparametric Bayes conditional distribution modeling with variable selection+Chen, Y.; Dunson, D.

Bayesian Tail Risk Interdependence Using Quantile Regression,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/14-BA911,SEP 2015,67,9,"Recent financial disasters emphasised the need to investigate the consequences associated with the tail co-movements among institutions; episodes of contagion are frequently observed and increase the probability of large losses affecting market participants' risk capital. Commonly used risk management tools fail to account for potential spillover effects among institutions because they only provide individual risk assessment. We contribute to the analysis of the interdependence effects of extreme events, providing an estimation tool for evaluating the co-movement Value-at-Risk. In particular, our approach relies on a Bayesian quantile regression framework. We propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, exploiting the representation of the Asymmetric Laplace distribution as a location-scale mixture of Normals. Moreover, since risk measures are usually evaluated on time series data and returns typically change over time, we extend the model to account for the dynamics of the tail behaviour. We apply our model to a sample of U. S. companies belonging to different sectors of the Standard and Poor's Composite Index and we provide an evaluation of the marginal contribution to the overall risk of each individual institution.","Bayesian quantile regression,time-varying conditional quantile,risk measures,state space models","ASYMMETRIC LAPLACE PROCESS,COLLAPSED GIBBS SAMPLERS,STATE-SPACE MODELS,SIMULATION SMOOTHER,SYSTEMIC RISK,DISTRIBUTIONS,FORECASTS","Bernardi, Mauro@Univ Roma La Sapienza, MEMOTEF Dept, Rome, Italy::Gayraud, Ghislaine@Univ Technol Compiegne, LMAC, Paris, France@LS CREST, Paris, France::Petrella, Lea@Univ Roma La Sapienza, MEMOTEF Dept, Rome, Italy","Bernardi, Mauro@Sapienza University Rome::Gayraud, Ghislaine@Universite de Technologie de Compiegne@Picardie Universites::Petrella, Lea@Sapienza University Rome",not exist,"Capital Shortfall: A New Approach to Ranking and Regulating Systemic Risks+Acharya, Viral; Engle, Robert; Richardson, Matthew+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+MAY 2012::Regulating Wall Street: The Dodd-Frank Act and the New Architecture of Global Finance+Acharya, VV; Cooley, TF; Richardson, M; et al.+REGULATING WALL STREET: THE DODD-FRANK ACT AND THE NEW ARCHITECTURE OF GLOBAL FINANCE+2011::Modeling spillover effects among financial institutions: a state-dependent sensitivity Value-at-Risk (SDSVaR) approach.+Adams, Z.; Fuss, R.; Gropp, R.+Working paper+2010::CoVaR.+Adrian, T.; Brunnermeier, M.+Working paper+2011::Multivariate Markov-switching models and tail risk interdependence+Bernardi, M.+arXiv. 1312.6407+2013::Interconnected risk contributions: a heavy-tail approach to analyse US financial sectors.+Bernardi, M.; Petrella, L.+arXiv. 1401.6408+2014::Skew mixture models for loss distributions: A Bayesian approach+Bernardi, Mauro; Maruotti, Antonello; Petrella, Lea+INSURANCE MATHEMATICS &amp; ECONOMICS+NOV 2012::Risk measures for skew normal mixtures+Bernardi, Mauro+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+AUG 2013::Econometric measures of connectedness and systemic risk in the finance and insurance sectors+Billio, Monica; Getmansky, Mila; Lo, Andrew W.; et al.+JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS+JUN 2012::Volatility, correlation and tails for systemic risk measurement.+Brownlees, C.; Engle, R.+Working paper+2012::Markov chain Monte Carlo in conditionally Gaussian state space models+Carter, CK; Kohn, R+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1996::ON GIBBS SAMPLING FOR STATE-SPACE MODELS+CARTER, CK; KOHN, R+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1994::Measuring and testing for the systemically important financial institutions+Castro, Carlos; Ferrari, Stijn+JOURNAL OF EMPIRICAL FINANCE+JAN 2014::Quantile Regression in Risk Calibration+Chao, S.-K.; Hardle, W.; Chang, W.+HDB FINANCIAL ECONOM+2012::Smooth Transition Quantile Capital Asset Pricing Models with Heteroscedasticity+Chen, Cathy W.

Bayesian Nonparametric Weighted Sampling Inference,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/14-BA924,SEP 2015,33,9,"It has historically been a challenge to perform Bayesian inference in a design-based survey context. The present paper develops a Bayesian model for sampling inference in the presence of inverse-probability weights. We use a hierarchical approach in which we model the distribution of the weights of the nonsampled units in the population and simultaneously include them as predictors in a nonparametric Gaussian process regression. We use simulation studies to evaluate the performance of our procedure and compare it to the classical design-based estimator. We apply our method to the Fragile Family and Child Wellbeing Study. Our studies find the Bayesian nonparametric finite population estimator to be more robust than the classical design-based estimator without loss in efficiency, which works because we induce regularization for small cells and thus this is a way of automatically smoothing the highly variable weights.","survey weighting,poststratification,model-based survey inference,Gaussian process prior,Stan","REGRESSION-MODELS,PUBLIC-OPINION,DISTRIBUTIONS,DESIGN","Si, Yajuan@Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biostat & Med Informat, Madison, WI 53706 USA@Univ Wisconsin, Dept Populat Hlth Sci, Madison, WI USA::Pillai, Natesh S.@Harvard Univ, Dept Stat, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA::Gelman, Andrew@Columbia Univ, Dept Stat, New York, NY USA@Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY USA","Si, Yajuan@University of Wisconsin System@University of Wisconsin Madison::Pillai, Natesh S.@Harvard University::Gelman, Andrew@Columbia University",not exist,"Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study: Methodology for constructing mother, father, and couple weights for core telephone surveys waves 1-4+Carlson, B.

Finite Sample Bernstein - von Mises Theorem for Semiparametric Problems,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/14-BA926,SEP 2015,30,2,"The classical parametric and semiparametric Bernstein - von Mises (BvM) results are reconsidered in a non-classical setup allowing finite samples and model misspecification. In the case of a finite dimensional nuisance parameter we obtain an upper bound on the error of Gaussian approximation of the posterior distribution for the target parameter which is explicit in the dimension of the nuisance and target parameters. This helps to identify the so called critical dimension p(n) of the full parameter for which the BvM result is applicable. In the important i.i.d. case, we show that the condition ""p(n)(3)/n is small"" is sufficient for the BvM result to be valid under general assumptions on the model. We also provide an example of a model with the phase transition effect: the statement of the BvM theorem fails when the dimension p(n) approaches n(1/3). The results are extended to the case of infinite dimensional parameters with the nuisance parameter from a Sobolev class.","prior,posterior,Bayesian inference,semiparametric,critical dimension","GAUSSIAN WHITE-NOISE,POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTIONS,ASYMPTOTIC NORMALITY,MODEL,PARAMETERS","Panov, Maxim@Datadvance Co, Moscow Inst Phys & Technol, Inst Informat Transmiss Problems RAS, Moscow 109028, Russia::Spokoiny, Vladimir@Weierstrass Inst, D-10117 Berlin, Germany@Humboldt Univ, Moscow Inst Phys & Technol, Inst Informat Transmiss Problems RAS, D-10117 Berlin, Germany","Panov, Maxim@Moscow Institute of Physics & Technology@Russian Academy of Sciences::Spokoiny, Vladimir@Humboldt University of Berlin@Weierstrass Institute for Applied Analysis & Stochastics","Panov, Maxim@A-5461-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5161-2822::Spokoiny, Vladimir@L-5441-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2040-3427","The consistency of posterior distributions in nonparametric problems+Barron, A; Schervish, MJ; Wasserman, L+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 1999::THE SEMIPARAMETRIC BERNSTEIN-VON MISES THEOREM+Bickel, P.

Optimal Design in Geostatistics under Preferential Sampling,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA944,SEP 2015,38,3,"This paper analyses the effect of preferential sampling in Geostatistics when the choice of new sampling locations is the main interest of the researcher. A Bayesian criterion based on maximizing utility functions is used. Simulated studies are presented and highlight the strong influence of preferential sampling in the decisions. The computational complexity is faced by treating the new local sampling locations as a model parameter and the optimal choice is then made by analysing its posterior distribution. Finally, an application is presented using rainfall data collected during spring in Rio de Janeiro. The results showed that the optimal design is substantially changed under preferential sampling effects. Furthermore, it was possible to identify other interesting aspects related to preferential sampling effects in estimation and prediction in Geostatistics.","optimal design,Geostatistics,preferential sampling,point process","GAUSSIAN COX PROCESSES,MONITORING NETWORKS,INFERENCE,POLLUTION","Ferreira, Gustavo da Silva@Brazilian Inst Geog & Stat, Natl Sch Stat Sci, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil::Gamerman, Dani@Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Math Inst, Dept Stat Methods, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil","Ferreira, Gustavo da Silva@Escola Nacional de Ciencias Estatisticas (ENCE)::Gamerman, Dani@Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro",not exist,"Beginning of the rainy season in southeastern Brazil: Part 1 - Observational studies+Alves, L.; Marengo, J.; Junior, H.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Castro, C</span>.+Revista Brasileira de Meteorologia+2005::Stationary process approximation for the analysis of large spatial datasets+Banerjee, Sudipto; Gelfand, Alan E.; Finley, Andrew O.; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2008::Modeling Nonstationary Processes Through Dimension Expansion+Bornn, Luke; Shaddick, Gavin; Zidek, James V.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2012::Learning heteroscedastic Gaussian processes for complex datasets+Boukouvalas, A.; Cornford, D.+Technical report+2009::Designing environmental monitoring networks to measure extremes+Chang, Howard; Fu, Audrey Qiuyan; Le, Nhu D.; et al.+ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL STATISTICS+SEP 2007::no title+Cressie, N.

"Compound Poisson Processes, Latent Shrinkage Priors and Bayesian Nonconvex Penalization",BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/14-BA892,JUN 2015,38,0,"In this paper we discuss Bayesian nonconvex penalization for sparse learning problems. We explore a nonparametric formulation for latent shrinkage parameters using subordinators which are one-dimensional Levy processes. We particularly study a family of continuous compound Poisson subordinators and a family of discrete compound Poisson subordinators. We exemplify four specific subordinators: Gamma, Poisson, negative binomial and squared Bessel subordinators. The Laplace exponents of the subordinators are Bernstein functions, so they can be used as sparsity-inducing nonconvex penalty functions. We exploit these subordinators in regression problems, yielding a hierarchical model with multiple regularization parameters. We devise ECME (Expectation/Conditional Maximization Either) algorithms to simultaneously estimate regression coefficients and regularization parameters.

Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Multiple Change-point Model,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/14-BA910,JUN 2015,22,1,"This paper proposes a new Bayesian multiple change-point model which is based on the hidden Markov approach. The Dirichlet process hidden Markov model does not require the specification of the number of change-points a priori. Hence our model is robust to model specification in contrast to the fully parametric Bayesian model. We propose a general Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm which only needs to sample the states around change-points. Simulations for a normal mean-shift model with known and unknown variance demonstrate advantages of our approach. Two applications, namely the coal-mining disaster data and the real United States Gross Domestic Product growth, are provided. We detect a single change-point for both the disaster data and US GDP growth. All the change-point locations and posterior inferences of the two applications are in line with existing methods.","Change-point,Dirichlet process,Hidden Markov model,Markov chain Monte Carlo,Nonparametric Bayesian","BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS,STRUCTURAL BREAKS,INFERENCE,TIME,MIXTURE","Ko, Stanley I.

Namely, given two sets of samples y((1)) <(iid) under tilde> F-(1) and y((2)) <(iid) under tilde> F-(2), with F-(1), F-(2) unknown, we wish to evaluate the evidence for the null hypothesis H-0 : F-(1) equivalent to F-(2) versus the alternative H-1 : F-(1) not equal F-(2). Our method is based upon a nonparametric Polya tree prior centered either subjectively or using an empirical procedure. We show that the Polya tree prior leads to an analytic expression for the marginal likelihood under the two hypotheses and hence an explicit measure of the probability of the null Pr(H-0 vertical bar{y((1)), y((2))}).","Bayesian nonparametrics,Polya tree,hypothesis testing","POLYA TREE DISTRIBUTIONS,MIXTURE-MODELS,INFERENCE,ALTERNATIVES,LIKELIHOOD","Holmes, Chris C.@Univ Oxford, Dept Stat, Oxford OX1 2JD, England@Univ Oxford, Oxford Man Inst, Oxford OX1 2JD, England::Caron, Francois@Univ Oxford, Dept Stat, Oxford OX1 2JD, England::Griffin, Jim E.@Univ Kent, Sch Math Stat & Actuarial Sci, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England::Stephens, David A.@McGill Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada","Holmes, Chris C.@University of Oxford::Caron, Francois@University of Oxford::Griffin, Jim E.@University of Kent::Stephens, David A.@McGill University",not exist,"Marginal likelihood and Bayes factors for Dirichlet process mixture models+Basu, S; Chib, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2003::Bayesian and conditional frequentist testing of a parametric model versus nonparametric alternatives+Berger, JO; Guglielmi, A+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2001::no title+Bernardo, J.

Sensitivity Analysis for Bayesian Hierarchical Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/14-BA909,JUN 2015,59,14,"Prior sensitivity examination plays an important role in applied Bayesian analyses. This is especially true for Bayesian hierarchical models, where interpretability of the parameters within deeper layers in the hierarchy becomes challenging. In addition, lack of information together with identifiability issues may imply that the prior distributions for such models have an undesired influence on the posterior inference. Despite its importance, informal approaches to prior sensitivity analysis are currently used. They require repetitive re-fits of the model with ad-hoc modified base prior parameter values. Other formal approaches to prior sensitivity analysis suffer from a lack of popularity in practice, mainly due to their high computational cost and absence of software implementation. We propose a novel formal approach to prior sensitivity analysis, which is fast and accurate. It quantifies sensitivity without the need for a model re-fit. Through a series of examples we show how our approach can be used to detect high prior sensitivities of some parameters as well as identifiability issues in possibly over-parametrized Bayesian hierarchical models.","Base prior,formal local sensitivity measure,Bayesian robustness,calibration,Hellinger distance,Bayesian hierarchical models,identifiability,overparametrisation","LINEAR MIXED MODELS,LOCAL INFLUENCE,MARGINAL DENSITIES,INFERENCE,APPROXIMATIONS,PERTURBATION","Roos, Malgorzata@Univ Zurich, Inst Social & Prevent Med, Div Biostat, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland::Martins, Thiago G.@Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Math Sci, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway::Held, Leonhard@Univ Zurich, Inst Social & Prevent Med, Div Biostat, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland::Rue, Havard@Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Math Sci, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway","Roos, Malgorzata@University of Zurich::Martins, Thiago G.@Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU)@Norwegian University of Science & Technology::Held, Leonhard@University of Zurich::Rue, Havard@Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU)@Norwegian University of Science & Technology","Held, Leonhard@E-8159-2010","no title+Amari, S.; Nagaoka, H.+Methods of Information Geometry+2000::Differential- Geometrical Methods in Statistics+Amari, S.+LECT NOTES STAT+1990::Scheveningen: A successful case of revitalisation+Bergsma, J.; de Haan, T.+Resort management in Europe: Case studies and learning materials+2000::BAYESIAN IMAGE-RESTORATION, WITH 2 APPLICATIONS IN SPATIAL STATISTICS+BESAG, J; YORK, J; MOLLIE, A+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+MAR 1991::On a measure of divergence between two statistical populations defined by their probability distributions+Bhattacharyya, A.+Bulletin of the Calcutta Mathematical Society+09 1943::SAMPLING AND BAYES INFERENCE IN SCIENTIFIC MODELING AND ROBUSTNESS+BOX, GEP+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1980::Approximate inference in generalized linear mixed models.+Breslow, N.

In the Bayesian literature, graphs are often determined through the use of priors over the space of positive definite matrices with fixed zeros, but these methods present daunting computational burdens in large problems. Motivated by the superior computational efficiency of continuous shrinkage priors for regression analysis, we propose a new framework for structure learning that is based on continuous spike and slab priors and uses latent variables to identify graphs.

Predictions Based on the Clustering of Heterogeneous Functions via Shape and Subject-Specific Covariates,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/14-BA919,JUN 2015,36,2,"We consider a study of players employed by teams who are members of the National Basketball Association where units of observation are functional curves that are realizations of production measurements taken through the course of one's career. The observed functional output displays large amounts of between player heterogeneity in the sense that some individuals produce curves that are fairly smooth while others are (much) more erratic. We argue that this variability in curve shape is a feature that can be exploited to guide decision making, learn about processes under study and improve prediction. In this paper we develop a methodology that takes advantage of this feature when clustering functional curves. Individual curves are flexibly modeled using Bayesian penalized B-splines while a hierarchical structure allows the clustering to be guided by the smoothness of individual curves. In a sense, the hierarchical structure balances the desire to fit individual curves well while still producing meaningful clusters that are used to guide prediction. We seamlessly incorporate available covariate information to guide the clustering of curves non-parametrically through the use of a product partition model prior for a random partition of individuals. Clustering based on curve smoothness and subject-specific covariate information is particularly important in carrying out the two types of predictions that are of interest, those that complete a partially observed curve from an active player, and those that predict the entire career curve for a player yet to play in the National Basketball Association.","Product partition models,Nonparametric Bayes,Penalized splines,Hierarchical models,Right censored data,NBA player production curves","PRODUCT PARTITION MODEL,REGRESSION SPLINES,DISTRIBUTIONS,MIXTURE","Page, Garritt L.@Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Estadist, Santiago, Chile::Quintana, Fernando A.@Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Estadist, Santiago, Chile","Page, Garritt L.@Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile::Quintana, Fernando A.@Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile",not exist,"Hierarchical models for assessing variability among functions+Behseta, S; Kass, RE; Wallstrom, GL+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 2005::Bridging different eras in sports+Berry, SM; Reese, CS; Larkey, PD+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1999::Bayesian adaptive regression splines for hierarchical data+Bigelow, Jamie L.; Dunson, David B.+BIOMETRICS+SEP 2007::Adaptive Bayesian regression splines in semiparametric generalized linear models+Biller, C+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+MAR 2000::FERGUSON DISTRIBUTIONS VIA POLYA URN SCHEMES+BLACKWELL, D; MACQUEEN, JB+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1973::no title+Collins,, L.

Approximate Bayesian Computation by Modelling Summary Statistics in a Quasi-likelihood Framework,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/14-BA921,JUN 2015,58,2,"Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is a useful class of methods for Bayesian inference when the likelihood function is computationally intractable. In practice, the basic ABC algorithm may be inefficient in the presence of discrepancy between prior and posterior. Therefore, more elaborate methods, such as ABC with the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm (ABC-MCMC), should be used. However, the elaboration of a proposal density for MCMC is a sensitive issue and very difficult in the ABC setting, where the likelihood is intractable. We discuss an automatic proposal distribution useful for ABC-MCMC algorithms. This proposal is inspired by the theory of quasi-likelihood (QL) functions and is obtained by modelling the distribution of the summary statistics as a function of the parameters. Essentially, given a real-valued vector of summary statistics, we reparametrize the model by means of a regression function of the statistics on parameters, obtained by sampling from the original model in a pilot-run simulation study. The QL theory is well established for a scalar parameter, and it is shown that when the conditional variance of the summary statistic is assumed constant, the QL has a closed-form normal density. This idea of constructing proposal distributions is extended to non constant variance and to real-valued parameter vectors. The method is illustrated by several examples and by an application to a real problem in population genetics.","Estimating function,Likelihood-free methods,Markov chain Monte Carlo,Proposal distribution,Pseudo-likelihood","MONTE-CARLO,PROFILE LIKELIHOODS,INDIRECT INFERENCE,SELECTION,DISTRIBUTIONS,ALGORITHMS,PARAMETERS,HASTINGS,SYSTEMS,RATES","Cabras, Stefano@Univ Cagliari, Dept Math, Cagliari, Italy@Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Stat, Madrid, Spain::Castellanos Nueda, Maria Eugenia@Unknow::Ruli, Erlis@Univ Padua, Dept Stat, Padua, Italy","Cabras, Stefano@Universidad Carlos III de Madrid@University of Cagliari::Castellanos Nueda, Maria Eugenia@Unknow::Ruli, Erlis@University of Padua","Castellanos, Maria Eugenia@E-9851-2016@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7920-2307::ruli, erlis@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8572-2149","Quasi-profile loglikelihoods for unbiased estimating functions+Adimari, G; Ventura, L+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+JUN 2002::A Novel Approach for Choosing Summary Statistics in Approximate Bayesian Computation+Aeschbacher, Simon; Beaumont, Mark A.; Futschik, Andreas+GENETICS+NOV 2012::THE PSEUDO-MARGINAL APPROACH FOR EFFICIENT MONTE CARLO COMPUTATIONS+Andrieu, Christophe; Roberts, Gareth O.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2009::On the geometric ergodicity of Metropolis-Hastings algorithms+Atchade, Yves F.; Perron, Francois+STATISTICS+FEB 2007::QUASI PROFILE AND DIRECTED LIKELIHOODS FROM ESTIMATING FUNCTIONS+BARNDORFFNIELSEN, OE+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+SEP 1995::Considerate approaches to constructing summary statistics for ABC model selection+Barnes, Chris P.; Filippi, Sarah; Stumpf, Michael P.

Searching Multiregression Dynamic Models of Resting-State fMRI Networks Using Integer Programming,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/14-BA913,JUN 2015,73,5,"A Multiregression Dynamic Model (MDM) is a class of multivariate time series that represents various dynamic causal processes in a graphical way. One of the advantages of this class is that, in contrast to many other Dynamic Bayesian Networks, the hypothesised relationships accommodate conditional conjugate inference. We demonstrate for the first time how straightforward it is to search over all possible connectivity networks with dynamically changing intensity of transmission to find the Maximum a Posteriori Probability (MAP) model within this class. This search method is made feasible by using a novel application of an Integer Programming algorithm. The efficacy of applying this particular class of dynamic models to this domain is shown and more specifically the computational efficiency of a corresponding search of 11-node Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) model space. We proceed to show how diagnostic methods, analogous to those defined for static Bayesian Networks, can be used to suggest embellishment of the model class to extend the process of model selection. All methods are illustrated using simulated and real resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data.","Multiregression Dynamic Model,Bayesian Network,Integer Program Algorithm,Model Selection,Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)","DIRECTED ACYCLIC GRAPHS,EFFECTIVE CONNECTIVITY,BRAIN CONNECTIVITY,BAYESIAN-APPROACH,FUNCTIONAL MRI,TRAFFIC FLOWS,CAUSALITY,SYSTEMS,VALIDATION,ALGORITHM","Costa, Lilia@Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England@Univ Fed Bahia, BR-41170290 Salvador, BA, Brazil::Smith, Jim@Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England::Nichols, Thomas@Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England::Cussens, James@Univ York, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England::Duff, Eugene P.@Univ Oxford, FMRIB Ctr, Oxford OX1 2JD, England::Makin, Tamar R.@Univ Oxford, FMRIB Ctr, Oxford OX1 2JD, England","Costa, Lilia@University of Warwick@Universidade Federal da Bahia::Smith, Jim@University of Warwick::Nichols, Thomas@University of Warwick::Cussens, James@University of York - UK::Duff, Eugene P.@University of Oxford::Makin, Tamar R.@University of Oxford","Duff, Eugene@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8795-5472::Cussens, James@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1363-2336","no title+ACHTERBERG T+THESIS TU BERLIN+2007::MARKOV EQUIVALENCE FOR ANCESTRAL GRAPHS+Ali, R.

Bayesian Model Selection Based on Proper Scoring Rules,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/15-BA942,JUN 2015,24,2,"Bayesian model selection with improper priors is not well-defined because of the dependence of the marginal likelihood on the arbitrary scaling constants of the within-model prior densities. We show how this problem can be evaded by replacing marginal log-likelihood by a homogeneous proper scoring rule, which is insensitive to the scaling constants. Suitably applied, this will typically enable consistent selection of the true model.","consistent model selection,homogeneous score,Hyvarinen score,prequential",,"Dawid, A.

Bayesian Model Choice in Cumulative Link Ordinal Regression Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/14-BA884,MAR 2015,62,2,"The use of the proportional odds (PO) model for ordinal regression is ubiquitous in the literature. If the assumption of parallel lines does not hold for the data, then an alternative is to specify a non-proportional odds (NPO) model, where the regression parameters are allowed to vary depending on the level of the response. However, it is often difficult to fit these models, and challenges regarding model choice and fitting are further compounded if there are a large number of explanatory variables. We make two contributions towards tackling these issues: firstly, we develop a Bayesian method for fitting these models, that ensures the stochastic ordering conditions hold for an arbitrary finite range of the explanatory variables, allowing NPO models to be fitted to any observed data set. Secondly, we use reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo to allow the model to choose between PO and NPO structures for each explanatory variable, and show how variable selection can be incorporated. These methods can be adapted for any monotonic increasing link functions. We illustrate the utility of these approaches on novel data from a longitudinal study of individual-level risk factors affecting body condition score in a dog population in Zenzele, South Africa.","Bayesian inference,ordinal regression,Markov chain Monte Carlo,reversible-jump,Bayesian model choice","CHAIN MONTE-CARLO,MIXED-EFFECTS MODELS,LOGISTIC-REGRESSION,VARIABLE SELECTION,BINARY,MCMC,ODDS,HEALTH","McKinley, Trevelyan J.@Univ Cambridge, Dept Vet Med, Dis Dynam Unit, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England::Morters, Michelle@Univ Cambridge, Dept Vet Med, Dis Dynam Unit, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England::Wood, James L.

Asymptotic Properties of Bayesian Predictive Densities When the Distributions of Data and Target Variables are Different,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/14-BA886,MAR 2015,19,7,"Bayesian predictive densities when the observed data x and the target variable y to be predicted have different distributions are investigated by using the framework of information geometry. The performance of predictive densities is evaluated by the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The parametric models are formulated as Riemannian manifolds. In the conventional setting in which x and y have the same distribution, the Fisher-Rao metric and the Jeffreys prior play essential roles. In the present setting in which x and y have different distributions, a new metric, which we call the predictive metric, constructed by using the Fisher information matrices of x and y, and the volume element based on the predictive metric play the corresponding roles. It is shown that Bayesian predictive densities based on priors constructed by using non-constant positive superharmonic functions with respect to the predictive metric asymptotically dominate those based on the volume element prior of the predictive metric.","differential geometry,Fisher-Rao metric,Jeffreys prior,Kullback-Leibler divergence,predictive metric","SHRINKAGE PRIORS,OBSERVABLES,REGRESSION","Komaki, Fumiyasu@Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Dept Math Informat, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138656, Japan@RIKEN Brain Sci Inst, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan","Komaki, Fumiyasu@RIKEN@University of Tokyo",not exist,"no title+Aitchison, J.; Dunsmore, I.

Power-Expected-Posterior Priors for Variable Selection in Gaussian Linear Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/14-BA887,MAR 2015,34,10,"In the context of the expected-posterior prior (EPP) approach to Bayesian variable selection in linear models, we combine ideas from power-prior and unit-information-prior methodologies to simultaneously (a) produce a minimally-informative prior and (b) diminish the effect of training samples. The result is that in practice our power-expected-posterior (PEP) methodology is sufficiently insensitive to the size n* of the training sample, due to PEP's unit-information construction, that one may take n* equal to the full-data sample size n and dispense with training samples altogether. This promotes stability of the resulting Bayes factors, removes the arbitrariness arising from individual training-sample selections, and greatly increases computational speed, allowing many more models to be compared within a fixed CPU budget. We find that, under an independence Jeffreys (reference) baseline prior, the asymptotics of PEP Bayes factors are equivalent to those of Schwartz's Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), ensuring consistency of the PEP approach to model selection. Our PEP prior, due to its unit-information structure, leads to a variable-selection procedure that in our empirical studies -(1) is systematically more parsimonious than the basic EPP with minimal training sample, while sacrificing no desirable performance characteristics to achieve this parsimony; (2) is robust to the size of the training sample, thus enjoying the advantages described above arising from the avoidance of training samples altogether; and (3) identifies maximum-a-posteriori models that achieve better out-of-sample predictive performance than that provided by standard EPPs, the g-prior, the hyper-g prior, non-local priors, the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and Smoothly-Clipped Absolute Deviation (SCAD) methods.","Bayesian variable selection,Bayes factors,Consistency,Expected-posterior priors,Gaussian linear models,g-prior,Hyper-g prior,LASSO,Nonlocal priors,Prior compatibility,Power-prior,Training samples,SCAD,Unit-information prior","PRIOR DISTRIBUTIONS,REGRESSION-MODELS,BAYES FACTORS","Fouskakis, Dimitris@Natl Tech Univ Athens, GR-10682 Athens, Greece::Ntzoufras, Ioannis@Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece::Draper, David@Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA@Ebay Res Labs, San Jose, CA USA","Fouskakis, Dimitris@National Technical University of Athens::Ntzoufras, Ioannis@Athens University of Economics & Business::Draper, David@University of California Santa Cruz@University of California System",not exist,"POSTERIOR BAYES FACTORS+AITKIN, M+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1991::Optimal predictive model selection+Barbieri, MM; Berger, JO+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2004::The intrinsic Bayes factor for linear models+Berger, J.; Pericchi, L.+Bayesian Statistics+1996::Training samples in objective Bayesian model selection+Berger, JO; Pericchi, LR+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2004::The intrinsic Bayes factor for model selection and prediction+Berger, JO; Pericchi, LR+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1996::ESTIMATING OPTIMAL TRANSFORMATIONS FOR MULTIPLE-REGRESSION AND CORRELATION+BREIMAN, L; FRIEDMAN, JH+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1985::Objective Bayesian variable selection+Casella, G; Moreno, E+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2006::CONSISTENCY OF BAYESIAN PROCEDURES FOR VARIABLE SELECTION+Casella, George; Giron, F.

Bayesian Structure Learning in Sparse Gaussian Graphical Models,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/14-BA889,MAR 2015,53,16,"Decoding complex relationships among large numbers of variables with relatively few observations is one of the crucial issues in science. One approach to this problem is Gaussian graphical modeling, which describes conditional independence of variables through the presence or absence of edges in the underlying graph. In this paper, we introduce a novel and efficient Bayesian framework for Gaussian graphical model determination which is a trans-dimensional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach based on a continuous-time birth-death process. We cover the theory and computational details of the method. It is easy to implement and computationally feasible for high-dimensional graphs. We show our method outperforms alternative Bayesian approaches in terms of convergence, mixing in the graph space and computing time. Unlike frequentist approaches, it gives a principled and, in practice, sensible approach for structure learning. We illustrate the efficiency of the method on a broad range of simulated data. We then apply the method on large-scale real applications from human and mammary gland gene expression studies to show its empirical usefulness. In addition, we implemented the method in the R package BDgraph which is freely available at http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BDgraph.","Bayesian model selection,Sparse Gaussian graphical models,Non-decomposable graphs,Birth-death process,Markov chain Monte Carlo,G-Wishart","REVERSIBLE JUMP,COVARIANCE-SELECTION,DECOMPOSABLE GRAPHS,INFERENCE,LASSO,DISTRIBUTIONS,COMPUTATION,LIKELIHOOD,NETWORKS","Mohammadi, A.@Univ Groningen, Dept Stat, Groningen, Netherlands::Wit, E.

We derive the functional forms of the posterior distributions of the risk difference and the risk ratio and discuss how to sample from their posterior distributions.

Sequential Monte Carlo with Adaptive Weights for Approximate Bayesian Computation,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/14-BA891,MAR 2015,34,8,"Methods of approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) are increasingly used for analysis of complex models. A major challenge for ABC is overcoming the often inherent problem of high rejection rates in the accept/reject methods based on prior: predictive sampling. A number of recent developments aim to address this with extensions based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) strategies. We build on this here, introducing an ABC SMC method that uses data-based adaptive weights. This easily implemented and computationally trivial extension of ABC SMC can very substantially improve acceptance rates, as is demonstrated in a series of examples with simulated and real data sets, including a currently topical example from dynamic modelling in systems biology applications.","complex modelling,adaptive simulation,dynamic bionetwork models,importance sampling,mixture model emulators","DYNAMICAL-SYSTEMS,MODEL SELECTION,LIKELIHOODS,INFERENCE","Bonassi, Fernando V.@Google Inc, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA@Duke Univ, Stat Sci, Durham, NC 27706 USA::West, Mike@Duke Univ, Durham, NC USA","Bonassi, Fernando V.@Google Incorporated@Duke University::West, Mike@Duke University",not exist,"Approximate Bayesian computation in population genetics+Beaumont, MA; Zhang, WY; Balding, DJ+GENETICS+DEC 2002::Adaptive approximate Bayesian computation+Beaumont, Mark A.; Cornuet, Jean-Marie; Marin, Jean-Michel; et al.+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 2009::Non-linear regression models for Approximate Bayesian Computation+Blum, Michael G.

Overall Objective Priors,BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,10.1214/14-BA915,MAR 2015,48,20,"In multi-parameter models, reference priors typically depend on the parameter or quantity of interest, and it is well known that this is necessary to produce objective posterior distributions with optimal properties. There are, however, many situations where one is simultaneously interested in all the parameters of the model or, more realistically, in functions of them that include aspects such as prediction, and it would then be useful to have a single objective prior that could safely be used to produce reasonable posterior inferences for all the quantities of interest. In this paper, we consider three methods for selecting a single objective prior and study, in a variety of problems including the multinomial problem, whether or not the resulting prior is a reasonable overall prior.","Joint Reference Prior,Logarithmic Divergence,Multinomial Model,Objective Priors,Reference Analysis","2-PARAMETER EXPONENTIAL FAMILY,BAYESIAN-INFERENCE,FREQUENTIST VALIDITY,PRIOR DISTRIBUTIONS,POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTIONS,PARTIAL INFORMATION,SELECTION,VARIANCE,MODELS","Berger, James O.@Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA@King Abdulaziz Univ, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia::Bernardo, Jose M.@Univ Valencia, E-46003 Valencia, Spain::Sun, Dongchu@Univ Missouri Columbia, Columbia, MO USA","Berger, James O.@Duke University@King Abdulaziz University::Bernardo, Jose M.@University of Valencia::Sun, Dongchu@University of Missouri Columbia@University of Missouri System",not exist,"AN EXPONENTIAL SUBFAMILY WHICH ADMITS UMPU TESTS BASED ON A SINGLE TEST STATISTIC+BARLEV, SK; REISER, B+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1982::On the development of the reference prior method+Berger, J O; Bernardo, J M.+Bayesian Stat.+1992::THE FORMAL DEFINITION OF REFERENCE PRIORS+Berger, James O.; Bernardo, Jose M.; Sun, Dongchu+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2009::Objective priors for the bivariate normal model+Berger, James O.; Sun, Dongchu+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2008::Objective Priors for Discrete Parameter Spaces+Berger, James O.; Bernardo, Jose M.; Sun, Dongchu+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2012::ORDERED GROUP REFERENCE PRIORS WITH APPLICATION TO THE MULTINOMIAL PROBLEM+BERGER, JO; BERNARDO, JM+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1992::ESTIMATING A PRODUCT OF MEANS - BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS WITH REFERENCE PRIORS+BERGER, JO; BERNARDO, JM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1989::Intrinsic point estimation of the normal variance+Bernardo, J M.+Bayesian Statistics and Its Applications+2006::no title+Bernardo, J.
