A measure of representativeness of a sample for inferential purposes,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2006.tb00166.x,AUG 2006,9,4,"After defining the concept of representativeness of a random sample, the author proposes a measure of how much the observed sample represents its parent distribution. This measure is called Representativeness Index. The same measure, seen as a function of a sample and of a distribution, will be called Representativeness Function. For a given sample it provides the value of the index for the different distributions under examination, and for a given distribution it provides a measure of the representativeness of its possible samples. Such Representativeness Function can be used in an inferential framework just as the likelihood function, since it gives to any distribution the ""experimental support"" provided by the observed sample. This measure is distribution-free and it is shown to be a transformation of the well-known Cramer-von Mises statistic. By using the properties of that statistic, criteria for providing set estimators and tests of hypotheses are introduced. The utilization of the representativeness function in many standard statistical problems is outlined through examples. The quality of the inferential decisions can be assessed with the usual techniques (MSE, power function, coverage probabilities). The most interesting examples turn out to be those of situations that are ""non-regular"", as for instance the estimation of parameters involved in the support of the parent distribution, or less explored (model choice).","representativeness function,parameter estimation,test of hypotheses,prediction distribution,Cramer-von Mises statistic,model choice",,"Bertino, Salvatore@Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Stat Probabil & Stat Applicate, I-00185 Rome, Italy","Bertino, Salvatore@Sapienza University Rome",not exist,"ASYMPTOTIC THEORY OF CERTAIN GOODNESS OF FIT CRITERIA BASED ON STOCHASTIC PROCESSES+ANDERSON, TW; DARLING, DA+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1952::no title+BERTINO S+ATT 39 RIUN SCI SIS+1998::no title+BERTINO S+PUBBLICAZIONI U ROMA+1971::The exact and asymptotic distributions of Cramer-von Mises statistics+Csorgo, S; Faraway, JJ+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1996::Sugli estremi dei momenti delle funzioni di ripartizione doppia+DallAglio, G.+Ann.

Estimation optimality of corrected AIC and modified Cp in linear regression,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2006.tb00167.x,AUG 2006,9,20,"Model selection criteria often arise by constructing unbiased or approximately unbiased estimators of measures known as expected overall discrepancies (Linhart & Zucchini, 1986, p. 19). Such measures quantify the disparity between the true model (i.e., the model which generated the observed data) and a fitted candidate model. For linear regression with normally distributed error terms, the ""corrected"" Akaike information criterion and the ""modified"" conceptual predictive statistic have been proposed as exactly unbiased estimators of their respective target discrepancies. We expand on previous work to additionally show that these criteria achieve minimum variance within the class of unbiased estimators.","AICc,Gauss discrepancy,Kullback-Leibler discrepancy,MCp,model selection criteria",,"Daviesl, Simon L.@So Illinois Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA@Pfizer Global Pharmaceut Inc, New York, NY USA@Univ Iowa, Dept Biostat, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA::Neath, Andrew A.@So Illinois Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA@Pfizer Global Pharmaceut Inc, New York, NY USA@Univ Iowa, Dept Biostat, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA::Cavanaugh, Joseph E.@So Illinois Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA@Pfizer Global Pharmaceut Inc, New York, NY USA@Univ Iowa, Dept Biostat, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA","Daviesl, Simon L.@Southern Illinois University Edwardsville@Southern Illinois University System@Pfizer@University of Iowa::Neath, Andrew A.@Southern Illinois University Edwardsville@Southern Illinois University System@Pfizer@University of Iowa::Cavanaugh, Joseph E.@Southern Illinois University Edwardsville@Southern Illinois University System@Pfizer@University of Iowa",not exist,"NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::Information theory and extension of the maximum likelihood principle+Akaike, H.+2 INT S INF THEOR+1973::no title+Christensen, R.+Plane Answers to Complex Questions: The Theory of Linear Models+1996::Modified AIC and C-p in multivariate linear regression+Fujikoshi, Y; Satoh, K+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1997::REGRESSION AND TIME-SERIES MODEL SELECTION IN SMALL SAMPLES+HURVICH, CM; TSAI, CL+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1989::no title+Kullback, S.+Information Theory and Statistics+1968::no title+Linhart, H.; Zucchini, W.+Model Selection+1986::SOME COMMENTS ON CP+MALLOWS, CL+TECHNOMETRICS+1973::FURTHER ANALYSIS OF DATA BY AKAIKES INFORMATION CRITERION AND FINITE CORRECTIONS+SUGIURA, N+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS PART A-THEORY AND METHODS+1978"
Statistical proofs of some matrix theorems,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2006.tb00168.x,AUG 2006,24,3,"Books on linear models and multivariate analysis generally include a chapter on matrix algebra, quite rightly so, as matrix results are used in the discussion of statistical methods in these areas. During recent years a number of papers have appeared where statistical results derived without the use of matrix theorems have been used to prove some matrix results which are used to generate other statistical results. This may have some pedagogical value. It is not, however, suggested that prior knowledge of matrix theory is not necessary for studying statistics. It is intended to show that a judicious use of statistical and matrix results might be of help in providing elegant proofs of problems both in statistics and matrix algebra and make the study of both the subjects somewhat interesting. Some basic notions of vector spaces and matrices are, however, necessary and these are outlined in the introduction to this paper.","Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,Fisher information,Kronecker product,Milne's inequality,parallel sum of matrices,Schur product","FISHER INFORMATION,SUPERADDITIVITY,INEQUALITIES","Rao, C.

In this paper, comparison between the most common schemes is performed in terms of different efficiency criteria, including efficiency ratio and processing time.

A comparison of nonparametric methods in the graduation of mortality: Application to data from the Valencia Region (Spain),INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2006.tb00171.x,AUG 2006,49,18,"The nonparametric graduation of mortality data aims to estimate death rates by carrying out a smoothing of the crude rates obtained directly from original data. The main difference with regard to parametric models is that the assumption of an age-dependent function is unnecessary, which is advantageous when the information behind the model is unknown, as one cause of error is often the choice of an inappropriate model. This paper reviews the various alternatives and presents their application to mortality data from the Valencia Region, Spain. The comparison leads us to the conclusion that the best model is a smoothing by means of Generalised Additive Models (GAM) with splines. The most interesting part of this paper is the development of a plan that can be applied to mortality data for a wide range of age groups in any geographical area, allowing the most appropriate table to be chosen for the data in hand.","GAM,kernel smoothing,life tables,LOESS,splines","REGRESSION,CHOICE,PREDICTIONS","Debon, Ana@Univ Politecn Valencia, E-46022 Valencia, Spain@Univ Valencia, E-46003 Valencia, Spain::Montes, Francisco@Univ Politecn Valencia, E-46022 Valencia, Spain@Univ Valencia, E-46003 Valencia, Spain::Sala, Ramon@Univ Politecn Valencia, E-46022 Valencia, Spain@Univ Valencia, E-46003 Valencia, Spain","Debon, Ana@Universitat Politecnica de Valencia@University of Valencia::Montes, Francisco@Universitat Politecnica de Valencia@University of Valencia::Sala, Ramon@Universitat Politecnica de Valencia@University of Valencia",not exist,"no title+Benjamin, B.; Pollard, J.+The Analysis of Mortality and other Actuarial Stayistics+1992::no title+BETZUEN A+APROACH PEOPLES EMPL+1997::Graduation: Some Experiments With Kernel Methods+Bloomfield, DSF; Haberman, S.+Journal of the Institute of Actuaries+1987::COMPARING AUTOMATIC SMOOTHERS - (A PUBLIC-SERVICE ENTERPRISE)+BREIMAN, L; PETERS, S+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+DEC 1992::LOCALLY ADAPTIVE BANDWIDTH CHOICE FOR KERNEL REGRESSION-ESTIMATORS+BROCKMANN, M; GASSER, T; HERRMANN, E+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1993::Applications of linear and quadratic programming to some cases of the Whittaker-Henderson graduation method+Chan, F.

Stochastic index numbers: A review,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2006.tb00172.x,AUG 2006,76,14,"The stochastic approach is a new way of viewing index numbers in which uncertainty and statistical ideas play a central role. Rather than just providing a single number for the rate of inflation, the stochastic approach provides the whole probability distribution of inflation. This paper reviews the key elements of the approach and then discusses its early history, including some previously overlooked links with Fisher's work contained in his book The Making of Index Numbers. We then consider some more recent developments, including Diewert's well-known critique of the stochastic approach, and provide responses to his criticisms. We also provide a review of Theil's work on the stochastic approach, and present and extend Diewert's work on this topic within the context of the Country Product Dummy method which measures price levels internationally. The paper also contains some recent material on the value of information from the perspective of the stochastic approach, as well as illustrative applications.","index numbers,stochastic approach,measurement of inflation","PURCHASING-POWER PARITY,STANDARD ERRORS,CONSTRUCTION,COUNTRIES,PRECISION,PRICES","Clements, Kenneth W.@Univ Western Australia, Sch Business, Crawley, WA, Australia@Griffith Univ, Sch Int Business, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia::Izan, H.

This method, perturbation of unsafe combinations (Peruco), eliminates unsafe combinations in the records in which they occur, by replacing them with safe combinations that are also consistent with the other values in the remainder of the records. Consistency is relative to a set of micro-edits that is supposed to be given along with the microdata. A deterministic optimization model is discussed, as well as possible extensions.","statistical disclosure control,microdata,micro-edits,consistency,data transformation",DISCLOSURE CONTROL,"Willenborg, Leon@Stat Netherlands, Voorburg, Netherlands@Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands::van den Hout, Ardo@Stat Netherlands, Voorburg, Netherlands@Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands","Willenborg, Leon@Unknow@Utrecht University::van den Hout, Ardo@Unknow@Utrecht University",not exist,"DISCLOSURE CONTROL OF MICRODATA+BETHLEHEM, JG; KELLER, WJ; PANNEKOEK, J+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1990::Conflict between the needs for access to statistical information and demands for confidentiality+Fienberg, S.+J.

Critique of p-Values,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2006.tb00157.x,APR 2006,36,1,"This paper generalizes the notion of p-value to obtain a system for assessing evidence in favor of an hypothesis. It is not quite a quantification in that evidence is a pair of numbers (the p-value and the p-value with null and alternative interchanged) with evidence for the alternative being claimed when the first number is small and the second is at least moderately large. Traditional significance tests present p-values as a measure of evidence against a theory. This usage is rarely called for since scientists usually wish to accept theories (for the time being) not just not reject them; they are more interested in evidence for a theory. P-values are not just good or bad for this purpose; their efficacy depends on specifics. We find that a single p-value does not measure evidence for a simple hypothesis relative to a simple alternative, but consideration of both p-values leads to a satisfactory theory. This consideration does not, in general, extend to composite hypotheses since there, best evidence calls for optimization of a bivariate objective function. But in some cases, notably one sided tests for the exponential family, the optimization can be solved, and a single p-value does provide an appealing measure of best evidence for a hypothesis. One possible extension of this theory is proposed and illustrated with a practical safety analysis problem involving the difference of two random variables.","p-value : Exponential family,resolving disagreement,evidence for a theory,safety analysis","SIGNIFICANCE TESTS,FREQUENTIST,HYPOTHESES,STATISTICS,INFERENCE,MODELS,PRIORS","Thompson, B@Univ Missouri, Dept Stat, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Thompson, B@University of Missouri Columbia@University of Missouri System",not exist,"no title+BARNARD G+J ROYAL STAT SOC A+1980::Bayesian and conditional frequentist testing of a parametric model versus nonparametric alternatives+Berger, JO; Guglielmi, A+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2001::TESTING A POINT NULL HYPOTHESIS - THE IRRECONCILABILITY OF P-VALUES AND EVIDENCE+BERGER, JO; SELLKE, T+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1987::no title+Berger, JO; Wolpert, RL.+The likelihood principle+1984::Tests of significance considered as evidence+Berkson, J+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1942::no title+Cox, D.

Smoothing observational data: A philosophy and implementation for the health sciences,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2006.tb00159.x,APR 2006,64,6,"Standard statistical methods (such as regression analysis) presume the data are generated by an identifiable random process, and attempt to model that process in a parsimonious fashion. In contrast, observational data in the health sciences are generated by complex, nonidentified, and largely nonrandom mechanisms, and are analyzed to form inferences on latent structures. Despite this gap between the methods and reality, most observational data analysis comprises application of standard methods, followed by narrative discussion of the problems of entailed by doing so. Alternative approaches employ latent-structure models that include components for nonidentified mechanisms. Standard methods can still be useful, however, provided their modeling philosophy is modified to encourage preservation of structure, rather than achieving parsimonious description. With this modification they can be viewed as smoothing or filtering methods for separating noise from signal before the task of latent-structure modeling begins. I here give a detailed justification of this view, and a hierarchical-modeling implementation that can be carried out with popular software. Concepts are illustrated in the smoothing of a contingency table from an analysis of magnetic fields and childhood leukemia.","bias,empirical Bayes,epidemiologic methods,hierarchical regression,penalized likelihood,sensitivity analysis,smoothing","RESIDENTIAL MAGNETIC-FIELDS,CHILDHOOD ACUTE-LEUKEMIA,VOLTAGE POWER-LINES,EPIDEMIOLOGIC ANALYSES,LOGISTIC-REGRESSION,HIERARCHICAL-MODELS,BAYESIAN-INFERENCE,SYSTEMATIC-ERRORS,WIRE CODES,RISK","Greenland, S@Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Epidemiol, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA@Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Stat, Los Angeles, CA USA","Greenland, S@University of California Los Angeles@University of California System@University of California Los Angeles@University of California System",not exist,"Bayesian binomial regression: Predicting survival at a trauma center+Bedrick, EJ; Christensen, R; Johnson, W+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 1997::A new perspective on priors for generalized linear models+Bedrick, EJ; Christensen, R; Johnson, W+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1996::no title+Berk, Richard A.+Regression Analysis: A Constructive Critique+2004::no title+Bishop, YM; Fienberg, SE; Holland, PW.+Discrete Multivariate Analysis - Theory and Practice+1975::APPROXIMATE INFERENCE IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS+BRESLOW, NE; CLAYTON, DG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::no title+Carlin, BP; Louis, TA.+Bayes and Empirical Bayes Methods for Data Analysis+2000::Exposure to power-frequency magnetic fields and the risk of childhood cancer+Cheng, KK; Day, N; Cartwright, R; et al.+LANCET+DEC 4 1999::MULTIPLE IMPUTATION OF INDUSTRY AND OCCUPATION CODES IN CENSUS PUBLIC-USE SAMPLES USING BAYESIAN LOGISTIC-REGRESSION+CLOGG, CC; RUBIN, DB; SCHENKER, N; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1991::Extra low frequency electric and magnetic fields in the bedplace of children diagnosed with leukaemia: A case-control study+Coghill, RW; Steward, J; Philips, A+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER PREVENTION+JUN 1996::no title+Cox, D.

Since then there has been a proliferation of approximations of an iterative nature, or otherwise cumbersome, tendered for this problem; many of these approximations assume a uniform distribution within strata, and, in the case of skewed populations, that all strata have the same relative variation. What seems to have been missed is that the combination of these two assumptions offers a much simpler and equally effective method of subdivision for skewed populations; take the stratum boundaries in geometric progression.","coefficient of variation,efficiency,geometric progression,stratification methods,uniform distribution","MINIMUM-VARIANCE STRATIFICATION,OPTIMUM STRATIFICATION","Horgan, JM@Dublin City Univ, Sch Comp, Dublin 9, Ireland","Horgan, JM@Dublin City University",not exist,"COMPARISON OF METHODS FOR DETERMINING STRATUM BOUNDARIES+COCHRAN, WG+BULLETIN OF THE INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL INSTITUTE+1961::no title+Cochran, WG.+Sampling techniques+1977::MINIMUM VARIANCE STRATIFICATION+DALENIUS, T; HODGES, JL+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1959::The choice of stratification points+Dalenius, T.; Hodges, J.

Skewed normal variance-mean models for asset pricing and the method of moments,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2006.tb00164.x,APR 2006,15,14,"Financial returns (log-increments) data, Y-t, t = 1, 2,..., are treated as a stationary process, with the common distribution at each time point being not necessarily symmetric.

We consider as possible models for the common distribution four instances of the General Normal Variance-Mean Model (GNVM), which is described by Y/V similar to N (a (b + V), c(2) V + d(2)) where V is a nonnegative random variable and a, b, c and d are constants. When V is Gamma distributed and d = 0, Y has the skewed Variance-Gamma distribution (VG). When V follows a Half Normal distribution and c = 0, Y has the well-known Skew Normal (SN) distribution. We also consider two cases where V is Exponentially distributed. Bounds for skewness and kurtosis in each case are found in terms of the moments of the V. These are useful in determining whether the Method of Moments for a given model is feasible. The problem of overdetermination of parameters via estimating equations is examined. 5 data sets of actual returns data, chosen because of their earlier occurrence in the literature, are analysed using each of the 4 models.","normal variance-mean distribution,variance-gamma distribution,skewed normal,Laplace distribution,exponential distribution,method of moments,skewness,kurtosis","DISTRIBUTIONS,RETURNS,MARKET","Tjetjep, A@Univ Sydney, Sch Math & Stat F07, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia::Seneta, E@Univ Sydney, Sch Math & Stat F07, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Tjetjep, A@University of Sydney::Seneta, E@University of Sydney",not exist,"A CLASS OF DISTRIBUTIONS WHICH INCLUDES THE NORMAL ONES+AZZALINI, A+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+1985::Further results on a class of distributions which includes the normal ones+Azzalini, A.+Statistica+1986::NORMAL VARIANCE MEAN MIXTURES AND Z-DISTRIBUTIONS+BARNDORFFNIELSEN, O; KENT, J; SORENSEN, M+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+1982::HYPERBOLIC DISTRIBUTIONS AND DISTRIBUTIONS ON HYPERBOLAE+BARNDORFFNIELSEN, O+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+1978::The distribution of stock returns when the market is up+Chen, JT; Gupta, AK; Troskie, CG+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2003::no title+FINLAY R+SUBORDINATOR MODELS+2004::Some skew-symmetric models+Gupta, A.K.; Chang, F.C.; Huang, W.J.+Random Operators and Stochastic Equations+2002::A PROBABILISTIC REPRESENTATION OF THE SKEW-NORMAL DISTRIBUTION+HENZE, N+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+1986::Empirical realities for a minimal description risky asset model. the need for fractal features+Heyde, C.

Sample size considerations for multilevel surveys,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,DEC 2005,16,8,"Social and economic data commonly have a nested structure (for example, households nested within neighborhoods). Recently techniques and computer programs have become available for dealing with such data, permitting the formulation of explicit multilevel models with hypotheses about effects occurring at each level and across levels. If data users are planning to analyze survey data using multilevel models rather than concentrating on means, totals, and proportions, this needs to be accounted for in the survey design. The implications for determining sample sizes (for example, the number of neighborhoods in the sample and the number of households sampled within each neighborhood) are explored.","cost function,intraclass correlation,hierarchical model,regression coefficients",,"Cohen, MP@US Dept Transportat, Bur Transportat Stat, Washington, DC 20590 USA","Cohen, MP@Unknow","Cohen, Michael@L-3214-2018@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7734-7059","Determination of Sample Size for Multilevel Model Design+Afshartous, D.+ANN M AM ED RES ASS+1995::no title+Bryk, A.S; Raudenbush, S.W.+Hierarchical linear models+1992::Determining sample sizes for surveys with data analyzed by hierarchical linear models+Cohen, M.

The statistical education of Harold Jeffreys,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,DEC 2005,78,7,"The paper considers the statistical work of the physicist Harold Jeffreys. In 1933-4 Jeffreys had a controversy with R.A. Fisher, the leading statistician of the time. Prior to the encounter, Jeffreys had worked on probability as the basis for scientific inference and had used methods from the theory of errors in astronomy and seismology. He had also started to rework the theory of errors on the basis of his theory of probability. After the encounter Jeffreys produced a full-scale Bayesian treatment of statistics in the form of his Theory of Probability.","Harold Jeffreys,RA Fisher,Bayesian inference,fiducial argument","INVERSE PROBABILITY,FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES,UNKNOWN-PARAMETERS,SIGNIFICANCE TESTS,LIKELIHOOD,INFERENCE,FISHER,ERRORS,LOGIC","Aldrich, J@Univ Southampton, Sch Social Sci, Econ Div, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England","Aldrich, J@University of Southampton",not exist,"no title+ALDRICH J+GUIDE R A FISHER+2003::no title+ALDRICH J+H JEFFREYS STAT+2003::How likelihood and identification went Bayesian+Aldrich, J+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+APR 2002::Fisher's ""Inverse Probability"" of 1930+Aldrich, J+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+AUG 2000::R.

Statistical decision problems and Bayesian nonparametric methods,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,DEC 2005,40,6,"This paper considers parametric statistical decision problems conducted within a Bayesian nonparametric context. Our work was motivated by the realisation that typical parametric model selection procedures are essentially incoherent. We argue that one solution to this problem is to use a flexible enough model in the first place, a model that will not be checked no matter what data arrive. Ideally, one would use a nonparametric model to describe all the uncertainty about the density function generating the data. However, parametric models are the preferred choice for many statisticians, despite the incoherence involved in model checking, incoherence that is quite often ignored for pragmatic reasons. In this paper we show how coherent parametric inference can be carried out via decision theory and Bayesian nonparametrics. None of the ingredients discussed here are new, but our main point only becomes evident when one sees all priors-even parametric ones-as measures on sets of densities as opposed to measures on finite-dimensional parameter spaces.","coherence,consistency,decision theory,divergence,expected utility,nonparametric prior,parametric predictive density","DISTRIBUTIONS,INFERENCE,MODELS,CONSISTENCY,MIXTURE","Gutierrez-Pena, E@Natl Autonomous Univ Mexico, Dept Probabil & Stat, Mexico City, DF, Mexico@Univ Kent, Inst Math Stat & Actuarial Sci, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England::Walker, SG@Natl Autonomous Univ Mexico, Dept Probabil & Stat, Mexico City, DF, Mexico@Univ Kent, Inst Math Stat & Actuarial Sci, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England","Gutierrez-Pena, E@Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico@University of Kent::Walker, SG@Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico@University of Kent","Gutierrez Pena, Eduardo Arturo@N-9367-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4706-5226","The consistency of posterior distributions in nonparametric problems+Barron, A; Schervish, MJ; Wasserman, L+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 1999::no title+BASSETTI F+OUTLINE NEW PREDICTI+2001::MINIMUM HELLINGER DISTANCE ESTIMATES FOR PARAMETRIC MODELS+BERAN, R+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1977::Bayesian hypothesis testing: a reference approach+Bernardo, JM; Rueda, R+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+DEC 2002::A REVIEW OF RELIABLE MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ALGORITHMS FOR SEMIPARAMETRIC MIXTURE-MODELS+BOHNING, D+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+OCT 1 1995::SAMPLING AND BAYES INFERENCE IN SCIENTIFIC MODELING AND ROBUSTNESS+BOX, GEP+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1980::Eine informationstheoretische Ungleichung und ihre An wendung auf den Beweis der Ergodizitat von Markoffschen Ketten+Csiszar, I.+Publ.

A paradigm for masking (camouflaging) information,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,DEC 2005,25,4,"This is an expository paper. Here we propose a decision-theoretic framework for addressing aspects of the confidentiality of information problems in publicly released data. Our basic premise is that the problem needs to be conceptualized by looking at the actions of three agents: a data collector, a legitimate data user, and an intruder. Here we aim to prescribe the actions of the first agent who desires to provide useful information to the second agent, but must protect against possible misuse by the third. The first agent is under the constraint that the released data has to be public to all; this in some societies may not be the case.

A novel aspect of our paper is that all utilities-fundamental to decision making-are in terms of Shannon's information entropy. Thus what gets released is a distribution whose entropy maximizes the expected utility of the first agent. This means that the distribution that gets released will be different from that which generates the collected data. The discrepancy between the two distributions can be assessed via the Kullback-Leibler cross-entropy function. Our proposed strategy therefore boils down to the notion that it is the information content of the data, not the actual data, that gets masked. Current practice of ""statistical disclosure limitation"" masks the observed data via transformations or cell suppression. These transformations are guided by balancing what are known as ""disclosure risks"" and ""data utility"". The entropy indexed utility functions we propose are isomorphic to the above two entities. Thus our approach provides a formal link to that which is currently practiced in statistical disclosure limitation.","decision-theory,entropy,intrusion,Shannon information,statistical disclosure limitation,utility",DISCLOSURE,"Keller-McNulty, S@Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM 87544 USA@George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA::Nakhleh, CW@Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM 87544 USA@George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA::Singpurwalla, ND@Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM 87544 USA@George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA","Keller-McNulty, S@Los Alamos National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)@George Washington University::Nakhleh, CW@Los Alamos National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)@George Washington University::Singpurwalla, ND@Los Alamos National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)@George Washington University","SINGPURWALLA, Nozer Darabsha@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3578-2308","STATISTICAL INFORMATION AND LIKELIHOOD+BASU, D+SANKHYA-THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS SERIES A+1975::UNCERTAINTY, INFORMATION, AND SEQUENTIAL EXPERIMENTS+DEGROOT, MH+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1962::no title+DEWOLF PP+STAT NETHERLANDS+2004::THE RISK OF DISCLOSURE FOR MICRODATA+DUNCAN, G; LAMBERT, D+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+APR 1989::Enhancing access to microdata while protecting confidentiality: Prospects for the future+Duncan, G.; Pearson, R.+Statist.

How to choose a working model for measuring the statistical evidence about a regression parameter,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,DEC 2005,20,10,"Consider using a likelihood ratio to measure the strength of statistical evidence for one hypothesis over another. Recent work has shown that when the model is correctly specified, the likelihood ratio is seldom misleading. But when the model is not, misleading evidence may be observed quite frequently. Here we consider how to choose a working regression model so that the statistical evidence is correctly represented as often as it would be under the true model. We argue that the criteria for choosing a working model should be how often it correctly represents the statistical evidence about the object of interest (regression coefficient in the true model). We see that misleading evidence about the object of interest is more likely to be observed when the working model is chosen according to other criteria (e.g., parsimony or predictive accuracy).","The law of likelihood,statistical evidence,misleading evidence,model selection","CLUSTERED DATA,LIKELIHOOD,SELECTION","Blume, JA@Brown Univ, Ctr Stat Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Blume, JA@Brown University",not exist,"Information Theory and an Extension of the Maximum Likelihood Principle+Akaike, H.+2 INT S INF THEOR+1973::no title+BARNARD GA+J AM STAT ASSOC+1947::no title+Berger, J.

Analysing your Multivariate data as a pictorial: A case for applying biplot methodology?,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,DEC 2005,23,6,"This paper illustrates the versatility of biplot methodology when analysing multivariate data from diverse disciplines. The modern approach of Gower & Hand (1996) whereby biplots are regarded as multivariate analogues of ordinary scatter plots is utilised for extending biplot methodology introducing several novel applications. Focus is on biplot applications where the merits of principal component biplots and canonical variate analysis biplots are illustrated with data sets from higher education, the manufacturing industry, the mining industry, agriculture, finance and archaeology. It is shown how to equip biplots with quality regions, classification regions and acceptance regions; how a-bags superimposed on biplots provide a quantification of the multidimensional overlap of classes as well as enable biplots to be used with large data sets; how to use biplots for exploring multi-dimensional reality and in sophisticated classification procedures.","alpha-bag,biplot,canonical variate analysis,classification,data visualisation,principal components,quality control",DEPTH,"le Roux, NJ@Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, ZA-7602 Stellenbosch, South Africa::Gardner, S@Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, ZA-7602 Stellenbosch, South Africa","le Roux, NJ@Stellenbosch University::Gardner, S@Stellenbosch University",not exist,"Monitoring of metallurgical process plants by using biplots+Aldrich, C; Gardner, S; Le Roux, NJ+AICHE JOURNAL+SEP 2004::School results and access test results as indicators of first-year performance at university+Bothma, A.; Botha, H.L.; Le Roux, N.J.+ORiON+2004::no title+BURDEN M+SA J CULTURAL HIST+2001::no title+Chambers, J.

At the design level, remote sensing typically helps in the definition of sampling units and the stratification, but can also be exploited to optimise the sample allocation and size of sampling units. At the estimator level, classified satellite images are generally used as auxiliary variables in a regression estimator or for estimators based on confusion matrixes. The most often used satellite images are LANDSAT-TM and SPOT-XS. In general, classified or photo-interpreted images should not be directly used to estimate crop areas because the proportion of pixels classified into the specific crop is often strongly biased. Vegetation indexes computed from satellite images can give in some cases a good indication of the potential crop yield.",,"SMALL-AREA ESTIMATION,FOREST AREA,ESTIMATORS,CALIBRATION,INFORMATION,PROPORTION,ERROR,AVHRR","Carfagna, E@Univ Bologna, Dept Stat, I-40126 Bologna, Italy@Joint Res Ctr, Ispra, Va, Italy::Gallego, FJ@Univ Bologna, Dept Stat, I-40126 Bologna, Italy@Joint Res Ctr, Ispra, Va, Italy","Carfagna, E@University of Bologna@EC JRC ISPRA Site@European Commission Joint Research Centre::Gallego, FJ@University of Bologna@EC JRC ISPRA Site@European Commission Joint Research Centre",not exist,"A Look at the Remote Sensing Applications Program of the National Agricultural Statistics Service+Allen, J.

The industrial statistics divide: Are statisticians really relevant to business and industry?,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,AUG 2005,1,1,"O wad some Power the giftie gie us

To see oursels as ithers see us!

An' foolish notion:...

- Robert Burns, ""To a Louse"".

The stated purpose of this conference contains the provocative assertion that

""[Statistics] does not receive the recognition it needs... as a vital part of making progress

in... business and industry... ""

I agree. I believe that there is a significant divide between senior management in business and industry (Them), and the statisticians (Us) who work on business and industrial problems: in a sense to borrow from George Bernard Shaw-two groups divided by lack of a common language. A lot of their words aren't in our vocabulary, and a lot of our words aren't in theirs.

Such is not the case in many other major domains of statistical practice-Government, Insurance, Medicine to name but three. Why is this so and what can we do about it in Business and Industry? This paper seeks to explore these questions, and to argue that their resolution will involve a sustained commitment by the Statistics profession to areas such as statistical education, public awareness, and promoting professionalism in the practice of Statistics. However, the most important commitment might need to be that the Statistics profession take Robert Burns to heart.","performance measurement,statistical education,public awareness,professional accreditation",,"Fisher, NI@Univ Sydney, Sch Math, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Fisher, NI@University of Sydney",not exist,"Using statistics and statistical thinking to improve organisational performance+Dransfield, SB; Fisher, NI; Vogel, NJ+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+AUG 1999"

The role of NSOs in assuring national prosperity: A case study of Korea,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,AUG 2005,6,0,"As changes in the socio-economic environment become more rapid, so the role of statistics in society becomes more important. At the same time, the role of a national statistical office (hereafter NSO) as a provider of official statistics attracts increasing interest because the function of an NSO in a country assuredly depends on changes in the economic and social surroundings in pursuit of national prosperity.

In this paper, the strong relationship between the social and economic development of a country and the development of a national statistical office will be explicated using the example of Korea, which has experienced dynamic take-off in both economic and social sectors during the last 40 years. The progress of the Korean NSO will be studied in three time periods by looking at the socio-economic changes in each period, and how the NSO responded. In addition, as the Global Age emerged in the late 1990s, the Korean NSO started to encounter new demands at a time of limited resources and a worsening statistical environment. In light of this, several current issues and corresponding strategies for NSOs will be suggested.","official statistics,e-NSO,open NSO,the global age",,"Oh, JN@NSO Korea, Taejon, South Korea","Oh, JN@Unknow",not exist,"no title+ATKINSON A+CELEBRATION STAT ISI+1985::no title+FRANKFORTNACHMI.C+SOCIAL STAT DIVERSE+2002::no title+KIM S+E GOVT THEORY STRA 1+2003::no title+KIM S+STUDY NEW GOVERNANCE+2001::The citizens' right to information and the duties of a democratic state in modern IT environment - in the light of the UN fundamental principles of official statistics and the ISI Declaration on Statistical Ethics+Olenski, J+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+APR 2003::no title+SONG M+STAT KOREA HIST ROLE+2001"

The primary concern of statistics is to develop a logical and efficient system for information acquisition and analysis that is geared towards broad applications. Such a system has its roots and extensions in case studies from many scientific disciplines and in the collaboration between statisticians and other scientists. During the past three decades statisticians have become actively involved in the development and use of quantitative methods to understand and solve environmental problems. These activities are commonly called Environmetrics. In this paper we review the main features of current Environmetrics research and outreach activities. The paper is structured around typical examples drawn mainly from water quality and climate change to illustrate the type of problems involved, the statistical approaches used to address them, and the new statistical methods required for their solution. In addition we shall also briefly describe efforts made at the international level to link the statisticians working in the field together and with environmental scientists.","pollution,exposure,climate change,regulations,environmental indices,extreme events,models",,"El-Shaarawi, AH@Environm Canada, Canada Ctr Inland Waters, Natl Water Res Inst, Burlington, ON L7R 4A6, Canada@Katholieke Univ Leuven, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium::Teugels, J@Environm Canada, Canada Ctr Inland Waters, Natl Water Res Inst, Burlington, ON L7R 4A6, Canada@Katholieke Univ Leuven, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium","El-Shaarawi, AH@Environment & Climate Change Canada@Canada Centre for Inland Waters (CCIW)@National Water Research Institute@KU Leuven::Teugels, J@Environment & Climate Change Canada@Canada Centre for Inland Waters (CCIW)@National Water Research Institute@KU Leuven",not exist,"no title+Barnett, V.+Environmental Statistics: Methods and Applications+2004::no title+BRILLINGER DR+STAT SCI+2003::no title+El-Shaarawi, A.

Roles of statistics in the life sciences,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,AUG 2005,1,0,"Quantitative methodologies have always been central in the life sciences, and some of these belong to the general area of statistics. Other methods of data analysis have their part to play, and it is of ongoing importance for the field of statistics to adapt to these developments.

Besides the role of statistical methods in generating new knowledge, there are also regulatory uses of statistics, particularly in drug registration and in environmental standard setting. These dual roles of statistical methods should not be confused.

Statistical data from official sources and elsewhere play important roles in the life sciences, and often necessitate very careful adherence to confidentiality.

Much ado about nothing: the mixed models controversy revisited,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,APR 2005,24,8,"We consider a well-known controversy that stems from the use of two mixed models for the analysis of balanced experimental data with a fixed and a random factor. It essentially originates in the different statistics developed from such models for testing that the variance parameter associated to the random factor is null. The corresponding hypotheses are interpreted as that of null random factor main effects in the presence of interaction. The controversy is further complicated by different opinions regarding the appropriateness of such hypothesis. Assuming that this is a sensible option, we show that the standard test statistics obtained under both models are really directed at different hypotheses and conclude that the problem lies in the definition of the main effects and interactions. We use expected values as in the fixed effects case to resolve the controversy showing that under the most commonly used model, the test usually associated to the inexistence of the random factor main effects addresses a different hypothesis. We discuss the choice of models, and some further problems that occur in the presence of unbalanced data.","mixed model,random effect,variance components","VARIANCE-COMPONENTS,LINEAR-MODELS,TESTS","Lencina, VB@Univ Nacl Tucuman, Dept Invest, FM, RA-4000 San Miguel De Tucuman, Tucuman, Argentina@Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Estatist, IME, BR-05508 Sao Paulo, Brazil@Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biostat & Epidemiol, SPH, Amherst, MA 01003 USA::Singer, JM@Univ Nacl Tucuman, Dept Invest, FM, RA-4000 San Miguel De Tucuman, Tucuman, Argentina@Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Estatist, IME, BR-05508 Sao Paulo, Brazil@Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biostat & Epidemiol, SPH, Amherst, MA 01003 USA::Stanek, EJ@Univ Nacl Tucuman, Dept Invest, FM, RA-4000 San Miguel De Tucuman, Tucuman, Argentina@Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Estatist, IME, BR-05508 Sao Paulo, Brazil@Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biostat & Epidemiol, SPH, Amherst, MA 01003 USA","Lencina, VB@Universidad Nacional de Tucuman@Universidade de Sao Paulo@University of Massachusetts Amherst@University of Massachusetts System::Singer, JM@Universidad Nacional de Tucuman@Universidade de Sao Paulo@University of Massachusetts Amherst@University of Massachusetts System::Stanek, EJ@Universidad Nacional de Tucuman@Universidade de Sao Paulo@University of Massachusetts Amherst@University of Massachusetts System","Singer, Julio@C-1232-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6515-9643","INTERACTION+COX, DR; ATKINSON, AC; BOX, GEP; et al.+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+1984::Voss, D.

Simple stepwise tests of hypotheses and multiple comparisons,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,APR 2005,26,5,"Holm's (1979) step-down and Hochberg's (1988) step-up procedures for tests of multiple hypotheses are simple to apply and are widely used. Holm's procedure controls the familywise error rate (FWE), while Hochberg's is more powerful. This paper investigates a step-down procedure (labelled CS) of Seneta & Chen (1997) which is a sharpening of Holm's, takes into account the degree of association between test statistics, and also controls the FWE. Computation for the CS procedure may be minimized by using the procedure as an adjustment to Holm's. The computational steps are detailed, and the adjustment is then illustrated by an application to a text-book example of multiple comparisons, in which step-wise procedures are shown to perform better than the usual Tukey T-comparison. Simulation investigations in a standard comparison with a control setting show that the CS step-down procedure is more powerful than Hochberg's step-up procedure and the procedure of Simes (1986), especially in regard to error rate, and not much less powerful than an optimal, but very specific, step-up procedure of Dunnett & Tamhane (1992).","multiple hypotheses,step-down tests,familywise error rate,Holm's procedure,Hochberg's procedure,multiple comparisons,P-value,correlation,Simes' test,Dunnett's test,multivariate t-distribution","SIMULTANEOUS INFERENCE,BONFERRONI PROCEDURE,PROBABILITY,CONJECTURE,UNION,PROOF","Seneta, E@Univ Sydney, Sch Math & Stat, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia@Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Bowling Green, OH 43402 USA::Chen, JT@Univ Sydney, Sch Math & Stat, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia@Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Bowling Green, OH 43402 USA","Seneta, E@University of Sydney@Bowling Green State University::Chen, JT@University of Sydney@Bowling Green State University",not exist,"no title+CHEN JT+B INT STAT I+1999::no title+Devore, J.

"Use of statistics in the monetary, policy of the Czech National Bank: The case of a country in transition",INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,APR 2005,10,0,"In the presented text the authors judge the importance of statistics in the monetary policy of the Czech National Bank (CNB) over the course of the economic transformation process, with particular consideration of changing statistical needs and the possibilities and limits of statistical data exploitation in the monetary analyses. The importance of statistics lies on the level of collection and processing of statistical information and on the level of use of statistical methods to analyse data. Since the start of the 1990s the requirements for statistics were significantly influenced by monetary policy. In the period 1990-1997, monetary targeting was the primary influential factor. Since 1998, the monetary policy is influenced by inflation targeting. Statistical priorities switched from monetary data to economy and financial market data. Much progress has been made in the use of statistical methods for analysing data. Statistics available at present cover the CNB's standard monetary-policy requirements and are on par with those in developed countries. Its further development will reflect the standard changes taking place in the more advanced countries.","economic transformation,monetary policy,collection of statistical. information,statistical and econometric methods and models,macroeconomic models",CONSUMPTION,"Matalik, I@Czech Natl Bank, Prague, Czech Republic@Univ Econ Prague, Prague, Czech Republic::Arlt, J@Czech Natl Bank, Prague, Czech Republic@Univ Econ Prague, Prague, Czech Republic","Matalik, I@Unknow@University of Economics - Prague::Arlt, J@Unknow@University of Economics - Prague","Arlt, Josef@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8349-7419","no title+ARLT J+797 CZECH NAT BANK+1997::no title+ARLT J+MODERNI METODY MODEL+2003::Selected aspects of consumption function in the Czech Republic in the nineties+Arlt, J; Cutkova, J; Radkovsky, S+POLITICKA EKONOMIE+2002::Selected factors influencing the money demand development in 1994-2000+Arlt, J; Guba, M; Radkovsky, S; et al.+POLITICKA EKONOMIE+2001::no title+*EUROSTAT+EUR SYST ACC 1995+1995::no title+*EUROSTAT+HDB Q NAT ACC+1999::THE ADJUSTMENT OF CONSUMPTION TO CHANGING EXPECTATIONS ABOUT FUTURE INCOME+FLAVIN, MA+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+1981::no title+Hendry,, D.

Automatic editing for business surveys: An assessment of selected algorithms,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,APR 2005,82,8,"Statistical offices are responsible for publishing accurate statistical information about many different aspects of society. This task is complicated considerably by the fact that data collected by statistical offices generally contain errors. These errors have to be corrected before reliable statistical information can be published. This correction process is referred to as statistical data editing. Traditionally, data editing was mainly an interactive activity with the aim to correct all data in every detail. For that reason the data editing process was both expensive and time-consuming. To improve the efficiency of the editing process it can be partly automated. One often divides the statistical data editing process into the error localisation step and the imputation step. In this article we restrict ourselves to discussing the former step, and provide an assessment, based on personal experience, of several selected algorithims for automatically solving the error localisation problem for numerical (continuous) data. Our article can be seen as an extension of the overview article by Liepins, Garfinkel & Kunnathur (1982). All algorithms we discuss are based on the (generalised) Fellegi-Holt paradigm that says that the data of a record should be made to satisfy all edits by changing the fewest possible (weighted) number of fields. The error localisation problem may have several optimal solutions for a record. In contrast to what is common in the literature, most of the algorithms we describe aim to find all optimal solutions rather than just one. As numerical data mostly occur in business surveys, the described algorithms are mainly suitable for business surveys and less so for social surveys. For four algorithms we compare the computing times on six realistic data sets as well as their complexity.","branch-and-bound,cutting planes,error localisation,Fellegi-Holt method,Fellegi-Holt paradigm,Fourier-Motzkin elimination,integer programming,statistical data editing,vertex generation","ERRONEOUS DATA,IMPUTATION,OUTLIERS","de Waal, T@Stat Netherlands, Voorburg, Netherlands::Coutinho, W@Stat Netherlands, Voorburg, Netherlands","de Waal, T@Unknow::Coutinho, W@Unknow","de Waal, Ton@H-8669-2016@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1515-3790","FAST VERY ROBUST METHODS FOR THE DETECTION OF MULTIPLE OUTLIERS+ATKINSON, AC+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1994::A search engine based on neural correlation matrix memories+Austin, J; Lees, K+NEUROCOMPUTING+NOV 2000::A generic implementation of the nearest-neighbour imputation methodology (NIM)+Bankier, M.; Poirier, P.; Lachance, M.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Mason, P</span>.+P 2 INT C EST SURV B+2000::no title+BARCAROLI G+METHODOLOGY EDITING+1995::no title+Barnett, V.; Lewis, T.; Abeles, Francine.+Outliers in statistical data+1994::Multivariate outlier detection in incomplete survey data: the epidemic algorithm and transformed rank correlations+Beguin, C; Hulliger, B+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+2004::BACON: blocked adaptive computationally efficient outlier nominators+Billor, N; Hadi, AS; Velleman, PF+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+SEP 28 2000::no title+Bishop, MC.+Neural networks for pattern recognition+1995::no title+BOSKOVITZ A+LOGICAL FORMALISATIO+2003::no title+Breiman, L.+Classification and regression trees+1984::no title+Bruni, R.; Sassano, A.+Logic and Optimization Techniques for an Error Free Data Collecting.

Extending power and sample size approaches developed for McNemar's procedure to general sign tests,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,APR 2005,18,2,"Current software and textbooks present procedures to estimate power and sample size for sign tests that only apply to settings where positive (i.e., X = 1) or negative (i.e., X = - 1), but not neutral (i.e., X = 0) outcomes occur. However, many studies analyzed by sign tests involve the more general setting where significant amounts of neutral outcomes can occur. This paper illustrates extension of existing power/sample size approaches and software that have been developed for matched binary responses (McNemar's discordant pairs) to general sign tests with neutral outcomes occurring. An application is made to a recent study that the author collaborated on.","McNemar's procedure,power,sample size,sign test","MATCHED CASE-CONTROL,DESIGN,TIES","Hoover, DR@Rutgers State Univ, Dept Stat, Hill Ctr 473, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA","Hoover, DR@Rutgers State University New Brunswick",not exist,"no title+BORENSTEIN M+SAMPLEPOWER VERSION+2003::Versions of the sign test in the presence of ties+Coakley, CW; Heise, MA+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1996::THE COMPARISON OF PERCENTAGES IN MATCHED SAMPLES+COCHRAN, WG+BIOMETRIKA+1950::THE STATISTICAL SIGN TEST+DIXON, WJ; MOOD, AM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1946::POWER CALCULATIONS FOR MATCHED CASE CONTROL STUDIES+DUPONT, WD+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1988::no title+DUPONT WD+PS POWER SAMPLE SIZE+2001::no title+ELASHOFF JD+NQUERY ADVISOR RELEA+2000::no title+Hintze, J.+PASS 2000+2000::no title+Hollander,, M.; Wolfe,, D.

The t copula and related copulas,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,APR 2005,31,291,"The t copula and its properties are described with a focus on issues related to the dependence of extreme values. The Gaussian mixture representation of a multivariate t distribution is used as a starting point to construct two new copulas, the skewed t copula and the grouped t copula, which allow more heterogeneity in the modelling of dependent observations. Extreme value considerations are used to derive two further new copulas: the t extreme value copula is the limiting copula of componentwise maxima of t distributed random vectors; the t lower tail copula is the limiting copula of bivariate observations from a t distribution that are conditioned to lie below some joint threshold that is progressively lowered. Both these copulas may be approximated for practical purposes by simpler, better-known copulas, these being the Gumbel and Clayton copulas respectively.","copula,multivariate t distribution,Kendall's rank correlation,tail dependence,multivariate extreme value theory,Gumbel copula,Clayton copula","ELLIPTIC DISTRIBUTIONS,DEPENDENCE,EXTREMES","Demarta, S@ETH Zentrum, Fed Inst Technol, Dept Math, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland::McNeil, AJ@ETH Zentrum, Fed Inst Technol, Dept Math, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Demarta, S@ETH Zurich::McNeil, AJ@ETH Zurich","McNeil, Alexander@O-9152-2016@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6137-2890","no title+Abramowitz, M; Stegun, I.A.+HDB MATH FUNCTIONS+1965::no title+BARNDORFFNIELSE.O+STAT DISTRIBUTIONS S+1981::no title+BLAESILD P+STAT DISTRIBUTIONS S+1981::Dependence structures for multivariate high-frequency data in finance+Breymann, W; Dias, A; Embrechts, P+QUANTITATIVE FINANCE+FEB 2003::Statistical methods for multivariate extremes: an application to structural design (with discussion)+Coles, S.; Tziwn, T.+Appl.

Fisher and inference for scores,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,APR 2005,48,1,"This paper examines the work of Fisher and Bartlett on discriminant analysis, ordinal response regression and correspondence analysis. Placing these methods with canonical correlation analysis in the context of the singular value decomposition of particular matrices, we use explicit models and vector space notation to unify these methods, understand Fisher's approach, understand Bartlett's criticisms of Fisher and relate both to modern thinking. We consider in particular the formulation of certain hypotheses and Fisher's arguments to obtain approximate distributions for tests of these hypotheses (without assuming multivariate normality) and put these in modern notation. Using perturbation techniques pioneered by G.S. Watson, we give an asymptotic justification for Fisher's test for assigned scores and thereby resolve a long standing conflict between Fisher and Bartlett.","discriminant analysis,ordinal response regression,correspondence analysis,asymptotic approximations","MULTIPLE MEASUREMENTS,MULTIVARIATE-ANALYSIS,CONTINGENCY,STATISTICS,EQUATIONS,MODELS","Welsh, AH@Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia@Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia::Robinson, J@Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia@Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Welsh, AH@Australian National University@University of Sydney::Robinson, J@Australian National University@University of Sydney",not exist,"no title+Agresti, A.+Analysis of Ordinal Categorical Data+1984::no title+AGRESTI, Alan.+Categorical data analysis+1990::The irises of the Gaspe Peninsula+Anderson, E.+Bull.

Three distinct notions of causality are set out and implications for densities and for linear dependencies explained. The importance of appreciating the possibility of effect modifiers is stressed, be they intermediate variables, background variables or unobserved confounders. In many contexts the issue of unobserved confounders is salient. The difficulties of interpretation when there are joint effects are discussed and possible modifications of analysis explained. The dangers of uncritical conditioning and marginalization over intermediate response variables are set out and some of the problems of generalizing conclusions to populations and individuals explained. In general terms the importance of search for possibly causal variables is stressed but the need for caution is emphasized.","chain block graph,counterfactual,explanation,instrumental variable,interaction,Markov graph,observational study,overview,regression analysis,surrogate variable,unit-treatment additivity,unobserved confounder","GRAPHS,ASSOCIATION,CAUSATION,INFERENCE,MODELS","Cox, DR@Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford OX1 1NF, England@Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden::Wermuth, N@Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford OX1 1NF, England@Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden","Cox, DR@University of Oxford@University of Gothenburg::Wermuth, N@University of Oxford@University of Gothenburg",not exist,"no title+AALEN O+SCAND ACTUAR J+1987::NEPHROGENIC RESTS NEPHROBLASTOMATOSIS AND THE PATHOGENESIS OF WILMS' TUMOR+BECKWITH J B; KIVIAT N B; BONADIO J F+Pediatric Pathology+1990::USE AND ABUSE OF REGRESSION+BOX, GEP+TECHNOMETRICS+1966::THE PLANNING OF OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES OF HUMAN-POPULATIONS+COCHRAN, WG+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-GENERAL+1965::RANDOMIZATION MODELS FOR MATCHED AND UNMATCHED 2 BY 2 TABLES+COPAS, JB+BIOMETRIKA+1973::no title+Cox, D.+Planning of Experiments+1958::no title+COX DR+APPL SATA+1981::CAUSALITY - SOME STATISTICAL ASPECTS+COX, DR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1992::A general condition for avoiding effect reversal after marginalization+Cox, DR; Wermuth, N+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2003::Some remarks on failure-times, surrogate markers, degradation, wear, and the quality of life+Cox, DR+LIFETIME DATA ANALYSIS+DEC 1999::no title+Cox, DR; Wermuth, N.+Multivariate dependencies+1996::LINEAR DEPENDENCIES REPRESENTED BY CHAIN GRAPHS+COX, DR; WERMUTH, N+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+AUG 1993::Causal inference without counterfactuals+Dawid, AP+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2000::Proof of causality - deduction from epidemiological observation+Doll, R+PERSPECTIVES IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE+FAL 2002::Arrangement of Field Experiments+Fisher, R.

A foundational justification for a weighted likelihood approach to inference,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,DEC 2004,26,1,"Two types of probability are discussed, one of which is additive whilst the other is non-additive. Popular theories that attempt to justify the importance of the additivity of probability are then critically reviewed. By making assumptions the two types of probability put forward are utilised to justify a method of inference which involves betting preferences being revised in light of the data. This method of inference can be viewed as a justification for a weighted likelihood approach to inference where the plausibility of different values of a parameter theta based on the data (x) over tilde is measured by the quantity q (theta) = l((x) over tilde, theta)omega(theta), where l((x) over tilde, theta) is the likelihood function and omega(theta) is a weight function. Even though, unlike Bayesian inference, the method has the disadvantageous property that the measure q (theta) is generally non-additive, it is argued that the method has other properties which may be considered very desirable and which have the potential to imply that when everything is taken into account, the method is a serious alternative to the Bayesian approach in many situations. The methodology that is developed is applied to both a toy example and a real example.","non-additive probability,weighted likelihood,dutch-book argument,Ellsberg paradox","SUBJECTIVE-PROBABILITY,EXPECTED UTILITY,DEFINITION,AMBIGUITY,PARADOX,AXIOM","Bowater, RJ@Univ Padua, Dipartimento Sci Stat, I-35121 Padua, Italy","Bowater, RJ@University of Padua",not exist,"BEHAVIOR OF THE RATIONAL MAN BEFORE RISK - CRITICISM OF AMERICAN SCHOOL POSTULATES AND AXIOMS+Allais, M.+ECONOMETRICA+OCT 1953::A DEFINITION OF SUBJECTIVE-PROBABILITY+ANSCOMBE, FJ; AUMANN, RJ+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1963::no title+Bernardo, JM; Smith, AFM.+Bayesian theory+1994::Experimental results on decision making under uncertainty+Cohen, M.; Jaffray, J.

Parametric inference for diffusion processes observed at discrete points in time: a survey,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,DEC 2004,56,76,This paper is a survey of estimation techniques for stationary and ergodic diffusion processes observed at discrete points in time. The reader is introduced to the following techniques: (i) estimating functions with special emphasis on martingale estimating functions and so-called simple estimating functions; (ii) analytical and numerical approximations of the likelihood function which can in principle be made arbitrarily accurate; (iii) Bayesian analysis and MCMC methods; and (iv) indirect inference and EMM which both introduce auxiliary (but wrong) models and correct for the implied bias by simulation.,"Bayesian analysis,diffusion processes,discrete-time observations,efficient method of moments (EMM),estimating functions,indirect inference,likelihood approximations","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,MARTINGALE ESTIMATING FUNCTIONS,STOCHASTIC VOLATILITY MODELS,SMALL DELTA-OPTIMALITY,NONLINEAR DIFFUSIONS,COEFFICIENT,APPROXIMATION,MOMENTS,RATES","Sorensen, H@Royal Vet & Agr Univ, Dept Nat Sci, DK-1871 Frederiksberg C, Denmark","Sorensen, H@University of Copenhagen","Sorensen, Helle@P-8978-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5273-6093","Maximum likelihood estimation of discretely sampled diffusions: A closed-form approximation approach+Ait-Sahalia, Y+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 2002::Nonparametric pricing of interest rate derivative securities+Ait-Sahalia, Y+ECONOMETRICA+MAY 1996::Transition densities for interest rate and other nonlinear diffusions+Ait-Sahalia, Y+JOURNAL OF FINANCE+AUG 1999::no title+AITSAHALIA Y+CLOSED FORM EXPANSIO+2002::Estimating continuous-time stochastic volatility models of the short-term interest rate+Andersen, TG; Lund, J+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+APR 1997::Martingale estimating functions for discretely observed diffusion processes+Bibby, B.M.; Sorensen, M.+Bernoulli+1995::A hyperbolic diffusion model for stock prices+Bibby, B.

Recent developments of statistical approaches in aspects of accounting: a review,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,DEC 2004,51,4,"We review and simultaneously introduce a convenient statistical concept for the mathematical representation of the Statistical Activity Cost Theory (SACT) introduced by Willett (1987, 1988). Further, we discuss, and present a critique of a variety of statistical models with respect to long debated accounting problems, such as the allocation of joint costs and depreciation. We finally propose that taking the effort to combine those models results in a novel statistical accounting system and this is discussed by means of the so-called virtual firm. Our approach is methodological rather than empirical. We endeavour to demonstrate that the statistical models presented herein have a more natural interpretation and applicability than their deterministic analogues: hence, this review presents promising outcomes and useful perspectives for the accounting profession.","accounting systems,conditioning,depreciation,Markov chains,statistical activity cost theory (SACT),virtual firm","TIME-SERIES PROPERTIES,PROBABILISTIC DEPRECIATION,MODELS","Falta, M@Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia::Wolff, R@Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia","Falta, M@Queensland University of Technology (QUT)::Wolff, R@Queensland University of Technology (QUT)",not exist,"no title+Ahsanullah, M; Rukhin, A.

A comparative analysis of different IV and GMM estimators of dynamic panel data models,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,DEC 2004,23,12,"It is well known that the usual procedures for estimating panel data models are inconsistent in the dynamic setting. A large number of consistent estimators however, have been proposed in the literature. This paper provides a survey of the majority of mainstream estimators, which tend to consist of IV and GMM ones. It also considers a newly proposed extension to the promising Wansbeek-Bekker estimator (Harris & Matyas, 2000). To provide guidance to the applied researcher working on micro-datasets, the small sample performance of these estimators is evaluated using a set of Monte Carlo experiments.","panel data,dynamic models,Monte Carlo,IV and GMM estimators","INSTRUMENTAL-VARIABLE ESTIMATION,ERROR-COMPONENTS MODELS,EFFICIENT ESTIMATION,MOMENTS,BIAS","Harris, MN@Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Clayton, Vic 3168, Australia@Cent European Univ, Budapest, Hungary@Univ Paris 12, Erudite, Creteil, France::Matyas, L@Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Clayton, Vic 3168, Australia@Cent European Univ, Budapest, Hungary@Univ Paris 12, Erudite, Creteil, France","Harris, MN@Monash University@Central European University@University of Paris-Est Creteil::Matyas, L@Monash University@Central European University@University of Paris-Est Creteil","Harris, Mark@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1804-4357","no title+AHN SC+GEN METHOD MOMENTS E+1999::Efficient estimation of dynamic panel data models: Alternative assumptions and simplified estimation+Ahn, SC; Schmidt, P+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JAN-FEB 1997::EFFICIENT ESTIMATION OF MODELS FOR DYNAMIC PANEL-DATA+AHN, SC; SCHMIDT, P+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUL 1995::Small-sample bias in GMM estimation of covariance structures+Altonji, JG; Segal, LM+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JUL 1996::INSTRUMENTAL-VARIABLE ESTIMATION OF AN ERROR-COMPONENTS MODEL+AMEMIYA, T; MACURDY, TE+ECONOMETRICA+JUL 1986::no title+ARELLANO M+HDB ECONOMETRIC+2001::ANOTHER LOOK AT THE INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE ESTIMATION OF ERROR-COMPONENTS MODELS+ARELLANO, M; BOVER, O+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUL 1995::no title+ARELLANO M+NOTE ANDERSON HSIAO+1988::POOLING CROSS SECTION AND TIME SERIES DATA IN ESTIMATION OF A DYNAMIC MODEL - DEMAND FOR NATURAL GAS+BALESTRA, P; NERLOVE, M+ECONOMETRICA+1966::Initial conditions and moment restrictions in dynamic panel data models+Blundell, R; Bond, S+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+NOV 1998::Some tests of specification for panel data: Monte-Carlo evidence and an application to employment equations+Bond, S.; Arellano, M.+&lt;IT&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/IT&gt;+1991::no title+BREITUNG J+GEN METHOD MOMENTS E+1999::EFFICIENT ESTIMATION USING PANEL DATA+BREUSCH, TS; MIZON, GE; SCHMIDT, P+ECONOMETRICA+MAY 1989::MULTIVARIATE REGRESSION-MODELS FOR PANEL DATA+CHAMBERLAIN, G+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+1982::Parameters of interest, nuisance parameters and orthogonality conditions - An application to autoregressive error component models+Crepon, B; Kramarz, F; Trognon, A+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JAN 1998::LARGE SAMPLE PROPERTIES OF GENERALIZED-METHOD OF MOMENTS ESTIMATORS+HANSEN, LP+ECONOMETRICA+1982::PANEL DATA AND UNOBSERVABLE INDIVIDUAL EFFECTS+HAUSMAN, JA; TAYLOR, WE+ECONOMETRICA+1981::EXISTENCE OF MOMENTS OF K-CLASS ESTIMATORS+KINAL, TW+ECONOMETRICA+1980::ON BIAS, INCONSISTENCY, AND EFFICIENCY OF VARIOUS ESTIMATORS IN DYNAMIC PANEL-DATA MODELS+KIVIET, JF+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUL 1995::BIASES IN DYNAMIC-MODELS WITH FIXED EFFECTS+NICKELL, S+ECONOMETRICA+1981::no title+SEVESTRE P+ECONOMETRICS PANEL D+1996::A NOTE ON AUTOREGRESSIVE ERROR-COMPONENTS MODELS+SEVESTRE, P; TROGNON, A+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+1985::On IV, GMM and ML in a dynamic panel data model+Wansbeek, T; Bekker, P+ECONOMICS LETTERS+MAY 1996"
Statistical inference under symmetry,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,DEC 2004,44,12,"We explore the consequences of adjoining a symmetry group to a statistical model. Group actions are first induced on the sample space, and then on the parameter space. It is argued that the right invariant measure induced by the group on the parameter space is a natural non-informative prior for the parameters of the model. The permissible sub-parameters are introduced, i.e., the subparameters upon which group actions can be defined. Equivariant estimators are similarly defined. Orbits of the group are defined on the sample space and on the parameter space; in particular the group action is called transitive when there is only one orbit. Credibility sets and confidence sets are shown (under right invariant prior and assuming transitivity on the parameter space) to be equal when defined by permissible sub-parameters and constructed from equivariant estimators. The effect of different choices of transformation group is illustrated by examples, and properties of the orbits on the sample space and on the parameter space are discussed. It is argued that model reduction should be constrained to one or several orbits of the group. Using this and other natural criteria and concepts, among them concepts related to design of experiments under symmetry, leads to links towards chemometrical prediction methods and towards the foundation of quantum theory.","confidence sets,credibility sets,group,invariance,invariant measure,loss,non-informative prior,optimal estimator,objective Bayes,orbit,partial least squares regression,permissible sub-parameter,Pitman estimator,quantum mechanics,right invariant prior,risk,symmetry,transitivity","RIGHT HAAR MEASURE,MODELS,DISTRIBUTIONS","Helland, IS@Univ Oslo, N-0316 Oslo, Norway","Helland, IS@University of Oslo",not exist,"no title+BAILEY RA+DESIGN COMP EXPT+2003::A UNIFIED APPROACH TO DESIGN OF EXPERIMENTS+BAILEY, RA+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1981::no title+Berger, J.+Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis+1985::no title+BONDAR JV+Z WAHRSCHEINLICHKEIT+1972::no title+BONDESSON L+ENCY STAT SCI+1982::Statistical modeling: The two cultures+Breiman, L+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+AUG 2001::no title+Burnham, KP; Anderson, DR.+Model selection and multimodel inference: a practical information-theoretic approach+2002::THE FUNCTIONAL-MODEL BASIS OF FIDUCIAL-INFERENCE+DAWID, AP; STONE, M+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1982::no title+DAWID AP+ENCY STAT SCI+1983::SYMMETRY MODELS AND HYPOTHESES FOR STRUCTURED DATA LAYOUTS+DAWID, AP+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1988::MARGINALIZATION PARADOXES IN BAYESIAN AND STRUCTURAL INFERENCE+DAWID, AP; STONE, M; ZIDEK, JV+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1973::The formal posterior of a standard flat prior in Manova is incoherent+Eaton, M.

Conditional probabilistic population forecasting,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,AUG 2004,16,11,"Since policy-makers often prefer to think in terms of alternative scenarios, the question has arisen as to whether it is possible to make conditional population forecasts in a probabilistic context. This paper shows that it is both possible and useful to make these forecasts. We do this with two different kinds of examples. The first is the probabilistic analog of deterministic scenario analysis. Conditional probabilistic scenario analysis is essential for policy-makers because it allows them to answer ""what if"" type questions properly when outcomes are uncertain. The second is a new category that we call ""future jump-off date forecasts"". Future jump-off date forecasts are valuable because they show policy-makers the likelihood that crucial features of today's forecasts will also be present in forecasts made in the future.","forecasting,population forecasting,probabilistic forecasting,scenarios,scenario analysis","WORLD-POPULATION,PROJECTIONS","Sanderson, WC@SUNY Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA@Austrian Acad Sci, Vienna Inst Demog, Laxenburg, Austria@Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Laxenburg, Austria@Brown Univ, Inst Int Studies, Providence, RI 02912 USA@Austrian Acad Sci, Vienna Inst Demog, A-1010 Vienna, Austria::Scherbov, S@SUNY Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA@Austrian Acad Sci, Vienna Inst Demog, Laxenburg, Austria@Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Laxenburg, Austria@Brown Univ, Inst Int Studies, Providence, RI 02912 USA@Austrian Acad Sci, Vienna Inst Demog, A-1010 Vienna, Austria::O'Neill, BC@SUNY Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA@Austrian Acad Sci, Vienna Inst Demog, Laxenburg, Austria@Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Laxenburg, Austria@Brown Univ, Inst Int Studies, Providence, RI 02912 USA@Austrian Acad Sci, Vienna Inst Demog, A-1010 Vienna, Austria::Lutz, W@SUNY Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA@Austrian Acad Sci, Vienna Inst Demog, Laxenburg, Austria@Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Laxenburg, Austria@Brown Univ, Inst Int Studies, Providence, RI 02912 USA@Austrian Acad Sci, Vienna Inst Demog, A-1010 Vienna, Austria","Sanderson, WC@State University of New York (SUNY) System@State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook@Austrian Academy of Sciences@International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)@Brown University@Austrian Academy of Sciences::Scherbov, S@State University of New York (SUNY) System@State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook@Austrian Academy of Sciences@International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)@Brown University@Austrian Academy of Sciences::O'Neill, BC@State University of New York (SUNY) System@State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook@Austrian Academy of Sciences@International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)@Brown University@Austrian Academy of Sciences::Lutz, W@State University of New York (SUNY) System@State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook@Austrian Academy of Sciences@International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)@Brown University@Austrian Academy of Sciences","O'Neill, Brian@E-6531-2013","STOCHASTIC METHODS IN POPULATION FORECASTING+ALHO, JM+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+1990::UNCERTAIN POPULATION FORECASTING+ALHO, JM; SPENCER, BD+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1985::Scenarios, uncertainty and conditional forecasts of the world population+Alho, JM+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1997::no title+KEILMAN N+DEMOGRAPHIC RES+2002::Probabilistic approaches to population forecasting.+Lee, RD.+Frontiers of Population Forecasting A Supplement to Vol 24,1998, Population and Development Review+1999::STOCHASTIC POPULATION FORECASTS FOR THE UNITED-STATES - BEYOND HIGH, MEDIUM, AND LOW+LEE, RD; TULJAPURKAR, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1994::An expert-based framework for probabilistic national population projections: The example of Austria+Lutz, W; Scherbov, S+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POPULATION-REVUE EUROPEENNE DE DEMOGRAPHIE+MAR 1998::no title+LUTZ W+IR02052 IIASA+2002::The end of world population growth+Lutz, W; Sanderson, W; Scherbov, S+NATURE+AUG 2 2001::Probabilistic population projections based on expert opinion+Lutz, W.; Sanderson, W.; Scherbov, S.+The future population of the world: What can we assume today?+1996::no title+LUTZ W+WP9557 IIASA+1995::The IIASA world population scenarios to 2030+Lutz, Wolfgang; Prinz, Christopher; Langgassner, Jeannette+The future population of the world: What can we assume today+1994::Conditional probabilistic population projections: An application to climate change+O'Neill, BC+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+AUG 2004::CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS FOR POPULATION PROJECTIONS BASED ON MONTE-CARLO METHODS+PFLAUMER, P+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+1988::no title+SANDERSON WC+END WORLD POPULATION+2004::The curious role of ""learning"" in climate policy: Should we wait for more data?+Webster, M+ENERGY JOURNAL+2002"
Conditional probabilistic population projections: An application to climate change,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,AUG 2004,25,20,"Future changes in population size, composition, and spatial distribution are key factors in the analysis of climate change, and their future evolution is highly uncertain. In climate change analyses, population uncertainty has traditionally been accounted for by using alternative scenarios spanning a range of outcomes. This paper illustrates how conditional probabilistic projections offer a means of combining probabilistic approaches with the scenario-based approach typically employed in the development of greenhouse gas emissions projections. The illustration combines a set of emissions scenarios developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) with existing probabilistic population projections from IIASA. Results demonstrate that conditional probabilistic projections have the potential to account more fully for uncertainty in emissions within conditional storylines about future development patterns, to provide a context for judging the consistency of individual scenarios with a given storyline, and to provide insight into relative likelihoods across storylines, at least from a demographic perspective. They may also serve as a step toward more comprehensive quantification of uncertainty in emissions projections.","population,projection,uncertainty,scenario,climate change","WORLD-POPULATION,UNCERTAINTY,EMISSIONS","O'Neill, BC@Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria@Brown Univ, Watson Inst Int Studies, Providence, RI 02912 USA","O'Neill, BC@International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)@Brown University","O'Neill, Brian@E-6531-2013","Scenarios, uncertainty and conditional forecasts of the world population+Alho, JM+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1997::no title+CUBASCH+CLIMATE CHANGE 2001+2001::Climatic implications of revised IPCC emission scenarios, the Kyoto Protocol and quantification of uncertainties+Dessai, S; Hulme, M.+Integrated Assess+2001::Effects of population and affluence on CO2 emissions+Dietz, T; Rosa, EA+PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA+JAN 7 1997::no title+Edmonds, J.

Random scenario forecasts versus stochastic forecasts,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,AUG 2004,16,6,"Probabilistic population forecasts are useful because they describe uncertainty in a quantitatively useful way. One approach (that we call LT) uses historical data to estimate stochastic models (e.g., a time series model) of vital rates, and then makes forecasts. Another (we call it RS) began as a kind of randomized scenario: we consider its simplest variant, in which expert opinion is used to make probability distributions for terminal vital rates, and smooth trajectories are followed over time. We use analysis and examples to show several key differences between these methods: serial correlations in the forecast are much smaller in LT; the variance in LT models of vital rates (especially fertility) is much higher than in RS models that are based on official expert scenarios; trajectories in LT are much more irregular than in RS; probability intervals in LT tend to widen faster over forecast time. Newer versions of RS have been developed that reduce or eliminate some of these differences.","probabilistic forecast,population forecast,trajectory,vital rates,scenario,random scenario,dependency ratio","POPULATION PROJECTIONS,CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS,UNITED-STATES","Tuljapurkar, S@Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA@Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94305 USA@Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA::Lee, RD@Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA@Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94305 USA@Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA::Li, Q@Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA@Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94305 USA@Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Tuljapurkar, S@Stanford University@University of California Berkeley@University of California System@Stanford University::Lee, RD@Stanford University@University of California Berkeley@University of California System@Stanford University::Li, Q@Stanford University@University of California Berkeley@University of California System@Stanford University",not exist,"STOCHASTIC METHODS IN POPULATION FORECASTING+ALHO, JM+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+1990::UNCERTAIN POPULATION FORECASTING+ALHO, JM; SPENCER, BD+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1985::no title+ANDERSON M+1999 C RET RES CTR R+1999::POPULATION FORECASTS AND CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS FOR SWEDEN - A COMPARISON OF MODEL-BASED AND EMPIRICAL APPROACHES+COHEN, JE+DEMOGRAPHY+FEB 1986::How accurate are the United Nations world population projections?+Keilman, N+POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW+1998::THE LIMITS OF POPULATION FORECASTING+KEYFITZ, N+POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW+1981::no title+LEE R+J AM STAT ASSOC+2000::no title+Lee, R.+Population and Development Review, 1999 Rethinking Population Projections+1999::STOCHASTIC POPULATION FORECASTS FOR THE UNITED-STATES - BEYOND HIGH, MEDIUM, AND LOW+LEE, RD; TULJAPURKAR, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1994::The end of world population growth+Lutz, W; Sanderson, W; Scherbov, S+NATURE+AUG 2 2001::Doubling of world population unlikely+Lutz, W; Sanderson, W; Scherbov, S+NATURE+JUN 19 1997::Probabilistic population projections based on expert opinion+Lutz, W.; Sanderson, W.; Scherbov, S.+The future population of the world: What can we assume today?+1996::FORECASTING UNITED-STATES POPULATION TOTALS WITH THE BOX-JENKINS APPROACH+PFLAUMER, P+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+NOV 1992::CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS FOR POPULATION PROJECTIONS BASED ON MONTE-CARLO METHODS+PFLAUMER, P+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+1988::THE ACCURACY OF POPULATION PROJECTIONS+STOTO, MA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1983::no title+*US SOC SEC ADM+1996 OASDI TRUST REP+1996"
Developing official stochastic population forecasts at the US Census Bureau,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,AUG 2004,11,4,"The U.S. Census Bureau is approaching a critical decision regarding a major facet of its methodology for forecasting the United States population. In the past, it has relied on alternative scenarios, low, medium, and high, to reflect varying interpretations of current trends in fertility, mortality, and international migration to forecast population. This approach has limitations that have been noted in the recent literature on population forecasting. Census Bureau researchers are embarking on an attempt to incorporate probabilistic reasoning to forecast prediction intervals around point forecasts to future dates. The current literature offers a choice of approaches to this problem. We are opting to employ formal time series modeling of parameters of fertility, mortality, and international migration, with stochastic renewal processes. The endeavor is complicated by the administrative necessity to produce a large amount of racial and Hispanic origin detail in the population, as well as the ubiquitous cross-categories of age and sex. As official population forecasts must meet user demand, we are faced with the added challenge of presenting and supporting the resulting product in a way that is comprehensible to users, many of whom have little or no comprehension of the technical forecasting literature, and are accustomed to simple, deterministic answers. We may well find a need to modify our strategy, depending on the realities that may emerge from the limitations of data, the administrative requirements of the product, and the diverse needs of our user community.","stochastic forecasting,racial disaggregation,Hispanic origin,composition effects,user demand","UNITED-STATES,PROJECTIONS","Long, JF@US Bur Census, Washington, DC 20233 USA::Hollmann, FW@US Bur Census, Washington, DC 20233 USA","Long, JF@Unknow::Hollmann, FW@Unknow",not exist,"Introduction: The need to rethink approaches to population forecasts+Ahlburg, DA; Lutz, W+POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW+1998::THE LIMITS OF POPULATION FORECASTING+KEYFITZ, N+POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW+1981::no title+KOHLER HP+2001001 M PLANCK I D+2001::STOCHASTIC POPULATION FORECASTS FOR THE UNITED-STATES - BEYOND HIGH, MEDIUM, AND LOW+LEE, RD; TULJAPURKAR, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1994::MODELING AND FORECASTING UNITED-STATES MORTALITY+LEE, RD; CARTER, LR+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1992::Probabilistic approaches to population forecasting+Lee, RD+POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW+1998::no title+LONG JF+FUTURE DEMOGRAPHIC T+1989::UNITED-STATES NATIONAL-POPULATION PROJECTIONS METHODS - A VIEW FROM 4 FORECASTING TRADITIONS+LONG, JF+INSURANCE MATHEMATICS &amp; ECONOMICS+1984::Expert-based probabilistic population projections+Lutz, W; Sanderson, WC; Scherbov, S+POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW+1998::no title+LUTZ W+POPULATION DEV REV S+1998::THE ACCURACY OF POPULATION PROJECTIONS+STOTO, MA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1983"

Corbelled domes in two and three dimensions: The treasury of Atreus,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,AUG 2004,16,1,"Before the development of the true dome, many ancient cultures used the technique of corbelling to roof spaces. Recently, a series of related statistical models have been proposed in the literature for explaining how corbelled domes might have been constructed. The most sophisticated of these models is based on a piecewise linear structure, with an unknown number of changepoints, to guide the building process. This model is analyzed by the reversible jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique. All models considered to date have been two-dimensional, that is, they have taken a single cross section through the dome; even when more extensive data, in the form of measurements on multiple slices through the dome, have been available, these have been averaged together for the purposes of analysis. In this paper, we extend the two-dimensional analysis to a three-dimensional analysis, that takes full advantage of the data collected by the archaeologists and of the rotational symmetries inherent in the structure. We also explore ways of graphically presenting the results from a complex, reversible jump MCMC implementation, in order to check convergence, good mixing, and appropriate exploration of the (high dimensional and varying dimension) parameter space. The model and the graphical techniques are demonstrated on the Treasury of Atreus in Mycenae, Greece, one of the finest extant examples of the corbelling method.","archaeology,Bayesian data analysis,graphical representation,multiple changepoint,reversible jump MCMC,statistical modeling","MARGINAL LIKELIHOOD,2-PHASE REGRESSION,OUTPUT,INFERENCE","Lazar, NA@Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Stat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA@Univ Nottingham, Dept Archaeol, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England@Univ Nottingham, Sch Math Sci, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England::Kadane, JB@Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Stat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA@Univ Nottingham, Dept Archaeol, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England@Univ Nottingham, Sch Math Sci, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England::Chen, F@Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Stat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA@Univ Nottingham, Dept Archaeol, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England@Univ Nottingham, Sch Math Sci, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England::Cavanagh, WG@Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Stat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA@Univ Nottingham, Dept Archaeol, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England@Univ Nottingham, Sch Math Sci, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England::Litton, CD@Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Stat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA@Univ Nottingham, Dept Archaeol, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England@Univ Nottingham, Sch Math Sci, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England","Lazar, NA@Carnegie Mellon University@University of Nottingham@University of Nottingham::Kadane, JB@Carnegie Mellon University@University of Nottingham@University of Nottingham::Chen, F@Carnegie Mellon University@University of Nottingham@University of Nottingham::Cavanagh, WG@Carnegie Mellon University@University of Nottingham@University of Nottingham::Litton, CD@Carnegie Mellon University@University of Nottingham@University of Nottingham",not exist,"no title+BUCK CE+STATISTICIAN+1993::EXPLAINING THE GIBBS SAMPLER+CASELLA, G; GEORGE, EI+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 1992::no title+CAVANAGH WG+PACT+1985::Marginal likelihood from the Metropolis-Hastings output+Chib, S; Jeliazkov, I+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2001::Marginal likelihood from the Gibbs output+Chib, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1995::Automatic Bayesian curve fitting+Denison, DGT; Mallick, BK; Smith, AFM+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1998::Computing Bayes factors by combining simulation and asymptotic approximations+DiCiccio, TJ; Kass, RE; Raftery, A; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1997::Bayesian modelling of prehistoric corbelled domes+Fan, Y; Brooks, SP+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES D-THE STATISTICIAN+2000::Reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo computation and Bayesian model determination+Green, PJ+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1995::INFERENCE ABOUT INTERSECTION IN 2-PHASE REGRESSION+HINKLEY, DV+BIOMETRIKA+1969::INFERENCE IN 2-PHASE REGRESSION+HINKLEY, DV+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1971::Movies for the visualization of MCMC output+Lazar, NA; Kadane, JB+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+DEC 2002::Simulating ratios of normalizing constants via a simple identity: A theoretical exploration+Meng, XL; Wong, WH+STATISTICA SINICA+OCT 1996::no title+Raiffa, Howard; Schlaifer, Robert.+Applied Statistical Decision Theory+2000::On Bayesian analysis of mixtures with an unknown number of components+Richardson, S; Green, PJ+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1997::no title+STEPHENS DA+APPL STAT-J ROY ST C+1994"
Simple correspondence analysis: A bibliographic review,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,AUG 2004,0,55,"Over the past few decades correspondence analysis has gained an international reputation as a powerful statistical tool for the graphical analysis of contingency tables. This popularity stems from its development and application in many European countries, especially France, and its use has spread to English speaking nations such as the United States and the United Kingdom. Its growing popularity amongst statistical practitioners, and more recently those disciplines where the role of statistics is less dominant, demonstrates the importance of the continuing research and development of the methodology.

The aim of this paper is to highlight the theoretical, practical and computational issues of simple correspondence analysis and discuss its relationship with recent advances that can be used to graphically display the association in two-way categorical data.","computing issues,correspondence analysis family,graphical displays,inertia,ordered categories,orthogonal polynomials,Pearson ratio,profile,reconstitution model,singular value decomposition,transition formula,two-way contingency table",,"Beh, EJ@Univ Western Sydney, Sch Quantitat Methods & Math Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Beh, EJ@Western Sydney University",not exist,
"Official statistics - Pressures and challenges ISI president's invited lecture, 2003",INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,APR 2004,8,6,"The paper considers the pressures faced by official statistics at the present time. As such, its emphasis is on current rather than intrinsic (time independent) issues. It discusses the six specific challenges. (1) Trust. Declining social trust poses a particular problem since their output would become close to useless without trust in statistical agencies (both in their professional competence and in their integrity to safeguard the statistical system from inappropriate political interference). However, this represents not only a pressure, but also an opportunity: governments' response to declining trust is more transparency and evidence-based decision making, which however requires trusted ""information brokers"". Possible responses to this opportunity are discussed. (2) Privacy. Developments in information technology and the pervasive character of the Internet have sharpened concerns about privacy. Yet, our role as ""information brokers"" critically depends on intensive exploitation of administrative records and their linkage with survey information. How we respond to this challenge will be a key determinant of our increasing or declining usefulness. (3) Social statistics. Social statistics are relatively underdeveloped-yet they are to inform decisions in an area that in most countries accounts the bulk of government expenditures. In order to be more relevant, we must shift our emphasis from measuring inputs and processes to illuminating outcomes and their underlying dynamics. Some examples of Canadian responses in this area are described. (4) Economic statistics and globalisation. There is a tension between our activities which are national in scope, and the activities of multinational corporations. The paper explores some ideas for coping with these challenges. (5). Environment statistics. While underdeveloped in most countries, the Kyoto accords and heightened interest in sustainability provide significant opportunities.

Using the Lee-Carter method to forecast mortality for populations with limited data,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,APR 2004,16,36,"The Lee-Carter method for modeling and forecasting mortality has been shown to work quite well given long time series of data. Here we consider how it can be used when there are few observations at uneven intervals. Assuming that the underlying model is correct and that the mortality index follows a random walk with drift, we find the method can be used with sparse data. The central forecast depends mainly on the first and last observation, and so can be generated with just two observations, preferably not too close in time. With three data points, uncertainty can also be estimated, although such estimates of uncertainty are themselves highly uncertain and improve with additional observations. We apply the methods to China and South Korea, which have 3 and 20 data points, respectively, at uneven intervals.","mortality forecast,limited data,Lee-Carter method",,"Li, N@Max Planck Inst Demog Res, D-18057 Rostock, Germany@Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA@Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA::Lee, R@Max Planck Inst Demog Res, D-18057 Rostock, Germany@Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA@Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA::Tuljapurkar, S@Max Planck Inst Demog Res, D-18057 Rostock, Germany@Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA@Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Li, N@Max Planck Society@University of California System@University of California Berkeley@Stanford University::Lee, R@Max Planck Society@University of California System@University of California Berkeley@Stanford University::Tuljapurkar, S@Max Planck Society@University of California System@University of California Berkeley@Stanford University",not exist,"no title+Agresti, A.; Finlay, B.+Statistical methods for the social sciences+1997::Comparing and assessing time series methods for forecasting age-specific fertility and mortality rates+Bell, W.R.+J.

Mortality forecasting and trend shifts: an application of the Lee-Carter model to Swedish mortality data,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2004.tb00222.x,APR 2004,5,17,"In this paper we examine how the Lee-Carter model fares with Swedish data for the period 1901-2001 and for segments of this period. We have choosen to censor ages less than age 40 as those ages only are of marginal interest to the forecast. At age 40 some 98 to 99 percent of the birth cohorts are survivors. In the study we only consider the unweighted k(t) estimates. The Lee-Carter model provides very good fits to the data. When splitting up the base period there seems to be an interaction beween the age and time components of the model. In order to deal with the different phases of falling mortality for males and females possibly one should choose the past 25 years as a base in the model. Selecting the base period is however a judgmental issue depending on the main focus of the forecast. Is it long-term, short-term or, as in Sweden, a combination of both?.","mortality,forecasting,Lee-Carter model,trend shifts",,"Lundstrom, H@Stat Sweden, Stockholm, Sweden::Qvist, J@Stat Sweden, Stockholm, Sweden","Lundstrom, H@Unknow::Qvist, J@Unknow",not exist,"no title+BOOTH H+AGE TIME INTERACTION+2002::no title+CARTER LR+2001007 MPIDR WP+2001::SOME APPLICATIONS OF SINGULAR DECOMPOSITION OF A MATRIX+GOOD, IJ+TECHNOMETRICS+1969::MODELING AND FORECASTING UNITED-STATES MORTALITY+LEE, RD; CARTER, LR+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1992::Computational methods for fitting and extrapolating the Lee-Carter model of mortality change+Wilmoth, J.

Toward a new model for probabilistic household forecasts,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,APR 2004,46,4,"Household projections are key components of analyses of several issues of social concern, including the welfare of the elderly, housing, and environmentally significant consumption patterns. Researchers or policy makers that use such projections need appropriate representations of uncertainty in order to inform their analyses. However, the weaknesses of the traditional approach of providing alternative variants to single ""best guess"" projection are magnified in household projections, which have many output variables of interest, and many input variables beyond fertility, mortality, and migration. We review current methods of household projections and the potential for using them to produce probabilistic projections, which would address many of these weaknesses. We then propose a new framework for a household projection method of intermediate complexity that we believe is a good candidate for providing a basis for further development of probabilistic household projections. An extension of the traditional headship rate approach, this method is based on modelling changes in headship rates decomposed by household size as a function of variables describing demographic events such as parity specific fertility, union formation and dissolution, and leaving home. It has moderate data requirements, manageable complexity, allows for direct specification of demographic events, and produces output that includes the most important household characteristics for many applications. An illustration of how such a model might be constructed, using data on the U.S. and China over the past several decades, demonstrates the viability of the approach.","model,probabilistic forecast,household","BIODIVERSITY,DYNAMICS,HEADSHIP","Leiwen, J@Brown Univ, Watson Inst Int Studies, Providence, RI 02912 USA@Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria::O'Neill, BC@Brown Univ, Watson Inst Int Studies, Providence, RI 02912 USA@Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria","Leiwen, J@Brown University@International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)::O'Neill, BC@Brown University@International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)","O'Neill, Brian@E-6531-2013","no title+ALDERS M+MAANDSTATISTIEK BEVO+2001::no title+ALHO, J.M.+A stochastic forecast of the population of Finland+1998::no title+BIANCHI SM+POPULATION B+2000::Living arrangements of older adults in the developing world: an analysis of DHS household surveys+Bongaarts, J.; Zimmer, Z.+Policy Research Division Working Paper No. 148+2001::no title+CALDWELL SB+PAPERS REGIONAL SCI+1979::DETERMINANTS OF HOUSEHOLD HEADSHIP+CARLINER, G+JOURNAL OF MARRIAGE AND THE FAMILY+1975::no title+DEBEER J+EUR POP C AUG 30 SEP+1999::no title+DULEY C+NIDI RUU WORKSH MULT+1988::no title+FURSTENBERG FF+ANN REV SOCIOLOGY+1990::no title+GALLER H+MODELLING HOUSEHOLD+1988::no title+GOLDSCHEIDER F+SOCIAL FORCES+1999::no title+GOLDSTEIN J+GEN C IUSSP AUG 2001+2001::no title+GONNOT JP+SOCIAL SECURITY HOUS+1995::no title+HAMMEL E+RES SERIES U CAL I I+1976::no title+HOLLMANN FW+38 US CENS BUR POP D+2000::no title+Jiang, L.+Population and Sustaianable Development in China-Population and Household Scenarios for Two Regions+1999::no title+KARL G+HUMAN SETTLEMENT STA+2000::no title+KEILMAN N+MODELLING HOUSEHOLD+1988::Biodiversity: The threat of small households+Keilman, N+NATURE+JAN 30 2003::no title+KING D+JOINT ECE EUR WORK S+1999::HOUSEHOLD HEADSHIP AND ITS CHANGES IN UNITED-STATES, 1940-1960, 1970+KOBRIN, FE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1973::Introduction: Modelling household formation and dissolution+Kuijsten, A.; Vossen, A.+Modelling household formation and dissolution+1988::no title+LEE RD+FRONTIERS POPULATION+1999::Effects of household dynamics on resource consumption and biodiversity+Liu, JG; Daily, GC; Ehrlich, PR; et al.+NATURE+JAN 30 2003::Population, households, and CO2 emissions+MacKellar, FL; Lutz, W; Prinz, C; et al.+POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW+DEC 1995::no title+MARTIN N+IR99032 IIASA+1999::Characteristic features of modern American fertility+Morgan, SP+POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW+1996::no title+MULLER C+HOUSING LIVING ARRAN+1999::HOUSEHOLD AND EDUCATION PROJECTIONS BY MEANS OF A MICROSIMULATION MODEL+NELISSEN, JHM+ECONOMIC MODELLING+OCT 1991::PROJECTING HOUSEHOLD DYNAMICS - A SCENARIO-BASED MICROSIMULATION APPROACH+NELISSEN, JHM; VOSSEN, AP+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POPULATION-REVUE EUROPEENNE DE DEMOGRAPHIE+1989::no title+O'Neill, B.C.; MacKellar, L.; Lutz, W.+Population and Climate Change+2001::Demographic determinants of household energy use in the United States+O'Neill, Brian C.; Chen, Belinda S.+POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW+2002::no title+ONEILL BC+IN PRESS INTERNAT ST+2004::no title+OSKAMP A+LOCAL HOUSING MARKET+1997::AMERICAN FAMILY DECLINE, 1960-1990 - A REVIEW AND APPRAISAL+POPENOE, D+JOURNAL OF MARRIAGE AND THE FAMILY+AUG 1993::no title+PRSKAWETZ A+GEN C IUSSP AUG 2001+2001::no title+*SEL COMM ENV+TRANSP REG AFF+1998::no title+SMITH JE+FAMILY DEMOGRAPHY ME+1987::COMPONENTS OF CHANGE IN THE NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLDS - 1970-1980+SWEET, JA+DEMOGRAPHY+1984::no title+Van Imhoff, E.; Keilman, N.+LIPRO 2.0: An application of a dynamic demographic projection model to household structure in the Netherlands+1991::no title+VANDIEPEN A+BEVOLKINGSVRAAGSTUKK+1994::no title+VANDIEPEN A+WP9563 IIASA+1995::no title+WACHTER K+SOCSIM DESCRIPTION P+1998::no title+WACHTER KW+FAMILY DEMOGRAPHY ME+1987::no title+ZENG Y+FRONTIERS POPULATION+1999::no title+ZENG Y+MATH POPULATION STUI+1997"
Assumptions on fertility in stochastic population forecasts,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,APR 2004,17,7,"In recent years Statistics Netherlands has published several stochastic population forecasts. The degree of uncertainty of the future population is assessed on the basis of assumptions about the probability distribution of future fertility, mortality and migration. The assumptions on fertility are based on an analysis of historic forecasts of the total fertility rate (TFR), on time-series models of observations of the TFR, and on expert knowledge. This latter argument-based approach refers to the TFR distinguished by birth order. In the most recent Dutch forecast the 95 % forecast interval of the total fertility rate in 2050 is assumed to range from 1.2 to 2.3 children per woman.","stochastic population forecasts,uncertainty,expert knowledge,fertility",,"Alders, M@State Netherlands, Dept Stat Anal, Woorburg, Netherlands::de Beer, J@State Netherlands, Dept Stat Anal, Woorburg, Netherlands","Alders, M@Unknow::de Beer, J@Unknow",not exist,"no title+ALDERS M+M STOCH MOD FOR MORT+2002::no title+ALHO, J.M.+A stochastic forecast of the population of Finland+1998::no title+BOX GEP+TIME SERIES ANAL+1970::no title+DEBEER J+J OFF STAT+1997::no title+DEBEER J+JOINT ECE EUR WORK S+1999::no title+DEGRAAF A+MAANDSTATISTIEK BEVO+1999::no title+DEJONG A+MAANDSTATISTIEK BEVO+2001::no title+DEJONG AH+BSPS NVD URUR C 21 A+2000::no title+Harvey, A.

Probabilistic population projections for India with explicit consideration of the education-fertility link,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,APR 2004,7,7,"Among the different sources of uncertainty in population forecasting, uncertain changes in the structure of heterogeneous populations have received little attention so far, although they can have significant impacts. Here we focus on the effect of changes in the educational composition of the population on the overall fertility of the population in the presence of strong fertility differentials by education. With data from India we show that alternative paths of future female enrolment in education result in significantly different total fertility rates (TFR) for the country over the coming decades, even assuming identical fertility trends within each education group. These results from multi-state population projections by education are then translated into a fully probabilistic population projection for India in which the results of alternative education scenarios are assumed to expand the uncertainty range of the future TFR in the total population.

This first attempt to endogenize structural change with respect to education-which is the greatest measurable source of fertility heterogeneity in Asia-has resulted from a larger exercise of the Asian MetaCentre for Population and Sustainable Development Analysis to collect empirical information, scientific arguments as well as informed opinions about likely future population trends in Asia from a large number of population experts in the region. In this process, future changes in the educational composition of the population have been identified as a key driver of future fertility.

The actual probabilistic population projections for India show that with high certainty, the Indian population will continue to grow to about 1.3 billion over the next quarter of a century. After that the uncertainty will get much wider, ranging from a continued strong increase to the beginning of a population decline in India.","India,population,education,projections,uncertainty",,"Lutz, W@Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria@Austrian Acad Sci, Vienna Inst Demog, A-1010 Vienna, Austria::Scherbov, S@Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria@Austrian Acad Sci, Vienna Inst Demog, A-1010 Vienna, Austria","Lutz, W@International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)@Austrian Academy of Sciences::Scherbov, S@International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)@Austrian Academy of Sciences",not exist,"China's future urban and rural population by level of education+Cao, G.-Y.; Lutz, W.+The end of world population growth in the 21st century: New challenges for human capital formation and sustainable development+2004::Expert-based probabilistic population projections+Lutz, W; Sanderson, WC; Scherbov, S.+Frontiers of Population Forecasting A Supplement to Vol 24,1998, Population and Development Review+1999::no title+LUTZ W+IR03014 INT I APPL S+2003::The end of population growth in Asia+Lutz, W.; Scherbov, S.; Sanderson, W.+Journal of Population Research+2003::The end of world population growth+Lutz, W; Sanderson, W; Scherbov, S+NATURE+AUG 2 2001::The world's changing human capital stock: Multi-state population projections by educational attainment+Lutz, W; Goujon, A+POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW+JUN 2001::no title+Lutz, W.; Sanderson, W.

"Confidence Distribution, the Frequentist Distribution Estimator of a Parameter: A Review",INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12000,APR 2013,85,56,"In frequentist inference, we commonly use a single point (point estimator) or an interval (confidence interval/""interval estimator"") to estimate a parameter of interest. A very simple question is: Can we also use a distribution function (""distribution estimator"") to estimate a parameter of interest in frequentist inference in the style of a Bayesian posterior? The answer is affirmative, and confidence distribution is a natural choice of such a ""distribution estimator"". The concept of a confidence distribution has a long history, and its interpretation has long been fused with fiducial inference. Historically, it has been misconstrued as a fiducial concept, and has not been fully developed in the frequentist framework. In recent years, confidence distribution has attracted a surge of renewed attention, and several developments have highlighted its promising potential as an effective inferential tool.

This article reviews recent developments of confidence distributions, along with a modern definition and interpretation of the concept. It includes distributional inference based on confidence distributions and its extensions, optimality issues and their applications. Based on the new developments, the concept of a confidence distribution subsumes and unifies a wide range of examples, from regular parametric (fiducial distribution) examples to bootstrap distributions, significance (p-value) functions, normalized likelihood functions, and, in some cases, Bayesian priors and posteriors. The discussion is entirely within the school of frequentist inference, with emphasis on applications providing useful statistical inference tools for problems where frequentist methods with good properties were previously unavailable or could not be easily obtained. Although it also draws attention to some of the differences and similarities among frequentist, fiducial and Bayesian approaches, the review is not intended to re-open the philosophical debate that has lasted more than two hundred years. On the contrary, it is hoped that the article will help bridge the gaps between these different statistical procedures.","Confidence distribution,statistical inference,fiducial distribution,Bayesian method,likelihood function,estimation theory","STATISTICAL-INFERENCE,INTERVALS,METAANALYSIS,LIKELIHOOD,BOOTSTRAP,CURVES,BAYES,POSTERIOR,TRIALS,TESTS","Xie, Min-ge@Rutgers State Univ, Dept Stat & Biostat, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA::Singh, Kesar@Rutgers State Univ, Dept Stat & Biostat, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA","Xie, Min-ge@Rutgers State University New Brunswick::Singh, Kesar@Rutgers State University New Brunswick",not exist,"INFERENCE ON MEANS USING THE BOOTSTRAP+BABU, GJ; SINGH, K+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1983::no title+Barndorff-Nielsen, O.

Multi-state Stochastic Processes: A Statistical Flowgraph Perspective,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2012.00193.x,APR 2013,91,1,"Two-state models (working/failed or alive/dead) are widely used in reliability and survival analysis. In contrast, multi-state stochastic processes provide a richer framework for modeling and analyzing the progression of a process from an initial to a terminal state, allowing incorporation of more details of the process mechanism. We review multi-state models, focusing on time-homogeneous semi-Markov processes (SMPs), and then describe the statistical flowgraph framework, which comprises analysis methods and algorithms for computing quantities of interest such as the distribution of first passage times to a terminal state. These algorithms algebraically combine integral transforms of the waiting time distributions in each state and invert them to get the required results. The estimated transforms may be based on parametric distributions or on empirical distributions of sample transition data, which may be censored. The methods are illustrated with several applications.","Censored data,empirical transform,Laplace transform,saddlepoint approximation,semi-Markov process,transform inversion","MARKOV RENEWAL PROCESSES,SADDLEPOINT APPROXIMATIONS,NONPARAMETRIC-ESTIMATION,LAPLACE TRANSFORM,MODELS,SYSTEMS,DISTRIBUTIONS","Collins, David H.@Los Alamos Natl Lab, Stat Sci Grp, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA::Huzurbazar, Aparna V.@Los Alamos Natl Lab, Stat Sci Grp, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA","Collins, David H.@United States Department of Energy (DOE)@Los Alamos National Laboratory::Huzurbazar, Aparna V.@United States Department of Energy (DOE)@Los Alamos National Laboratory",not exist,"An introduction to survival and event history analysis+Aalen, Odd O.; Borgan, Ornulf; Gjessing, Hakon K.+SURVIVAL AND EVENT HISTORY ANALYSIS: A PROCESS POINT OF VIEW+2008::The Fourier-series method for inverting transforms of probability distributions+Abate, J.; Whitt, W.+Queueing Systems Theory and Applications+1992::no title+Andersen,, P.

Applications of the Likelihood Theory in Finance: Modelling and Pricing,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2012.00197.x,APR 2013,31,1,"This paper discusses the connection between mathematical finance and statistical modelling which turns out to be more than a formal mathematical correspondence. We like to figure out how common results and notions in statistics and their meaning can be translated to the world of mathematical finance and vice versa. A lot of similarities can be expressed in terms of LeCam's theory for statistical experiments which is the theory of the behaviour of likelihood processes. For positive prices the arbitrage free financial assets fit into statistical experiments. It is shown that they are given by filtered likelihood ratio processes. From the statistical point of view, martingale measures, completeness, and pricing formulas are revisited. The pricing formulas for various options are connected with the power functions of tests. For instance the Black-Scholes price of a European option is related to Neyman-Pearson tests and it has an interpretation as Bayes risk. Under contiguity the convergence of financial experiments and option prices are obtained. In particular, the approximation of Ito type price processes by discrete models and the convergence of associated option prices is studied. The result relies on the central limit theorem for statistical experiments, which is well known in statistics in connection with local asymptotic normal (LAN) families. As application certain continuous time option prices can be approximated by related discrete time pricing formulas.","Statistical experiment,filtered likelihood ratio process,martingale measure,pricing formula,Bayes risk,Neyman-Pearson test,completeness,contiguity,local asymptotic normality","ROBUST UTILITY FUNCTIONALS,CONVERGENCE","Janssen, Arnold@Univ Dusseldorf, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany::Tietje, Martin@Univ Dusseldorf, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany","Janssen, Arnold@Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf::Tietje, Martin@Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf",not exist,"no title+Andersen, P; Borgen, O; Gill, R<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Kieding, N</span>.+Statistical Models Based on Counting Processes.

A Review on Dimension Reduction,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2012.00182.x,APR 2013,84,22,"Summarizing the effect of many covariates through a few linear combinations is an effective way of reducing covariate dimension and is the backbone of (sufficient) dimension reduction. Because the replacement of high-dimensional covariates by low-dimensional linear combinations is performed with a minimum assumption on the specific regression form, it enjoys attractive advantages as well as encounters unique challenges in comparison with the variable selection approach. We review the current literature of dimension reduction with an emphasis on the two most popular models, where the dimension reduction affects the conditional distribution and the conditional mean, respectively. We discuss various estimation and inference procedures in different levels of detail, with the intention of focusing on their underneath idea instead of technicalities. We also discuss some unsolved problems in this area for potential future research.","Dimension reduction,double robustness,efficiency bound,estimating equation,linearity condition,sliced inverse regression,sufficient dimension reduction","SLICED INVERSE REGRESSION,AVERAGE VARIANCE-ESTIMATION,PARTIAL LEAST-SQUARES,CENTRAL MEAN SUBSPACE,SINGLE-INDEX MODELS,MULTIVARIATE RESPONSES,DISTRIBUTED PREDICTORS,DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS,LINEAR-REGRESSION,ORACLE PROPERTIES","Ma, Yanyuan@Texas A&M Univ, Dept Stat, College Stn, TX 77843 USA::Zhu, Liping@Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat & Management, Key Lab Math Econ SUFE, Minist Educ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China","Ma, Yanyuan@Texas A&M University College Station@Texas A&M University System::Zhu, Liping@Shanghai University of Finance & Economics",not exist,"Sufficient dimension reduction and prediction in regression+Adragni, Kofi P.; Cook, R.

Statistical Disclosure Risk: Separating Potential and Harm,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2012.00194.x,DEC 2012,62,3,"Statistical agencies are keen to devise ways to provide research access to data while protecting confidentiality. Although methods of statistical disclosure risk assessment are now well established in the statistical science literature, the integration of these methods by agencies into a general scientific basis for their practice still proves difficult. This paper seeks to review and clarify the role of statistical science in the conceptual foundations of disclosure risk assessment in an agency's decision making. Disclosure risk is broken down into disclosure potential, a measure of the ability to achieve true disclosure, and disclosure harm. It is argued that statistical science is most suited to assessing the former. A framework for this assessment is presented. The paper argues that the intruder's decision making and behaviour may be separated from this framework, provided appropriate account is taken of the nature of potential intruder attacks in the definition of disclosure potential.","Confidentiality,disclosure limitation,identification,intruder","LIMITED DATA DISSEMINATION,SURVEY PARTICIPATION,SURVEY MICRODATA,RECORD LINKAGE,CONFIDENTIALITY,IDENTIFICATION,LIMITATION,PRIVACY,UTILITY,FRAMEWORK","Skinner, Chris@Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Stat, London WC2A 2AE, England","Skinner, Chris@University of London@London School Economics & Political Science",not exist,"First issue editorial+Abowd, JM; Nissim, K; Skinner, CJ.+J.

"Evaluating, Comparing, Monitoring, and Improving Representativeness of Survey Response Through R-Indicators and Partial R-Indicators",INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2012.00189.x,DEC 2012,9,14,"Non-response is a common source of error in many surveys. Because surveys often are costly instruments, quality-cost trade-offs play a continuing role in the design and analysis of surveys. The advances of telephone, computers, and Internet all had and still have considerable impact on the design of surveys. Recently, a strong focus on methods for survey data collection monitoring and tailoring has emerged as a new paradigm to efficiently reduce non-response error. Paradata and adaptive survey designs are key words in these new developments. Prerequisites to evaluating, comparing, monitoring, and improving quality of survey response are a conceptual framework for representative survey response, indicators to measure deviations thereof, and indicators to identify subpopulations that need increased effort. In this paper, we present an overview of representativeness indicators or R-indicators that are fit for these purposes. We give several examples and provide guidelines for their use in practice.","Adaptive survey design,non-response,non-response reduction,paradata,representativity","MICRODATA,RISK","Schouten, Barry@Stat Netherlands, The Hague, Netherlands::Bethlehem, Jelke@Stat Netherlands, The Hague, Netherlands::Beullens, Koen@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Louvain, Belgium::Kleven, Oyvin@Stat Norway, Oslo, Norway::Loosveldt, Geert@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Louvain, Belgium::Luiten, Annemieke@Stat Netherlands, The Hague, Netherlands::Rutar, Katja@Stat Off Republ Slovenia, Ljubljana, Slovenia::Shlomo, Natalie@Univ Southampton, Southampton, Hants, England::Skinner, Chris@Univ Southampton, Southampton, Hants, England","Schouten, Barry@Unknow::Bethlehem, Jelke@Unknow::Beullens, Koen@KU Leuven::Kleven, Oyvin@Statistics Norway::Loosveldt, Geert@KU Leuven::Luiten, Annemieke@Unknow::Rutar, Katja@Unknow::Shlomo, Natalie@University of Southampton::Skinner, Chris@University of Southampton",not exist,"How Protective Are Synthetic Data?+Abowd, John M.; Vilhuber, Lars+PRIVACY IN STATISTICAL DATABASES, PROCEEDINGS+2008::no title+no author+The 2011 Census of Population and Housing in England and Wales+2008::Measures of disclosure risk and harm+Lambert, D.+Journal of Official Statistics+1993::THE CASE FOR SAMPLES OF ANONYMIZED RECORDS FROM THE 1991 CENSUS+MARSH, C; SKINNER, C; ARBER, S; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1991::Robust de-anonymization of large sparse datasets+Narayanan, Arvind; Shmatikov, Vitaly+PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2008 IEEE SYMPOSIUM ON SECURITY AND PRIVACY+2008::Disclosure control for census microdata+Skinner, C.; Marsh, C.; Openshaw, S.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Wymer, C</span>.+Journal of Official Statistics+1994::Assessing Identification Risk in Survey Microdata Using Log-Linear Models+Skinner, Chris; Shlomo, Natalie+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2008::A measure of disclosure risk for microdata+Skinner, CJ; Elliot, MJ+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2002::no title+Willenborg, L; de Waal, T.+Elements of Statistical Disclosure Control+2001"
Assessing the Performance of Classification Methods,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2012.00183.x,DEC 2012,24,25,"A large number of measures have been developed for evaluating the performance of classification rules. Some of these have been developed to meet the practical requirements of specific applications, but many others-which here we call ""classification accuracy"" criteria-represent different ways of balancing the different kinds of misclassification which may be made. This paper reviews classification accuracy criteria. However, the literature is now so large and diverse that a comprehensive list, covering all the measures and their variants, would probably be impossible. Instead, this paper embeds such measures in general framework, spanning the possibilities, and draws attention to relationships between them. Important points to note are, firstly, that different performance measures, by definition, measure different aspects of performance; secondly, that one should therefore carefully choose a measure to match the objectives of one's study; and, thirdly, that empirical comparisons between instruments measuring different aspects are of limited value.","AUC,diagnosis,error rate,H measure,performance evaluation,ROC curve,sensitivity,signal detection,specificity,supervised classification","SURVEY NONRESPONSE,HOUSEHOLD SURVEYS,SURVEY RESPONSE,REPRESENTATIVENESS,INDICATORS,DESIGN,BIAS","Hand, David J.@Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Math, London SW7 2AZ, England","Hand, David J.@Imperial College London",not exist,"Proxy Pattern-Mixture Analysis for Survey Nonresponse+Andridge, Rebecca R.; Little, Roderick J.

Traceable regressions are sequences of conditional distributions in joint or single responses for which a corresponding graph captures an independence structure and represents, in addition, conditional dependences that permit the tracing of pathways of dependence. We give the properties needed for transforming these graphs and graphical criteria to decide whether a path in the graph induces a dependence. The much stronger constraints on distributions that are faithful to a graph are compared to those needed for traceable regressions.","Chain graphs,edge-matrix calculus,faithfulness of graphs,graphical Markov models,independence axioms,regression graphs","ROC CURVE,CLASSIFIER PERFORMANCE,DIAGNOSTIC-TESTS,SCORING RULES,AREA,PREDICTION,OVERLAP","Wermuth, Nanny@Univ Gothenburg, Dept Math, Chalmers Tech Univ, Gothenburg, Sweden@Int Agcy Res Canc, F-69372 Lyon, France","Wermuth, Nanny@World Health Organization@University of Gothenburg@Chalmers University of Technology@International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)",not exist,"Using relative utility curves to evaluate risk prediction+Baker, Stuart G.; Cook, Nancy R.; Vickers, Andrew; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+2009::The skill plot: A graphical technique for evaluating continuous diagnostic tests+Briggs, William M.; Zaretzki, Russell+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2008::AUC Optimization Vs.

Interval Estimation of Treatment Effects in Randomized Trials: When do Confidence Intervals Have Nominal Coverage?,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2012.00185.x,DEC 2012,35,1,"In the classical theory of randomized trials (RTs), the treatment effect is defined as a mean difference of potential outcomes. To achieve nominal coverage probability for confidence intervals (CIs) on treatment effects in RTs, certain assumptions are necessary. Specifically, one must either make assumptions about the joint distribution of potential outcomes or enroll subjects in the trial by random sampling of the target population on which the treatment effect is defined. In practice, no such sampling usually takes place and assumptions about the joint distribution of potential outcomes cannot be verified based on observed data. Furthermore, the most common of these assumptions, such as treatment-unit additivity (TUA) or independence are biologically implausible in most RTs involving human subjects. Hence, it is not usually possible to construct CIs on treatment effects with nominal coverage probability. However, for any joint distribution of potential outcomes, the standard estimator of the variance of the difference of two independent sample means produces CIs with asymptotic coverage at least at the nominal level. This interpretation of CIs as conservative bounds may not always hold in conventional regression models applied to RT data.","Randomized trials,confidence intervals,coverage probability,potential outcomes,treatment-unit additivity","CHAIN GRAPH MODELS,INDEPENDENCE GRAPHS,CONDITIONAL-INDEPENDENCE,TRIANGULAR SYSTEMS,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,REGRESSIONS,VARIABLES","Scosyrev, Emil@Univ Rochester, Med Ctr, Dept Urol, Rochester, NY 14642 USA","Scosyrev, Emil@University of Rochester",not exist,"MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD IN 3-WAY CONTINGENCY-TABLES+BIRCH, MW+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1963::no title+CASTILLO, E.; GUTIERREZ, J.

Bell Labs, a corporate component of the Bell System, was perhaps the premier example. The period from 1925, when Bell Labs was formed, to 1984, when the Bell System was broken up following a government antitrust lawsuit, is of special interest because the system operated as a regulated monopoly during that period. Telephone subscribers effectively paid for research and development in their monthly phone bills, which provided an element of financial stability for the labs. Statistics research was one of many types that thrived, much to the benefit of the Bell System, its customers, and the science of statistics.

Discussion: Statistics Research in Business and Industry - The General Electric Experience,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2012.00184.x,AUG 2012,6,0,"For over 60 years, the statistics group at General Electric (GE) has used statistical methods to successfully address key company issues, both reactively and in recent years more and more proactively and holistically. Much of this work invariably calls for some degree of statistics research, including what we now call statistical engineering. We briefly review the history of research at GE, describe the accomplishments, research, and evolution of the GE statistics group over time, and present our views on the state of statistics research in business and industry.","Statistics research,statistical engineering,GE,Bell Labs",,"Hahn, Gerald J.@Unknow::Hoerl, Roger@GE Global Res Ctr, Niskayuna, NY 12309 USA::Doganaksoy, Necip@GE Global Res Ctr, Niskayuna, NY 12309 USA::Gardner, Martha@GE Global Res Ctr, Niskayuna, NY 12309 USA","Hahn, Gerald J.@Unknow::Hoerl, Roger@General Electric::Doganaksoy, Necip@General Electric::Gardner, Martha@General Electric",not exist,"Moving the Statistics Profession Forward to the Next Level+Hoerl, Roger W.; Snee, Ronald D.+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+FEB 2010::Statistics to facilitate innovation: a panel discussion+Jensen.+Qual.

The process was used and rediscovered many times, and we mention some of the early scientific areas. The name Poisson process was first used in print in 1940, and we believe the term was coined in the corridors of Stockholm University some time between 1936 and 1939. We follow the early developments of doubly stochastic processes and cluster processes, and describe different efforts to apply the Markov property to point processes.","Cluster point process,doubly stochastic Poisson process,Markov point process,Poisson process","STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS,CLUSTER MODEL,EVENTS,PATTERNS,SERIES","Guttorp, Peter@Univ Washington, Dept Stat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA@Norwegian Comp Ctr, NO-0314 Oslo, Norway::Thorarinsdottir, Thordis L.@Univ Heidelberg, Inst Appl Math, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany","Guttorp, Peter@University of Washington@University of Washington Seattle::Thorarinsdottir, Thordis L.@Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg",not exist,"no title+Andersen,, P.

We provide a unified treatment of familiar probability bounds on a union of events by Bonferroni, Galambos- R ' enyi, Dawson- Sankoff, and Chung- Erd "" os, as well as less familiar bounds by Fr ' echet and Gumbel, all of which are expressed in terms of Bonferroni sums, by showing that all these arise as bounds in a more general setting in terms of binomial moments of a general non- negative integer- valued random variable. Use of Gumbel's Identity then gives the inequalities in familiar Bonferroni sum form. This approach simplifies existing proofs. It also allows generalization of the results of Fr ' echet and Gumbel to give bounds on the probability that at least t of n events occur for any 1 <= t <= n. A further consequence of the approach is an improvement of a recent bound of Petrov which itself generalizes the Chung-Erdos bound.","Binomial moments,Bonferroni sums,factorial moments,Gumbel's Identity,linear probability inequalities,quadratic inequalities","BOOLE INEQUALITY,PROBABILITY,BOUNDS,EVENTS","Hoppe, Fred M.@McMaster Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada::Seneta, Eugene@Univ Sydney, Sch Math & Stat, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Hoppe, Fred M.@McMaster University::Seneta, Eugene@University of Sydney",not exist,"Teoria statistica delle classi e calcolo delle probabilith+Bonferroni, C.E.+Pub.

Asymptotically Optimal Response-Adaptive Designs for Allocating the Best Treatment: An Overview,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2011.00173.x,AUG 2012,44,6,"Response-adaptive designs are being used increasingly in applications, and this is especially so in early phase clinical trials. This paper reviews a particular class of response-adaptive designs that have the property of picking the superior treatment with probability tending to one. This is a desirable property froman ethical point of view in clinical trials. The model underlying such designs is a randomly reinforced urn. This paper provides an overview of results for these designs, starting from the early paper of Durham and Yu (1990) until the recent work by Flournoy, May, Moler and Plo (2010).","Clinical trials,ethical allocation,experimental design,migrating urn,optimal allocation,randomly reinforced urns,response-adaptive designs,sequential design","RANDOMLY REINFORCED URN,CLINICAL-TRIALS,RANDOMIZATION,2-COLOR,VARIABILITY,THEOREMS,BANDITS,MODELS","Flournoy, Nancy@Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA::May, Caterina@Univ Piemonte Orientale, Novara, Italy::Secchi, Piercesare@Politecn Milan, I-20133 Milan, Italy","Flournoy, Nancy@University of Missouri System@University of Missouri Columbia::May, Caterina@University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro::Secchi, Piercesare@Polytechnic University of Milan","Secchi, Piercesare@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4048-9552","A functional equation whose unknown is P[0,1]-valued+Aletti, G.; May, C.; Secchi, P.+Technical report.

A Method to Evaluate Mode Effects on the Mean and Variance of a Continuous Variable in Mixed-Mode Surveys,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2011.00167.x,AUG 2012,34,5,"Mixed-mode surveys, in which different respondents complete the survey by different modes, become increasingly popular. That said, such surveys may lead to a confounding of two forms of mode effects, i.e., selection effects and measurement effects. Exclusive focus on mixed-mode data almost precludes disentangling both effects. In this paper, we show how this problem can be circumvented merely by comparing mixed-mode data with a comparable single-mode sample. The proposed method allows estimating the mode effects on the mean and variance of a continuous variable. As an illustration, the authors estimate mode effects on six items on opinions about surveys.","Mixed-mode,selection effect,measurement effect,mode effect,opinion about surveys","MISSING DATA,TELEPHONE,BIAS","Vannieuwenhuyze, Jorre T.

Short-Term Wind Speed Forecasting for Power System Operations,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2011.00168.x,APR 2012,69,61,"The emphasis on renewable energy and concerns about the environment have led to large-scale wind energy penetration worldwide. However, there are also significant challenges associated with the use of wind energy due to the intermittent and unstable nature of wind. High-quality short-term wind speed forecasting is critical to reliable and secure power system operations. This article begins with an overview of the current status of worldwide wind power developments and future trends. It then reviews some statistical short-term wind speed forecasting models, including traditional time series approaches and more advanced space-time statistical models. It also discusses the evaluation of forecast accuracy, in particular, the need for realistic loss functions. New challenges in wind speed forecasting regarding ramp events and offshore wind farms are also presented.","Evaluation,forecasting,loss function,ramp event,space-time model,statistical model,time series model,wind speed,wind power","TIME-SERIES MODELS,PROBABILISTIC FORECASTS,SPATIAL CORRELATION,POINT FORECASTS,ENERGY,PREDICTION,DISTRIBUTIONS,GENERATION,ACCURACY,SIMULATE","Zhu, Xinxin@Texas A&M Univ, Dept Stat, College Stn, TX 77843 USA::Genton, Marc G.@Texas A&M Univ, Dept Stat, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Zhu, Xinxin@Texas A&M University College Station@Texas A&M University System::Genton, Marc G.@Texas A&M University College Station@Texas A&M University System",not exist,"Wind speed and power forecasting based on spatial correlation models+Alexiadis, MC; Dokopoulos, PS; Sahsamanoglou, HS+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENERGY CONVERSION+SEP 1999::no title+no author+Wind power forecasting: state-of-the-art 2009+2009::2010 China wind power outlook+[Anonymous].+Chinese Renewable Energy Industries Association (CREIA) report+Oct.  2010::no title+Armstrong, Scott J.+Long-Range Forecasting: From Crystal Ball to Computer+1985::no title+no author+U.S. Wind industry annual market report year ending 2009+2009::Robust likelihood methods based on the skew-t and related distributions+Azzalini, Adelchi; Genton, Marc G.+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+APR 2008::Qualification of wind power forecasts+Bofinger, S.; Luig, A.; Beyer, H.

The analysis of real data provides a deeper insight into the behaviour of gas in-and outflow. Several models for describing dependence between the maximal daily gas flow and the temperature on network exits are proposed. A modified sigmoidal regression is chosen from the class of parametric models. As an alternative, a semi-parametric regression model based on penalized splines is considered. The comparison of models and the forecast of gas loads for very low temperatures based on both approaches is included.

Using Complex Surveys to Estimate the L1-Median of a Functional Variable: Application to Electricity Load Curves,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2011.00172.x,APR 2012,33,7,"Mean profiles are widely used as indicators of the electricity consumption habits of customers. Currently, in Electricite De France (EDF), class load profiles are estimated using point-wise mean profiles. Unfortunately, it is well known that the mean is highly sensitive to the presence of outliers, such as one or more consumers with unusually high-levels of consumption. In this paper, we propose an alternative to the mean profile: the L-1-median profile which is more robust. When dealing with large data sets of functional data (load curves for example), survey sampling approaches are useful for estimating the median profile avoiding storing the whole data. We propose here several sampling strategies and estimators to estimate the median trajectory. A comparison between them is illustrated by means of a test population.

We pay particular attention to the parameter which minimizes a measure of divergence to the distribution providing the data. The prior distribution reflects this attention and we discuss the application of the Bayes rule from this perspective. Our framework is fundamentally non-parametric and we are able to interpret prior distributions on the parameter space using ideas of matching loss functions, one of which is coming from the data model and the other from the prior.","Conjugate prior,Dirichlet process,Kullback-Leibler divergence,loss function,model choice,-open,prior distribution,self-information loss","POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTIONS,INFERENCE,INFORMATION,INCORRECT,BEHAVIOR","Brown, Philip J.@Univ Kent, Sch Math Stat & Actuarial Sci, Canterbury, Kent, England::Walker, Stephen G.@Univ Kent, Sch Math Stat & Actuarial Sci, Canterbury, Kent, England","Brown, Philip J.@University of Kent::Walker, Stephen G.@University of Kent",not exist,"Information-Theoretic Characterization of Bayes Performance and the Choice of Priors in Parametric and Nonparametric Problems+Barron, A.

Statistical procedures have to be modified sometimes to obtain an affine equivariant or invariant version. This is often done by preprocessing the data, e. g., by standardizing the multivariate data or by transforming the data to an invariant coordinate system (ICS). In this paper, standardization of multivariate distributions and characteristics of ICS functionals and statistics are examined. Also, invariances up to some groups of transformations are discussed. Constructions of ICS functionals are addressed. In particular, the construction based on the use of two scatter matrix functionals presented by Tyler et al. (2009) and direct definitions based on the approach presented by Chaudhuri & Sengupta (1993) are examined. Diverse applications of ICS functionals are discussed.","Invariant coordinate system functionals,multivariate analysis,nonparametric methods","MULTIVARIATE LOCATION,M-ESTIMATORS,SCATTER,TRANSFORMATION,MATRICES,TESTS","Ilmonen, Pauliina@Univ Tampere, Sch Hlth Sci, FI-33014 Tampere, Finland@Aalto Univ, Sch Econ, FI-00076 Aalto, Finland::Oja, Hannu@Univ Tampere, Sch Hlth Sci, FI-33014 Tampere, Finland::Serfling, Robert@Univ Texas Dallas, Dept Math, Richardson, TX 75080 USA","Ilmonen, Pauliina@Aalto University@University of Tampere::Oja, Hannu@University of Tampere::Serfling, Robert@University of Texas System@University of Texas Dallas",not exist,"no title+CARDOSO JF+P IEEE INT C AC SPEE+1989::On affine equivariant multivariate quantiles+Chakraborty, B+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+JUN 2001::On a transformation and re-transformation technique for constructing an affine equivariant multivariate median+Chakraborty, B; Chaudhuri, P+PROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY+AUG 1996::Operating transformation retransformation on spatial median and angle test+Chakraborty, B; Chaudhuri, P; Oja, H+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 1998::no title+CHAUDHURI P+J AM STAT ASSOC+1993::no title+Cichocki,, A.; Amari,, S.-I.+Adaptive blind signal and image processing+2006::ASYMPTOTIC-BEHAVIOR OF S-ESTIMATES OF MULTIVARIATE LOCATION PARAMETERS AND DISPERSION MATRICES+DAVIES, PL+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+SEP 1987::no title+Eaton, ML.+Group Invariance Applications in Statistics+1989::Asymptotic distributions of robust shape matrices and scales+Frahm, Gabriel+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+AUG 2009::A practical affine equivariant multivariate median+Hettmansperger, TP; Randles, RH+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 2002::no title+Horn, RA; Johnson, CR.+Matrix Analysis+1985::no title+HYVARINEN, A; KARHUNEN, J; OJA, E.+Independent Component Analysis+2001::Characteristics of multivariate distributions and the invariant coordinate system+Ilmonen, Pauliina; Nevalainen, Jaakko; Oja, Hannu+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+DEC 1 2010::Tests of multinormality based on location vectors and scatter matrices+Kankainen, Annaliisa; Taskinen, Sara; Oja, Hannu+STATISTICAL METHODS AND APPLICATIONS+2007::Constrained M-estimation for multivariate location and scatter+Kent, JT; Tyler, DE+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 1996::no title+Lehmann, E.

A simulation study is carried out to investigate the performance of the new estimator and its variance estimator, in terms of relative bias, efficiency, and confidence interval coverage rate.

On the Generalized Bootstrap for Sample Surveys with Special Attention to Poisson Sampling,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2011.00166.x,APR 2012,23,10,"We study the generalized bootstrap technique under general sampling designs. We focus mainly on bootstrap variance estimation but we also investigate the empirical properties of bootstrap confidence intervals obtained using the percentile method. Generalized bootstrap consists of randomly generating bootstrap weights so that the first two (or more) design moments of the sampling error are tracked by the corresponding bootstrap moments. Most bootstrap methods in the literature can be viewed as special cases. We discuss issues such as the choice of the distribution used to generate bootstrapweights, the choice of the number of bootstrap replicates, and the potential occurrence of negative bootstrap weights. We first describe the generalized bootstrap for the linear Horvitz-Thompson estimator and then consider non-linear estimators such as those defined through estimating equations. We also develop two ways of bootstrapping the generalized regression estimator of a population total. We study in greater depth the case of Poisson sampling, which is often used to select samples in Price Index surveys conducted by national statistical agencies around the world. For Poisson sampling, we consider a pseudo-population approach and show that the resulting bootstrap weights capture the first three design moments of the sampling error. A simulation study and an example with real survey data are used to illustrate the theory.","Bootstrap weight,estimating equation,generalized regression estimator,pseudo-population,variance estimation,weighted bootstrap","FINITE POPULATION,VARIANCE,ESTIMATORS,JACKKNIFE,DESIGNS","Beaumont, Jean-Francois@STAT Canada, Stat Res & Innovat Div, Ottawa, ON K1A 0T6, Canada::Patak, Zdenek@STAT Canada, Business Survey Methods Div, Ottawa, ON K1A 0T6, Canada","Beaumont, Jean-Francois@Statistics Canada::Patak, Zdenek@Statistics Canada",not exist,"A Direct Bootstrap Method for Complex Sampling Designs From a Finite Population+Antal, Erika; Tille, Yves+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2011::no title+Barbe, P.; Bertail, P.+The Weighted Bootstrap+1995::Generalized bootstrap for prices surveys+Beaumont, J. -F.; Patak, Z.+P 57 SESS INT STAT I+2009::A jackknife variance estimator for unequal probability sampling+Berger, YG; Skinner, CJ+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2005::no title+BERTAIL P+ANN EC STAT+1997::ON THE VARIANCES OF ASYMPTOTICALLY NORMAL ESTIMATORS FROM COMPLEX SURVEYS+BINDER, DA+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+1983::no title+Chauvet, G.+Methodes de bootstrap en population finie+2007::Efficient bootstrap for business surveys+Chipperfield, James; Preston, John+SURVEY METHODOLOGY+DEC 2007::Applying the Horvitz-Thompson criterion in complex designs: A computer-intensive perspective for estimating inclusion probabilities+Fattorini, Lorenzo+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 2006::Theory and application of replicate weighting for variance calculations+Fay, RE.+P SECT SURV RES METH+1989::Median Estimation in Sample Surveys+Gross, S.

Subsampling Inference with K Populations and a Non-standard Behrens-Fisher Problem,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2012.00177.x,APR 2012,57,2,"We revisit the methodology and historical development of subsampling, and then explore in detail its use in hypothesis testing, an area which has received surprisingly modest attention. In particular, the general set-up of a possibly high-dimensional parameter with data from K populations is explored. The role of centring the subsampling distribution is highlighted, and it is shown that hypothesis testing with a data-centred subsampling distribution is more powerful. In addition we demonstrate subsampling's ability to handle a non-standard Behrens-Fisher problem, i.e., a comparison of the means of two or more populations which may possess not only different and possibly infinite variances, but may also possess different distributions. However, our formulation is general, permitting even functional data and/or statistics.

Tracking Progress Towards Statistical Capacity Building Efforts: The African Statistical Development Index,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2011.00151.x,DEC 2011,20,2,"This paper presents the development of the African Statistical Development Index, a composite index that aims at supporting the monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the Reference Regional Strategic Framework for Statistical Capacity Building in Africa. It also helps to identify, for each African country, weaknesses and strengths of the National Statistical Systems so that support interventions can be developed. The paper first gives the rationale behind the development of the index as well as the context. It then elaborates on the methodology used to develop the index, including the selection of components and variables, the scaling of the variables, the weighting and aggregation schemes, and the validation process. The methodology is applied to a sample of African countries. Finally, the paper compares the proposed index to existing statistical capacity building indicators and highlights the related limitations.","Composite index,statistical capacity building,statistical development,national statistical system",,"Sanga, Dimitri@United Nations Econ Commiss Africa, African Ctr Stat, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia::Dosso, Bakary@United Nations Dev Programme Country Off, Libreville, Gabon::Gui-Diby, Steve@United Nations Econ Commiss Africa, African Ctr Stat, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia","Sanga, Dimitri@Unknow::Dosso, Bakary@Unknow::Gui-Diby, Steve@Unknow","GUI-DIBY, Steve Loris@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8548-2077","Towards Reforming National Statistical Agencies and Systems-A Survey of Best-Practice Countries with Effective National Statistical Systems in Africa+no author+Annual Position Paper of STATNET+2007::MEASUREMENT OF INSTITUTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF NATIONS - METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS+ADELMAN, I; MORRIS, CT+JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES+1972::The Reference Regional Strategic Framework for statistical Capacity Building in Africa: Better Statistics for Improved Development Outcomes+no author+UNECA Documents Publishing and Distribution Unit+2006::no title+Babbie, E.+Practice of social research+1995::An overview and evaluation of composite indices of development+Booysen, F+SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH+AUG 2002::Contribution a l'elaboration d'un indice de developpement statistique africain+Diallo, M.S.D.+Memoire redige a l'issue d'un stage effectue a la CEA pour l'obtention du diplome d'Ingenieur Statisticien E conomiste+2007::SOCIAL INDICATORS AND WELFARE MEASUREMENT - REMARKS ON METHODOLOGY+DREWNOWSKI, J+JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES+1972::Proposition pour l'elaboration d'un indice de development statistique des pays africains+Gohia, G.J.A.+Memoire redige a l'issue d'un stage effectue a la CEA pour l'obtention du diplome d'Ingenieur Statisticien Economiste+2006::no title+Gwartney, J.; Lawson, R.; Block, W.+Economic freedom of the world+1996::Measurement of Development: Research at the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development+McGranahan, D.+Internat Social Sci.

Properties of Census Dual System Population Size Estimators,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2011.00150.x,DEC 2011,39,1,"We study parametric and non-parametric approaches for assessing the accuracy and coverage of a population census based on dual system surveys. The two parametric approaches being considered are post-stratification and logistic regression, which have been or will be implemented for the US Census dual system surveys. We show that the parametric model-based approaches are generally biased unless the model is correctly specified. We then study a local post-stratification approach based on a non-parametric kernel estimate of the Census enumeration functions. We illustrate that the non-parametric approach avoids the risk of model mis-specification and is consistent under relatively weak conditions. The performances of these estimators are evaluated numerically via simulation studies and an empirical analysis based on the 2000 US Census post-enumeration survey data.","Capture-recapture,discrete covariate,erroneous enumeration,kernel smoothing,model bias,population size estimation","POST-ENUMERATION SURVEY,RECAPTURE,MODELS,UNDERCOUNT,REGRESSION,CAPTURE,SAMPLE","Chen, Song Xi@Iowa State Univ, Dept Stat, Ames, IA 50011 USA@Peking Univ, Guanghua Sch Management, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China@Peking Univ, Ctr Stat Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China::Tang, Cheng Yong@Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Stat & Appl Probabil, Singapore 117548, Singapore","Chen, Song Xi@Iowa State University@Peking University::Tang, Cheng Yong@National University of Singapore","Chen, Song Xi@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2338-0873","2011 UK census coverage assessment and adjustment strategy+Abbott, O.+Pop.

Towards Unrestricted Public Use Business Microdata: The Synthetic Longitudinal Business Database,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2011.00153.x,DEC 2011,27,23,"In most countries, national statistical agencies do not release establishment-level business microdata, because doing so represents too large a risk to establishments' confidentiality. One approach with the potential for overcoming these risks is to release synthetic data; that is, the released establishment data are simulated fromstatistical models designed to mimic the distributions of the underlying real microdata. In this article, we describe an application of this strategy to create a public use file for the Longitudinal Business Database, an annual economic census of establishments in the United States comprising more than 20 million records dating back to 1976. The U. S. Bureau of the Census and the Internal Revenue Service recently approved the release of these synthetic microdata for public use, making the synthetic Longitudinal Business Database the first-ever business microdata set publicly released in the United States.

We focus on distinguishing situations in which adjustment will reduce, increase, or leave unchanged the degree of bias in an association that is taken to represent a causal effect of one variable on the other. We then consider situations in which adjustment may partially remove or introduce a bias in estimating causal effects, and some additional special cases useful for case-control studies, cohort studies with loss, and trials with non-compliance (non-adherence).","Bias,causality,causal models,collapsibility,compliance,confounding,graphical models,instrumental variables,mediation analysis,odds ratio","MULTIDIMENSIONAL CONTINGENCY-TABLES,MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS,DIRECTED ACYCLIC GRAPHS,PROPENSITY SCORE MODELS,CAUSAL INFERENCE,REGRESSION-COEFFICIENTS,EXPERT-SYSTEMS,COLLAPSIBILITY,BIAS,MISCLASSIFICATION","Greenland, Sander@Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Epidemiol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA@Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Stat, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA::Pearl, Judea@Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Comp Sci, Cognit Syst Lab, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA@Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Stat, Cognit Syst Lab, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Greenland, Sander@University of California System@University of California Los Angeles::Pearl, Judea@University of California System@University of California Los Angeles",not exist,"A comparison of the ability of different propensity score models to balance measured variables between treated and untreated subjects: a Monte Carlo study+Austin, Peter C.; Grootendorst, Paul; Anderson, Geoffrey M.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+FEB 20 2007::no title+BAREINBOIM E+P 2 INT IJCAI WORKSH+2011::no title+BAREINBOIM E+R381 UCLA COGN SYST+2011::Do Instrumental Variables Belong in Propensity Scores ?+Bhattacharya, J.; Vogt, W.

Mixed Hidden Markov Models for Longitudinal Data: An Overview,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2011.00160.x,DEC 2011,118,32,"In this paper we review statistical methods which combine hidden Markov models (HMMs) and random effects models in a longitudinal setting, leading to the class of so-called mixed HMMs. This class of models has several interesting features. It deals with the dependence of a response variable on covariates, serial dependence, and unobserved heterogeneity in an HMM framework. It exploits the properties ofHMMs, such as the relatively simple dependence structure and the efficient computational procedure, and allows one to handle a variety of real-world time-dependent data. We give details of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm for computing the maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters and we illustrate the method with two real applications describing the relationship between patent counts and research and development expenditures, and between stock and market returns via the Capital Asset Pricing Model.","Longitudinal data,mixed hidden Markov model,random effects model,unobserved heterogeneity","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT,GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,EPILEPTIC SEIZURE COUNTS,TIME-SERIES,MIXTURE-MODELS,PROBABILISTIC FUNCTIONS,EM ALGORITHM,PARAMETER-ESTIMATION,ECONOMETRIC-MODELS","Maruotti, Antonello@Univ Roma Tre, Dipartimento Ist Pubbl Econ & Soc, I-00145 Rome, Italy","Maruotti, Antonello@Roma Tre University","MARUOTTI, Antonello@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8377-9950","no title+Agresti, A.+Analysis of Ordinal Categorical Data+2010::R&amp;D spillovers and firms' performance in Italy - Evidence from a flexible production function+Aiello, Francesco; Cardamone, Paola+EMPIRICAL ECONOMICS+2008::A general maximum likelihood analysis of variance components in generalized linear models+Aitkin, M+BIOMETRICS+MAR 1999::A 2-STATE MARKOV MIXTURE MODEL FOR A TIME-SERIES OF EPILEPTIC SEIZURE COUNTS+ALBERT, PS+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1991::Two-part regression models for longitudinal zero-inflated count data+Alfo, Marco; Maruotti, Antonello+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+JUN 2010::Mixed hidden Markov models: An extension of the hidden Markov model to the longitudinal data setting+Altman, Rachel MacKay+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2007::Application of hidden Markov models to multiple sclerosis lesion count data+Altman, RM; Petkau, AJ+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+AUG 15 2005::SUBSPACE ESTIMATION AND PREDICTION METHODS FOR HIDDEN MARKOV MODELS+Andersson, Sofia; Ryden, Tobias+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 2009::no title+Baltagi, H.B.+Econometric Analysis of Panel Data+2001::no title+Barbu, V.; Limnios, N.+Semi-Markov Chains and Hidden Semi-Markov Models Toward Applications: Their Use in Reliability and DNA Analysis+2008::no title+Bartolucci, F.; Farcomeni, A.; Pennoni, F.+An overview of latent Markov models for longitudinal categorical data+2010::A recursive algorithm for Markov random fields+Bartolucci, F; Besag, J+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 2002::A note on the mixture transition distribution and hidden Markov models+Bartolucci, Francesco; Farcomeni, Alessio+JOURNAL OF TIME SERIES ANALYSIS+MAR 2010::A MAXIMIZATION TECHNIQUE OCCURRING IN STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF PROBABILISTIC FUNCTIONS OF MARKOV CHAINS+BAUM, LE; PETRIE, T; SOULES, G; et al.+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1970::STATISTICAL INFERENCE FOR PROBABILISTIC FUNCTIONS OF FINITE STATE MARKOV CHAINS+BAUM, LE; PETRIE, T+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1966::A mutagenetic tree hidden Markov model for longitudinal clonal HIV sequence data+Beerenwinkel, Niko; Drton, Mathias+BIOSTATISTICS+JAN 2007::Using a hidden Markov model to analyse extreme rainfall events in Central-East Sardinia+Betro, Bruno; Bodini, Antonella; Cossu, Q.

Estimation of Common Factors under Cross-Sectional and Temporal Aggregation Constraints,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2011.00152.x,DEC 2011,53,4,"The paper estimates a large-scale mixed-frequency dynamic factor model for the euro area, using monthly series along with gross domestic product (GDP) and its main components, obtained from the quarterly national accounts (NA). The latter define broad measures of real economic activity (such as GDP and its decomposition by expenditure type and by branch of activity) that we are willing to include in the factor model, in order to improve its coverage of the economy and thus the representativeness of the factors. The main problem with their inclusion is not one of model consistency, but rather of data availability and timeliness, as the NA series are quarterly and are available with a large publication lag. Our model is a traditional dynamic factor model formulated at the monthly frequency in terms of the stationary representation of the variables, which however becomes nonlinear when the observational constraints are taken into account. These are of two kinds: nonlinear temporal aggregation constraints, due to the fact that the model is formulated in terms of the unobserved monthly logarithmic changes, but we observe only the sum of the monthly levels within a quarter, and nonlinear cross-sectional constraints, since GDP and its main components are linked by the NA identities, but the series are expressed in chained volumes. The paper provides an exact treatment of the observational constraints and proposes iterative algorithms for estimating the parameters of the factor model and for signal extraction, thereby producing nowcasts of monthly GDP and its main components, as well as measures of their reliability.","Dynamic factor models,EM algorithm,nonlinear state space models,temporal disaggregation,nonlinear smoothing,monthly GDP,chain-linking","DYNAMIC-FACTOR MODEL,ECONOMIC TIME-SERIES,STATE-SPACE MODELS,REAL-TIME,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,BUSINESS CYCLES,EURO AREA,NUMBER,INTERPOLATION,DISAGGREGATION","Proietti, Tommaso@Univ Sydney, Sch Business, Discipline Operat Management & Econometr, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Proietti, Tommaso@University of Sydney",not exist,"NEW EUROCOIN: TRACKING ECONOMIC GROWTH IN REAL TIME+Altissimo, Filippo; Cristadoro, Riccardo; Forni, Mario; et al.+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+NOV 2010::Consistent estimation of the number of dynamic factors in a large N and T panel+Amengual, Dante; Watson, Mark W.+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JAN 2007::no title+Anderson, B.

Connections between Survey Calibration Estimators and Semiparametric Models for Incomplete Data,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2011.00138.x,AUG 2011,50,22,"Survey calibration (or generalized raking) estimators are a standard approach to the use of auxiliary information in survey sampling, improving on the simple Horvitz-Thompson estimator. In this paper we relate the survey calibration estimators to the semiparametric incomplete-data estimators of Robins and coworkers, and to adjustment for baseline variables in a randomized trial. The development based on calibration estimators explains the ""estimated weights"" paradox and provides useful heuristics for constructing practical estimators. We present some examples of using calibration to gain precision without making additional modelling assumptions in a variety of regression models.","Regression,designed-based inference,causal inference","PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODELS,RANDOMIZED CLINICAL-TRIALS,CASE-COHORT,MEASUREMENT-ERROR,STRATIFIED SAMPLES,REGRESSION,EFFICIENCY,PARAMETERS,LIKELIHOOD,INFERENCE","Lumley, Thomas@Univ Washington, Dept Biostat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA@Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Seattle, WA 98104 USA::Shaw, Pamela A.@NIAID, Biostat Res Branch, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA::Dai, James Y.@Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Seattle, WA 98104 USA","Lumley, Thomas@University of Washington@Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center@University of Washington Seattle::Shaw, Pamela A.@NIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID)@National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA::Dai, James Y.@Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center",not exist,"FITTING COX PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODELS FROM SURVEY DATA+BINDER, DA+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1992::ON THE VARIANCES OF ASYMPTOTICALLY NORMAL ESTIMATORS FROM COMPLEX SURVEYS+BINDER, DA+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+1983::URINE NITROGEN AS AN INDEPENDENT VALIDATORY MEASURE OF DIETARY-INTAKE - A STUDY OF NITROGEN-BALANCE IN INDIVIDUALS CONSUMING THEIR NORMAL DIET+BINGHAM, SA; CUMMINGS, JH+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NUTRITION+1985::Exposure stratified case-cohort designs+Borgan, O; Langholz, B; Samuelsen, SO; et al.+LIFETIME DATA ANALYSIS+MAR 2000::Weighted likelihood for semiparametric models and two-phase stratified samples, with application to cox regression+Breslow, Norman E.; Wellner, Jon A.+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+MAR 2007::Improved Horvitz-Thompson Estimation of Model Parameters from Two-phase Stratified Samples: Applications in Epidemiology+Breslow, Norman E.; Lumley, Thomas; Ballantyne, Christie M.; et al.+STATISTICS IN BIOSCIENCES+MAY 2009::A new class of measurement-error models, with applications to dietary data+Carroll, RJ; Freedman, LS; Kipnis, V; et al.+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+SEP 1998::Serniparametric maximum likelihood estimation exploiting gene-environment independence in case-control studies+Chatterjee, N; Carroll, RJ+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 2005::no title+Cochran, WG.+Sampling techniques+1977::GENERALIZED RAKING PROCEDURES IN SURVEY SAMPLING+DEVILLE, JC; SARNDAL, CE; SAUTORY, O+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1993::CALIBRATION ESTIMATORS IN SURVEY SAMPLING+DEVILLE, JC; SARNDAL, CE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1992::Borrowing strength is not the best technique within a wide class of design-consistent domain estimators+Estevao, VM; Sarndal, CE.+&lt;IT&gt;Journal of Official Statistics&lt;/IT&gt;+2004::A paradox concerning nuisance parameters and projected estimating functions+Henmi, M; Eguchi, S+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 2004::Errors-in-covariates effect on estimating functions: Additivity in limit and nonparametric correction+Huang, Yijian; Wang, C.

Three Factors to Signal Non-Response Bias With Applications to Categorical Auxiliary Variables,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2011.00142.x,AUG 2011,25,7,"Non-response causes bias in survey estimates. The unknown bias can be reduced, for example as in this paper by the use of a calibration estimator built on powerful auxiliary information. Still, some bias will always remain. A bias reduction indicator is proposed and expressed as a product of three factors reflecting familiar statistical ideas. These factors provide a useful perspective on the components that constitute non-response bias in estimates. To illustrate the indicator, we focus on the important case with information defined by one or more categorical auxiliary variables, each expressed by two or more properties or traits. Together, the auxiliary variables may represent a large number of traits, more or less important for bias reduction. An examination of the three factors of the bias reduction indicator brings the insight that the ultimate auxiliary vector for calibration need not or should not contain all available traits; some are unimportant or detrimental to bias reduction. The question becomes one of selection of traits, not of complete auxiliary variables. Empirical examples are given, and a stepwise procedure for selecting important traits is proposed.","Calibration,non-response adjustment,non-response bias,auxiliary variables,administrative registers,bias reduction indicator","CALIBRATION,ADJUSTMENT","Sarndal, Carl-Erik@Unknow","Sarndal, Carl-Erik@Unknow",not exist,"On the use of data collection process information for the treatment of unit nonresponse through weight adjustment+Beaumont, J. - F.+Survey Methodology+2005::Propensity to respond and nonresponse bias+Brick, J.

Modelling Time Series of Counts in Epidemiology,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2010.00123.x,APR 2011,27,7,"P>We review generalized dynamic models for time series of count data. Usually temporal counts are modelled as following a Poisson distribution, and a transformation of the mean depends on parameters which evolve smoothly with time. We generalize the usual dynamic Poisson model by considering continuous mixtures of the Poisson distribution. We consider Poisson-gamma and Poisson-log-normal mixture models. These models have a parameter for each time t which captures possible extra-variation present in the data. If the time interval between observations is short, many observed zeros might result. We also propose zero inflated versions of the models mentioned above. In epidemiology, when a count is equal to zero, one does not know if the disease is present or not. Our model has a parameter which provides the probability of presence of the disease given no cases were observed. We rely on the Bayesian paradigm to obtain estimates of the parameters of interest, and discuss numerical methods to obtain samples from the resultant posterior distribution. We fit the proposed models to artificial data sets and also to a weekly time series of registered number of cases of dengue fever in a district of the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, during 2001 and 2002.Resume

Nous passons en revue les modeles dynamiques generalises pour les series temporelles de donnees de comptages. Les donnees de comptages sont generalement modelisees sous la forme d'une loi de Poisson dont la moyenne, ou une de ses transformations, evolue de facon reguliere dans le temps. Nous generalisons cette approche traditionnelle en l'etendant a des melanges de lois de Poisson. Nous considerons en particulier des melanges du type Poisson-gamma et Poisson-lognormal. Ces melanges dependent d'un parametre qui varie selon la date d'observation. Si les intervalles entre les observations sont courts, de nombreuses observations prennent la valeur zero. Nous proposons egalement des versions ""zero inflated"" des modeles decrits plus haut. En epidemiologie, lorsque la valeur zero se presente, il est impossible de savoir si la maladie est presente ou non. Notre modele comporte un parametre qui fournit la probabilite pour que la maladie soit presente conditionnellement a l'absence de cas observes.

Reading Keynes' Treatise on Probability,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2010.00129.x,APR 2011,39,1,"P>A Treatise on Probability was published by John Maynard Keynes in 1921. The Treatise contains a critical assessment of the philosophical foundations of probability and of the statistical methodology at the time. We review the aspects of the book that are most related with statistics, avoiding uninteresting neophyte's forrays into philosophical issues. In particular, we examine the arguments provided by Keynes against the Bayesian approach, as well as the sketchy alternative of a return to Lexis' theory of analogies he proposes. Our conclusion is that the Treatise is a scholarly piece of work looking at past advances rather than producing directions for the future.Resume

Non-Fundamentalness in Structural Econometric Models: A Review,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2011.00131.x,APR 2011,53,19,"P>Current economic theory typically assumes that all the macroeconomic variables belonging to a given economy are driven by a small number of structural shocks. As recently argued, apart from negligible cases, the structural shocks can be recovered if the information set contains current and past values of a large, potentially infinite, set of macroeconomic variables. However, the usual practice of estimating small size causal Vector AutoRegressions can be extremely misleading as in many cases such models could fully recover the structural shocks only if future values of the few variables considered were observable. In other words, the structural shocks may be non-fundamental with respect to the small dimensional vector used in current macroeconomic practice. By reviewing a recent strand of econometric literature, we show that, as a solution, econometricians should enlarge the space of observations, and thus consider models able to handle very large panels of related time series. Among several alternatives, we review dynamic factor models together with their economic interpretation, and we show how non-fundamentalness is non-generic in this framework. Finally, using a factor model, we provide new empirical evidence on the effect of technology shocks on labour productivity and hours worked.Resume

La theorie economique contemporaine fait generalement l'hypothese que l'ensemble des variables macro-economiques, au sein d'une economie, est engendre par un petit nombre de chocs structurels non observables. Un argument recemment avance est que, a l'exception d'un ensemble negligeable de cas (c'est-a-dire, de facon generique), ces chocs structurels peuvent etre recuperes a partir de l'observation du present et du passe d'un nombre eleve, voire d'une infinite, de ces variables macroeconomiques. Cependant, la pratique courante tente de recuperer ces chocs structurels via l'estimation d'autoregressions vectorielles causales (VAR) de petite dimension, ce qui, dans bien des cas, conduit a des resultats incorrects-a moins que le futur de ces autoregressions soit egalement observable, ce qui n'est pas le cas en pratique. En d'autres termes, il se peut que les chocs structurels soient non-fondamentaux par rapport aux vecteurs de dimension finie couramment consideres en macroeconomie. Nous presentons un apercu commente de la litterature econometrique recente dans ce domaine, par lequel nous montrons comment une extension de l'espace des observations permet de resoudre ce probleme, requerant l'analyse, au lieu de VARs de petite dimension, de tres grands panels de series temporelles. Nous mettons l'accent, en particulier, sur les modeles a facteurs dynamiques, que nous passons en revue ainsi que leur interpretation economique, et nous montrons pourquoi la non-fondamentalite, dans ce cadre, est non generique. Pour conclure, nous illustrons le recours aux modeles a facteurs dynamiques en mettant en evidence l'impact des chocs techno-logiques sur la productivite et la duree du travail.","Non-fundamentalness,structural VectorAutoRegressions,dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models,dynamic factor models","APPROXIMATE FACTOR MODELS,DYNAMIC-FACTOR MODEL,SUPPLY DISTURBANCES,AGGREGATE DEMAND,MONETARY-POLICY,BUSINESS-CYCLE,RATIONAL-EXPECTATIONS,NUMBER,SHOCKS,VARS","Alessi, Lucia@European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany::Barigozzi, Matteo@Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Stat, London WC2A 2AE, England@Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, Brussels, Belgium::Capasso, Marco@Maastricht Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Maastricht, Netherlands@Maastricht Univ, UNU MERIT, Maastricht, Netherlands","Alessi, Lucia@European Central Bank::Barigozzi, Matteo@London School Economics & Political Science@Universite Libre de Bruxelles@University of London::Capasso, Marco@Maastricht University",not exist,"Improved penalization for determining the number of factors in approximate factor models+Alessi, Lucia; Barigozzi, Matteo; Capasso, Marco+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+DEC 1 2010::Properties of zero-free transfer function matrices+Anderson, B.D.O.; Deistler, M.+SICE Journal of Control, Measurement, and System Integration+July 2008::Determining the number of factors in approximate factor models+Bai, JS; Ng, S+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 2002::LARGE BAYESIAN VECTOR AUTO REGRESSIONS+Banbura, Marta; Giannone, Domenico; Reichlin, Lucrezia+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+JAN-FEB 2010::Measuring the effects of monetary policy: A factor-augmented vector autoregressive (FAVAR) approach+Bernanke, BS; Boivin, J; Eliasz, P+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+FEB 2005::An empirical characterization of the dynamic effects of changes in government spending and taxes on output+Blanchard, O; Perotti, R+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+NOV 2002::THE DYNAMIC EFFECTS OF AGGREGATE DEMAND AND SUPPLY DISTURBANCES - REPLY+BLANCHARD, OJ; QUAH, D+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+JUN 1993::THE DYNAMIC EFFECTS OF AGGREGATE DEMAND AND SUPPLY DISTURBANCES+BLANCHARD, OJ; QUAH, D+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+SEP 1989::DSGE models in a data-rich environment+Boivin, J.; Giannoni, M.P.+NBER Working Papers 12772+2006::Design Limits and Dynamic Policy Analysis.+Brock, W.; Durlauf, S.; Rondina, G.+NBER Working Papers.

Alternative Approaches to Multilevel Modelling of Survey Non-Contact and Refusal,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2011.00133.x,APR 2011,39,5,"P>We review three alternative approaches to modelling survey non-contact and refusal: multinomial, sequential, and sample selection (bivariate probit) models. We then propose a multilevel extension of the sample selection model to allow for both interviewer effects and dependency between non-contact and refusal rates at the household and interviewer level. All methods are applied and compared in an analysis of household non-response in the United Kingdom, using a data set with unusually rich information on both respondents and non-respondents from six major surveys. After controlling for household characteristics, there is little evidence of residual correlation between the unobserved characteristics affecting non-contact and refusal propensities at either the household or the interviewer level. We also find that the estimated coefficients of the multinomial and sequential models are surprisingly similar, which further investigation via a simulation study suggests is due to non-contact and refusal having largely different predictors.Resume

Nous passons en revue trois approches differentes de la modelisation de l'absence de contact et du refus dans les enquetes: modelisations multinomiale, sequentielle et par selection d'echantillon (probit bivarie). Nous proposons une generalisation de type multi-niveau pour la modelisation par selection d'echantillon afin de prendre en compte les effets lies a l'enqueteur et a la dependance entre les taux d'absence de contact et de refus au niveau des menages et de l'enqueteur. Toutes les methodes sont appliquees et comparees dans le cadre d'une analyse de non-reponse des menages au Royaume-Uni, en utilisant les donnees de six enquetes majeures contenant des informations riches a la fois sur les repondants et les non-repondants. Si l'on tient compte des effets lies aux caracteristiques des menages, nous constatons qu'il subsiste peu d'evidence d'une correlation reelle entres les caracteristiques non observees affectant les probabilites de refus et d'absence de contact, tant au niveau des menage qu'au niveau de l'enqueteur. Nous avons aussi constate que les coefficients estimes pour les modeles multinomiaux et sequentiels sont etonnamment semblables. Apres une analyse par simulations plus detaillees, il semble que ceci soit du au fait qu'il y a tres peu de chevauchements entre les predicteurs d'absence de contact et de refus.","Clustered categorical response data,discrete choice models,hierarchical models,survey non-response,interviewer effects","SAMPLE SELECTION BIAS,HOUSEHOLD SURVEYS,NONRESPONSE,INTERVIEWER,OUTCOMES,PANEL","Steele, Fiona@Univ Bristol, Ctr Multilevel Modelling, Bristol, Avon, England::Durrant, Gabriele B.@Univ Southampton, Southampton Stat Sci Res Inst, Southampton, Hants, England","Steele, Fiona@University of Bristol::Durrant, Gabriele B.@University of Southampton",not exist,"no title+Agresti, A.+An Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis.+1996::no title+BEERTEN R+116 OFF NAT STAT+2004::no title+Ben-Akiva, M; Lerman, S.+Discrete Choice Analysis: Theory and Application to Travel Demand+1985::no title+Bethlehem, J.; Cobben, F.; Schouten, B.+HDB NONRESPONSE HOUS+2011::Assessing the use of sample selection models in the estimation of fertility postponement effects+Billari, F.

Inferential Implications of Over-Parametrization: A Case Study in Incomplete Categorical Data,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2011.00130.x,APR 2011,38,3,"P>In the context of either Bayesian or classical sensitivity analyses of over-parametrized models for incomplete categorical data, it is well known that prior-dependence on posterior inferences of nonidentifiable parameters or that too parsimonious over-parametrized models may lead to erroneous conclusions. Nevertheless, some authors either pay no attention to which parameters are nonidentifiable or do not appropriately account for possible prior-dependence. We review the literature on this topic and consider simple examples to emphasize that in both inferential frameworks, the subjective components can influence results in nontrivial ways, irrespectively of the sample size. Specifically, we show that prior distributions commonly regarded as slightly informative or noninformative may actually be too informative for nonidentifiable parameters, and that the choice of over-parametrized models may drastically impact the results, suggesting that a careful examination of their effects should be considered before drawing conclusions.Resume

Que ce soit dans un cadre Bayesien ou classique, il est bien connu que la surparametrisation, dans les modeles pour donnees categorielles incompletes, peut conduire a des conclusions erronees. Cependant, certains auteurs persistent a negliger les problemes lies a la presence de parametres non identifies.

Simultaneous Parameter Estimation in Exploratory Factor Analysis: An Expository Review,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2010.00120.x,DEC 2010,50,9,"The classical exploratory factor analysis (EFA) finds estimates for the factor loadings matrix and the matrix of unique factor variances which give the best fit to the sample correlation matrix with respect to some goodness-of-fit criterion. Common factor scores can be obtained as a function of these estimates and the data. Alternatively to the classical EFA, the EFA model can be fitted directly to the data which yields factor loadings and common factor scores simultaneously. Recently, new algorithms were introduced for the simultaneous least squares estimation of all EFA model unknowns. The new methods are based on the numerical procedure for singular value decomposition of matrices and work equally well when the number of variables exceeds the number of observations. This paper provides an account that is intended as an expository review of methods for simultaneous parameter estimation in EFA. The methods are illustrated on Harman's five socio-economic variables data and a high-dimensional data set from genome research.","Factor analysis,indeterminacies,least squares estimation,matrix fitting problems,constrained optimization,principal component analysis,rotation","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,ANALYTIC ROTATION,EM ALGORITHM","Unkel, Steffen@Open Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Fac Math Comp & Technol, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England::Trendafilov, Nickolay T.@Open Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Fac Math Comp & Technol, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England","Unkel, Steffen@Open University - UK::Trendafilov, Nickolay T.@Open University - UK","Trendafilov, Nickolay@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9309-1375","Distinct types of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma identified by gene expression profiling+Alizadeh, AA; Eisen, MB; Davis, RE; et al.+NATURE+FEB 3 2000::Statistical inference in factor analysis+Anderson, T.

Estimation of Asymmetric Stochastic Volatility Models: Application to Daily Average Prices of Energy Products,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2010.00125.x,DEC 2010,31,3,"P>Energy supply and demand, and as a consequence energy prices, are likely to represent one of the biggest challenges of the 21st century. Commodity markets exhibit increased volatility when there is little or no underutilized supply capability to meet natural fluctuations in demand. In the case of energy markets, the large capital requirements and significant lead times associated with energy production and delivery make them more susceptible to the imbalances in supply capability and demand. Energy price volatility has destructive impact on market agents, and this impact is intensified when the prices exhibit asymmetric volatility. This article pursues two aspects of the issue. First we consider general aspects, especially the asymmetric pattern of volatility of daily returns of different types of energy products. Then, we analyze the behaviour of daily returns by using traditional models of volatility that include AGARCH, TGARCH, EGARCH, and ARSV strategies, as well as a threshold asymmetric autoregressive stochastic volatility (TA-ARSV) model that we propose. The energy products considered in this analysis are probably the most relevant energy products for the economic activity of the nations and the economic relations between countries: Crude Oil (OPEC reference basket and London Brent index), Gasoline, Natural Gas, Butane, and Propane. We use spot prices and the time reference ranges from 1986-1993 to 2009 depending on the product.Resume

L'offre et la demande de produits energetiques et leur consequence sur le prix de l'energie represente un des plus grands defis du 21eme siecle. La volatilite du marche des matieres premieres s'accroit lors d'une faible utilisation, d'une sous-utilisassions des capacites ou d'un mauvais ajustement aux fluctuations de la demande. Dans le cas du marche des produits energetiques, les besoins en capital et les echeanciers dus a la production et a la livraison les rendent susceptibles d'engendrer des desequilibres dans l'ajustement des quantites d'offre et de demande. La volatilite des prix de l'energie a un impact destructif sur les agents du marche que s'intensifie dans le cas d'une volatilite asymetrique. Cet article poursuit deux objectifs principaux, d'une part analyser les principaux effets mentionnes -specialement ceux lies a une reponse asymetrique de la volatilite- des rendements journaliers des differents types de produits energetiques, et d'autre part faire une analyse de comportement de ces rendements journaliers en utilisant les modeles traditionnels tels que AGARCH, TGARCH, EGARCH et ARSV ainsi que de presenter un modele ARSV asymetrique avec un seuil (TA-ARSV). Les produits energetiques consideres dans cette analyse sont probablement les plus significatifs de l'activite economique des nations et de leurs relations: Le Petrole Brut (Reference panier de l'OPEP et index Brent de Londres), l'Essence, le Gaz Naturel, le Butane et le Propane. Nous utiliserons les prix Spot et les echeanciers de temps compris de 1986-1993 a 2009 compte tenu du type de produit.","Asymmetric stochastic volatility,conditional heteroskedasticity,TA-ARSV model","CARLO MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,CONDITIONAL HETEROSKEDASTICITY,IRREVERSIBILITY,UNCERTAINTY,INVESTMENT,ECONOMICS,OIL","Montero, Jose-Maria@Univ Castile La Mancha, Dept Stat, Ciudad Real, Spain::Fernandez-Aviles, Gema@Univ Castile La Mancha, Dept Stat, Ciudad Real, Spain::Garcia, Maria-Carmen@Univ San Pablo CEU, Dept Quantitat Methods, Madrid, Spain","Montero, Jose-Maria@Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha::Fernandez-Aviles, Gema@Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha::Garcia, Maria-Carmen@San Pablo CEU University","FERNANDEZ-AVILES, 2@S-6003-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5934-1916::MONTERO, JOSE@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1837-8047","IRREVERSIBILITY, UNCERTAINTY, AND CYCLICAL INVESTMENT+BERNANKE, BS+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+1983::GENERALIZED AUTOREGRESSIVE CONDITIONAL HETEROSKEDASTICITY+BOLLERSLEV, T+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+APR 1986::Persistence and kurtosis in GARCH and stochastic volatility models+Carnero, M.

"Memoryless Reigns of the ""Sons of Heaven""",INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2010.00119.x,DEC 2010,25,2,"P>Human lifetimes have increasing failure rates; as people age (beyond early childhood) they are more likely to die. Viewing the succession of Chinese Emperors as a statistical ensemble we show that, unlike lifetimes, their reigns ceased at a constant rate for over two millennia, unaffected by elapsed time. In fact reign lengths of the ""Sons of Heaven"", as the Chinese Emperors were known, followed a memoryless exponential distribution with a 10-year half-life. Becoming emperor not only influenced the duration of remaining life, but length of rule was independent of age at ascent. We propose an explanation for the observed exponentiality using asymptotic results from the theory of stationary stochastic processes.Resume

La duree de vie humaine a un taux de rupture croissant; plus les personnes vieillissent (au dela des morts infantiles) plus leur mort devient probable. En considerant la succession des empereurs Chinois comme un ensemble statistique, nous montrons que, a l'inverse des durees de vie, leurs regnes s'arretaient a un taux constant pendant plus de 2000 ans, sans etre affectes par le temps ecoule. Ainsi, les durees de vie des regnes des 'Fils du Ciel' suivaient une loi exponentielle avec une demi-vie de 10 ans. Devenir empereur n'influencait pas seulement la duree de vie restante, mais la duree de regne etait independante de l'age de l'ascension au pouvoir.

Information Measures in Perspective,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2010.00105.x,DEC 2010,127,30,"P>Information-theoretic methodologies are increasingly being used in various disciplines. Frequently an information measure is adapted for a problem, yet the perspective of information as the unifying notion is overlooked. We set forth this perspective through presenting information-theoretic methodologies for a set of problems in probability and statistics. Our focal measures are Shannon entropy and Kullback-Leibler information. The background topics for these measures include notions of uncertainty and information, their axiomatic foundation, interpretations, properties, and generalizations. Topics with broad methodological applications include discrepancy between distributions, derivation of probability models, dependence between variables, and Bayesian analysis. More specific methodological topics include model selection, limiting distributions, optimal prior distribution and design of experiment, modeling duration variables, order statistics, data disclosure, and relative importance of predictors. Illustrations range from very basic to highly technical ones that draw attention to subtle points.Resume

Les methodologies issues de la Theorie de l'Information sont de plus en plus frequemment appliquees dans des disciplines diverses. Tres souvent, cependant, lorsqu'une mesure d'information est adaptee a un probleme donne, les perspectives unificatrices de la theorie dont elle est issue sont negligees. Nous exposons ici ces perspectives pour un ensemble de problemes rencontres en probabilite et en statistique. L'accent est mis sur l'entropie de Shannon et l'information de Kullback-Leibler. Les notions de base sur lesquelles s'appuient ces deux mesures comprennent les notions d'incertitude et d'information, leurs fondements axiomatiques, leur interpretation, leurs proprietes et leurs generalisations. Les applications visees sont, entre autres, les discordances entre lois de probabilites, la construction de modeles probabilistes, les mesures de dependance entre variables, et l'analyse bayesienne. De facon plus specifique, ces applications se rencontrent en selection de variables, l'etude de lois-limites, la caracterisation de lois a priori et de plans d'experiences optimaux, la modelisation des durees de vie, l'utilisation des statistiques d'ordre, et les performances relatives de predicteurs. Les illustrations vont des problemes les plus simples aux plus techniques, et permettent d'attirer l'attention sur certains points particulierement subtils.","Bayesian information,dynamic information,entropy,Kullback-Leibler information,mutual information","PAST LIFETIME DISTRIBUTIONS,MAXIMUM-ENTROPY,ORDER-STATISTICS,UNIVARIATE DISTRIBUTIONS,AXIOMATIC APPROACH,SHANNON ENTROPIES,PREDICTION FIT,MODELS,INFERENCE,DEPENDENCE","Ebrahimi, Nader@No Illinois Univ, Div Stat, De Kalb, IL 60155 USA::Soofi, Ehsan S.@Univ Wisconsin, Sheldon B Lubar Sch Business, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA::Soyer, Refik@George Washington Univ, Dept Decis Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA","Ebrahimi, Nader@Northern Illinois University::Soofi, Ehsan S.@University of Wisconsin Milwaukee@University of Wisconsin System::Soyer, Refik@George Washington University",not exist,"Maximum entropy utility+Abbas, AE+OPERATIONS RESEARCH+MAR-APR 2006::Information theoretic approach to statistical properties of multivariate Cauchy-Lorentz distributions+Abe, S; Rajagopal, AK+JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND GENERAL+OCT 26 2001::TO SURVIVE OR TO FAIL - THAT IS THE QUESTION+ABEL, PS; SINGPURWALLA, ND+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+FEB 1994::ON COHERENCE IN PARAMETRIC DENSITY-ESTIMATION+AITCHISON, J+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1990::GOODNESS OF PREDICTION FIT+AITCHISON, J+BIOMETRIKA+1975::Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principle+Akaike, H.+2nd International Symposium on Information Theory+1973::Information theoretic framework for process control+Alwan, LC; Ebrahimi, N; Soofi, ES+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH+DEC 16 1998::Measures of information in the predictive distribution+Amaral-Turkman, M.A.; Dunsmore, I.+Bayesian Statistics+1985::no title+Arnold, B.

Selection Bias in Web Surveys,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2010.00112.x,AUG 2010,46,96,"P>At first sight, web surveys seem to be an interesting and attractive means of data collection. They provide simple, cheap, and fast access to a large group of potential respondents. However, web surveys are not without methodological problems. Specific groups in the populations are under-represented because they have less access to Internet. Furthermore, recruitment of respondents is often based on self-selection. Both under-coverage and self-selection may lead to biased estimates. This paper describes these methodological problems. It also explores the effect of various correction techniques (adjustment weighting and use of reference surveys). This all leads to the question whether properly design web surveys can be used for data collection. The paper attempts to answer this question. It concludes that under-coverage problems may solve itself in the future, but that self-selection leads to unreliable survey outcomes.Resume

A premiere vue, les enquetes en ligne semble etre un moyen interessant et attrayant de collecte de donnees. Ils fournissent un acces simple, rapide et peu couteux a un grand groupe de repondants potentiels. Les enquetes en ligne ne sont toutefois pas sans problemes methodologiques. Certains groupes au sein des populations sont sous-representes parce qu'ils ont un acces restreint a Internet. En outre, le recrutement des personnes interrogees est souvent fonde sur l'auto-selection. Sous-couverture et auto-selection peuvent toutes deux etre la source d'estimations biaisees. Le present article decrit ces problemes methodologiques. Il explore egalement l'effet des differentes techniques de correction (ponderation corrective et utilisation d'enquetes de reference). Tout ceci amene a la question de savoir si des enquetes en ligne bien concues sont propres a etre utilisees pour la collecte de donnees. L'article tente de repondre a cette question. Il conclut que le probleme de la sous-couverture pourrait se resoudre dans l'avenir, mais que l'auto-selection aboutit a des resultats d'enquete non fiables.","Adjustment weighting,bias,online survey,reference survey,self-selection,under-coverage,web survey","SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE,PROPENSITY SCORE,STATISTICS","Bethlehem, Jelke@Stat Netherlands, Dept Methodol, The Hague, Netherlands","Bethlehem, Jelke@Unknow",not exist,"no title+Bethlehem, J.+Applied survey methods: A statistical perspective+2009::Reduction of nonresponse bias through regression estimation+Bethlehem, J.

Constrained Kalman Filtering: Additional Results,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2010.00098.x,AUG 2010,46,20,"P>This paper deals with linear state space modelling subject to general linear constraints on the state vector. The discussion concentrates on four topics: the constrained Kalman filtering versus the recursive restricted least squares estimator; a new proof of the constrained Kalman filtering under a conditional expectation framework; linear constraints under a reduced state space modelling; and state vector prediction under linear constraints. The techniques proposed are illustrated in two real problems. The first problem is related to investment analysis under a dynamic factor model, whereas the second is about making constrained predictions within a GDP benchmarking estimation.Resume

La discussion se concentre autour de quatre aspects: le filtrage de Kalman restreint versus l'estimateur de moindres carres restreint recursive; une nouvelle preuve du filtrage de Kalman restreint sous le cadre de l'esperance conditionelle; restrictions lineaires aux modeles espace-etat reduits; et la prediction d'etat sous restrictions lineaires. Les techniques proposees sont illustrees par deux problemes reels. Le premier probleme est concerne par l'analyse d'investissement sous un modele a facteur dynamique, tandis que le second concerne les predictions restreintes dans l'estimation de benchmarking.","Constrained Kalman filtering,linear constraints,state space models","STATE-SPACE MODELS,TIME-VARYING CONSTRAINTS,EQUALITY CONSTRAINTS,LINEAR RESTRICTIONS,STYLE ANALYSIS,SYSTEMS,BENCHMARKING,MANAGEMENT,SERIES,FUNDS","Pizzinga, Adrian@Catholic Univ Rio de Janeiro IAPUC, Financial & Actuarial Risk Management Inst, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil","Pizzinga, Adrian@Unknow",not exist,"no title+Anderson, B.

Anomalies in the Foundations of Ridge Regression: Some Clarifications,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2010.00113.x,AUG 2010,10,3,"Several anomalies in the foundations of ridge regression from the perspective of constrained least-square (LS) problems were pointed out in Jensen & Ramirez. Some of these so-called anomalies, attributed to the non-monotonic behaviour of the norm of unconstrained ridge estimators and the consequent lack of sufficiency of Lagrange's principle, are shown to be incorrect. It is noted in this paper that, for a fixed Y, norms of unconstrained ridge estimators corresponding to the given basis are indeed strictly monotone. Furthermore, the conditions for sufficiency of Lagrange's principle are valid for a suitable range of the constraint parameter. The discrepancy arose in the context of one data set due to confusion between estimates of the parameter vector, beta, corresponding to different parametrization (choice of bases) and/or constraint norms. In order to avoid such confusion, it is suggested that the parameter beta corresponding to each basis be labelled appropriately.Resume","Constrained optimization,constrained least squares,Lagrange's principle,ridge solutions",,"Kapat, Prasenjit@Ohio State Univ, Dept Stat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA::Goel, Prem K.@Ohio State Univ, Dept Stat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Kapat, Prasenjit@Ohio State University::Goel, Prem K.@Ohio State University",not exist,"no title+BALAKRISHNAN AV+SIAM J CONTROL+1963::Constrained estimation and the theorem of Kuhn-Tucker+Davidov, O.+J.

Comparison of Classical and Bayesian Approaches for Intervention Analysis,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2010.00114.x,AUG 2010,52,0,"P>Intervention analysis has been recently the subject of several studies, mainly because real time series present a wide variety of phenomena that are caused by external and/or unexpected events. In this work, transfer functions are used to model different forms of intervention to the mean level of a time series. This is performed in the framework of state-space models. Two canonical forms of intervention are considered: pulse and step functions. Static and dynamic explanation of the intervention effects, normal and non-normal time series, detection of intervention, and study of the effect of outliers are also discussed. The performance of the two approaches is compared in terms of point and interval estimation through Monte Carlo simulation. The methodology was applied to real time series and showed satisfactory results for the intervention models used.Resume

Dans ce travail, les fonctions de transfert sont employees pour modeliser differentes formes d'intervention au niveau moyen d'une serie temporelle. Cette tache est realisee dans le cadre de modeles de etat-espace. Deux formes canoniques d'intervention sont prises en consideration: les fonctions d'impulsion et d'etape. Les modeles consideres tiennent egalement compte de l'explication statique et dynamique des effets d'intervention, series chronologiques normales et non-normales, detection de l'intervention et l'etude des effet des valeurs aberrantes. La comparaison entre les deux approches est effectuee en termes d'estimation ponctuelle et d'intervalle par simulation de Monte Carlo. La methodologie a ete appliquee a series chronologiques reel et a donne des resultats satisfaisants pour les modeles d'intervention utilises.","State space models,dynamic linear models,prediction,transfer function,bootstrap,MCMC","STATE-SPACE MODELS,BOOTSTRAP PREDICTION INTERVALS,GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,TIME-SERIES MODELS,JACKKNIFE,SEQUENCE,POINT","Santos, Thiago R.@Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Stat, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil::Franco, Glaura C.@Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Stat, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil::Gamerman, Dani@Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Stat Methods, BR-21945970 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil","Santos, Thiago R.@Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais::Franco, Glaura C.@Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais::Gamerman, Dani@Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro",not exist,"Transfer functions in dynamic generalized linear models+Alves, Mariane B.; Gamerman, Dani; Ferreira, Marco A.

On Model Selection Curves,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2010.00108.x,AUG 2010,32,12,"P>Many popular methods of model selection involve minimizing a penalized function of the data (such as the maximized log-likelihood or the residual sum of squares) over a set of models. The penalty in the criterion function is controlled by a penalty multiplier lambda which determines the properties of the procedure. In this paper, we first review model selection criteria of the simple form ""Loss + Penalty"" and then propose studying such model selection criteria as functions of the penalty multiplier. This approach can be interpreted as exploring the stability of model selection criteria through what we call model selection curves. It leads to new insights into model selection and new proposals on how to select models. We use the bootstrap to enhance the basic model selection curve and develop convenient numerical and graphical summaries of the results. The methodology is illustrated on two data sets and supported by a small simulation. We show that the new methodology can outperform methods such as AIC and BIC which correspond to single points on a model selection curve.Resume

Beaucoup de methodes populaires de selection de variables impliquent la minimisation d'une fonction penalisee des donnees (comme la vraisemblance maximisee ou la somme residuelle carres) sur un jeu de modeles. La penalite dans la fonction de critere est controlee par un multiplicateur de penalite lambda qui determine les proprietes de la procedure. Nous reconsiderons d'abord des criteres de selection modeles de la forme simple 'Perte + Penalite' et proposons ensuite d'etudier de telles fonctions comme les fonctions du multiplicateur de penalite. Cette approche peut etre interpretee comme l'exploration de la stabilite de fonctions de critere par ce que nous appelons des courbes de choix modeles. Il mene a de nouvelles comprehensions dans le selection de variables et de nouvelles propositions de la facon d'utiliser ces fonctions de critere pour selectionner de variables. Nous utilisons le bootstrap pour augmenter des courbes de choix modele et developpent les resumes numeriques et graphiques des resultats. La methodologie est illustree sur deux jeux de donnees et soutenue par une petite simulation. Nous montrons que la nouvelle methodologie peut surpasser des methodes comme AIC et BIC qui correspond aux points simples sur une courbe de choix modele.","Akaike Information Criterion (AIC),Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC),Generalized Information Criterion (GIC),linear regression,model selection,model selection curves","CROSS-VALIDATION,INFORMATION CRITERION,REGRESSION,CEMENT,NUMBER,CP","Mueller, Samuel@Univ Sydney, Sch Math & Stat F07, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia::Welsh, Alan H.@Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Math & Its Applicat, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia","Mueller, Samuel@University of Sydney::Welsh, Alan H.@Australian National University","Mueller, Samuel@D-4850-2009@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3087-8127","Information Theory and an Extension of the Maximum Likelihood Principle+Akaike, H.+Selected Papers of Hirotugu Akaike+1998::no title+CASELLA G+ARXIV09033620V1+2009::no title+Claeskens, Gerda; Hjort, Nils Lid.+Model Selection and Model Averaging+2008::no title+Flury, B.; Riedwyl, H.+Multivariate Statistics: A Practical Approach+1988::THE RISK INFLATION CRITERION FOR MULTIPLE-REGRESSION+FOSTER, DP; GEORGE, EI+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1994::no title+GUNST GP+REGRESSION ANAL ITS+1980::no title+Hald, A.+Statistical theory with engineering application+1952::DETERMINATION OF THE ORDER OF AN AUTOREGRESSION+HANNAN, EJ; QUINN, BG+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1979::no title+Hastie, T.; Tibshirani, R.; Friedman, J.+The Elements of Statistical Learning+2001::REGRESSION AND TIME-SERIES MODEL SELECTION IN SMALL SAMPLES+HURVICH, CM; TSAI, CL+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1989::Generalised information criteria in model selection+Konishi, S; Kitagawa, G+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1996::ASYMPTOTIC OPTIMALITY FOR CP, CL, CROSS-VALIDATION AND GENERALIZED CROSS-VALIDATION - DISCRETE INDEX SET+LI, KC+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+SEP 1987::SOME COMMENTS ON CP+MALLOWS, CL+TECHNOMETRICS+1973::no title+Miller, Alan J.+Subset Selection in Regression+2002::ROBUST MODEL SELECTION IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MODELS+Mueller, Samuel; Welsh, A.

Bayesian Estimation of Prediction Error and Variable Selection in Linear Regression,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2010.00115.x,AUG 2010,14,0,"P>An important statistical application is the problem of determining an appropriate set of input variables for modelling a response variable. In such an application, candidate models are characterized by which input variables are included in the mean structure. A reasonable approach to gauging the propriety of a candidate model is to define a discrepancy function through the prediction error associated with this model. An optimal set of input variables is then determined by searching for the candidate model that minimizes the prediction error. In this paper, we focus on a Bayesian approach to estimating a discrepancy function based on prediction error in linear regression. It is shown how this approach provides an informative method for quantifying model selection uncertainty.Resume

On Becoming a Statistician-A Qualitative View,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2010.00101.x,AUG 2010,70,6,"P>In this paper, we highlight some qualitative facets of the discipline of statistics and argue that a qualitative approach, in particular a qualitative methodology known as phenomenography, allows us to research important aspects of statistics pedagogy. We summarize several components of our recent research into students' conceptions of statistics, their learning of statistics, our teaching of statistics, and their perceptions of their future professional work. We have obtained this information on the basis of analyses of several series of interviews with students studying statistics, both as statistics majors and as service students. In each of these cases, the broadest views relate in some way to personal connection, growth, and change. In other words, they contain a strong ontological component-focusing on being or becoming a statistician-above and beyond the standard epistemological component-focusing on the knowledge required to do statistics. We discuss the importance of personal change in becoming a statistician, or an informed professional user of statistics, and investigate the pedagogical conditions under which such change is likely to occur.Resume

Nous discutons l'importance du changement personnel pour devenir un statisticien, ou un utilisateur professionnel competent, et etudions les conditions pedagogiques dans lesquelles un tel changement est susceptible de se produire.","Statistics education research,phenomenography,conceptions,professional preparation","STUDENTS LEARN STATISTICS,EDUCATION","Petocz, Peter@Macquarie Univ, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia::Reid, Anna@Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Petocz, Peter@Macquarie University::Reid, Anna@University of Sydney",not exist,"no title+*AM STAT ASS+GUID ASS INSTR STAT+2004::no title+Bailey, N.

Les cours d'initiation a la statistique ont traditionellement vise les consomammateurs de la statistique avec l'intention de produire une population capable de faire une analyse critique des statistiques elementaires publiees. Plus recemment, les professeurs de la statistique ont tente d'orienter les cours d'initiation vers des donnees reelles, afin de motiver les eleves d'un part, et de creer un cours plus pertinent d'autre part. Le succes de cette approche repose sur une provision de donnees que les etudiants considerent comme reels et pertinents. Cependent, les etudiants modernes ont une vision des donnees qui est differente de celle qu'ont eu les eleves d'il y a 10 ou meme 5 ans. Les cours modernes de statistique doivent s'adapter au fait que la premiere rencontre des eleves aux donnees a lieu en dehors de l'academie.Summary

The introductory statistics course has traditionally targeted consumers of statistics with the intent of producing a citizenry capable of a critical analysis of basic published statistics. More recently, statistics educators have attempted to centre the intro course on real data, in part to motivate students and in part to create a more relevant course. The success of this approach is predicated on providing data that the students see as real and relevant. Modern students, however, have a different view of data than did students of 10 or even 5 years ago. Modern statistics courses must adjust to the fact that students' first exposure to data occurs outside the academy.","Education,data technology,statistical literacy,technological literacy,data",EDUCATION,"Gould, Robert@Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Gould, Robert@University of California Los Angeles@University of California System",not exist,"no title+ANDERSON C+WIRED MAGAZINE LIVIN+2009::Data, Data Everywhere: A Special Report on Managing Information+[Anonymous].+The Economist+27 February 2010::no title+Baker, S.+Numerati+2008::no title+BIBBY J+NOTES HIST TEACHING+1986::no title+BIBBY J+STATISTICIAN 4+2003::no title+BROWN EN+AM STAT+2009::Curriculum guidelines for bachelor of science degrees in statistical science+Bryce, GR; Gould, R; Notz, WI; et al.+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+FEB 2001::Stacked Graphs - Geometry &amp; Aesthetics+Byron, Lee; Wattenberg, Martin+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS+NOV-DEC 2008::Reconsidering Statistics Education: A National Science Foundation Conference+Cobb, G.

Assessing the Effect of Data Collection Mode on Measurement,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2010.00102.x,APR 2010,35,40,"P>This paper discusses the challenges in assessing the effects of mixed modes on measurement. We briefly review theories about why different modes of data collection can lead to differences in survey responses and statistical methods typically used to assess mode effects. We then discuss the challenges, including which mode effects are identified, how to test for mode effects, and whether these would affect substantive conclusions. The issues raised are illustrated with examples from the European Social Survey, which is conducting a programme of experimental research to inform decisions about whether to use mixed modes of data collection. The paper concludes with general implications for mixed modes research.Resume

Ensuite nous discutons les defis, y compris quels effets du mode de collecte sur l'erreur mesure sont identifies, comment tester l'effet du mode et si les differences entre modes impactent sur les conclusions de fond. Les considerations sont illustrees avec des examples de l'Enquete Sociale Europeenne ou un programme de recherche est presentement en cours afin d'evaluer la faisabilite d'utiliser plusieurs modes de collecte des donnees.

Calibration Estimation in Survey Sampling,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2010.00099.x,APR 2010,44,23,"Calibration estimation, where the sampling weights are adjusted to make certain estimators match known population totals, is commonly used in survey sampling. The generalized regression estimator is an example of a calibration estimator. Given the functional form of the calibration adjustment term, we establish the asymptotic equivalence between the functional-form calibration estimator and an instrumental variable calibration estimator where the instrumental variable is directly determined from the functional form in the calibration equation. Variance estimation based on linearization is discussed and applied to some recently proposed calibration estimators. The results are extended to the estimator that is a solution to the calibrated estimating equation.

A Review of Hot Deck Imputation for Survey Non-response,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2010.00103.x,APR 2010,95,235,"P>Hot deck imputation is a method for handling missing data in which each missing value is replaced with an observed response from a ""similar"" unit. Despite being used extensively in practice, the theory is not as well developed as that of other imputation methods. We have found that no consensus exists as to the best way to apply the hot deck and obtain inferences from the completed data set. Here we review different forms of the hot deck and existing research on its statistical properties. We describe applications of the hot deck currently in use, including the U.S. Census Bureau's hot deck for the Current Population Survey (CPS). We also provide an extended example of variations of the hot deck applied to the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). Some potential areas for future research are highlighted.Resume

On the Decomposition by Subgroups of the Gini Index and Zenga's Uniformity and Inequality Indexes,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2010.00100.x,APR 2010,25,15,"P>Besides a brief historical outline of the Gini index decomposition proposals, we compare, in a subgroups framework, the decompositions of the Gini index and of the uniformity and inequality indexes recently proposed by Zenga. The two decompositions follow a similar scheme: in both cases the overall index can be at first expressed as a weighted average of convenient ""cross"" measures, with their own interpretation, and afterwards it is decomposed into a within and a between term by merely distinguishing measures evaluated within the same subgroup from the ones regarding different subgroups. This procedure does not depend on an a priori definition of the within or the between term and allows their contribution to be naturally evaluated preserving the structure of the index itself. In the last section the two decompositions are applied to the Italian net household wealth provided by the 2006 central Bank of Italy sample survey on household budgets.Resume

Apres une concise revue de la litterature sur la decomposition de l'indice de concentration de Gini en sous-groupes, cette article confronte les decompositions de la mesure de Gini avec celles d'uniformite et d'inegalite recemment proposees par Zenga. Les deux decompositions suivent un approche similaire: l'indice global d'inegalite s'ecrit sous la forme d'une moyenne ponderee des adequates mesures croises, de facile interpretation. Apres il est decompose en deux composantes: celle entre les groupes et celle dans les groupes, simplement avec la separation des comparaisons a l'interieur de chaque groupe de celles entre les differents groupes. Cette procedure est independant d'une definition a priori des elements entre les groupes et dans les groupes et elle est capable de calculer leurs contributions a l'inegalite totale et de preserver la structure de l'indice. Dans le dernier paragraphe les deux decompositions sont appliquees aux donnees sur la richesse des menages italien recoltees par le sondage de 2006 de la Banque Centrale d'Italie.","Inequality,uniformity,Gini,concentration,subgroups decomposition","INCOME INEQUALITY,DISTRIBUTIONS","Radaelli, Paolo@Univ Milano Bicocca Milan, Dept Quantitat Methods Econ & Business Sci, Milan, Italy","Radaelli, Paolo@University of Milano-Bicocca",not exist,"no title+*BANC IT+STAT B SAMPL SURV S+2008::REGIONAL DISPARITIES IN HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION IN INDIA+BHATTACHARYA, N; MAHALANOBIS, B+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1967::no title+DAGUM C+ASA P BUSINESS EC ST+1997::INEQUALITY MEASURES BETWEEN INCOME DISTRIBUTIONS WITH APPLICATIONS+DAGUM, C+ECONOMETRICA+1980::A New Approach to the Decomposition of the Gini Income Inequality Ratio+Dagum, C.+Empirical Economics+1997::MEASURING THE ECONOMIC AFFLUENCE BETWEEN POPULATIONS OF INCOME RECEIVERS+DAGUM, C+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JAN 1987::Scomposizione ed interpretazione delle misure di diseguaglianza di Gini e di entropia generalizzata+Dagum, C.+Statistica+1997::INEQUALITY DECOMPOSITION ANALYSIS AND THE GINI COEFFICIENT REVISITED+LAMBERT, PJ; ARONSON, JR+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+SEP 1993::no title+MEHRAN F+P 40 SESS INT STAT I+1975::no title+MONTI M+16 U STUD MIL DIP SC+2007::A DECOMPOSITION ANALYSIS OF THE TREND IN UK INCOME INEQUALITY+MOOKHERJEE, D; SHORROCKS, A+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+1982::Extensions of Dagum's Gini decomposition+Mussard, S.; Alperin, P.

Profile Likelihood and Incomplete Data,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2010.00107.x,APR 2010,23,5,"According to the law of likelihood, statistical evidence is represented by likelihood functions and its strength measured by likelihood ratios. This point of view has led to a likelihood paradigm for interpreting statistical evidence, which carefully distinguishes evidence about a parameter from error probabilities and personal belief. Like other paradigms of statistics, the likelihood paradigm faces challenges when data are observed incompletely, due to non-response or censoring, for instance. Standard methods to generate likelihood functions in such circumstances generally require assumptions about the mechanism that governs the incomplete observation of data, assumptions that usually rely on external information and cannot be validated with the observed data. Without reliable external information, the use of untestable assumptions driven by convenience could potentially compromise the interpretability of the resulting likelihood as an objective representation of the observed evidence. This paper proposes a profile likelihood approach for representing and interpreting statistical evidence with incomplete data without imposing untestable assumptions. The proposed approach is based on partial identification and is illustrated with several statistical problems involving missing data or censored data. Numerical examples based on real data are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.","Censoring,evidential analysis,law of likelihood,likelihood paradigm,missing data,partial identification","PARTIALLY IDENTIFIED PARAMETERS,STATISTICAL EVIDENCE,CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS,COMPETING RISKS,TRIALS,MODELS","Zhang, Zhiwei@Eunice Kennedy Shriver Natl Inst Child Hlth & Hum, Biostat & Bioinformat Branch, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Zhang, Zhiwei@National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA@NIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)",not exist,"Asymptotic properties for a class of partially identified models+Beresteanu, Arie; Molinari, Francesca+ECONOMETRICA+JUL 2008::Likelihood methods for measuring statistical evidence+Blume, JD+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+SEP 15 2002::How often likelihood ratios are misleading in sequential trials+Blume, Jeffrey D.+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2008::Statistical evidence for GLM regression parameters: A robust likelihood approach+Blume, Jeffrey D.; Su, Li; Olveda, Remigio M.; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUL 10 2007::TEST STATISTICS AND SAMPLE-SIZE FORMULAS FOR COMPARATIVE BINOMIAL TRIALS WITH NULL HYPOTHESIS OF NONZERO RISK DIFFERENCE OR NON-UNITY RELATIVE RISK+FARRINGTON, CP; MANNING, G+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+DEC 1990::no title+Hacking, I.+The logic of statistical inference+1965::A graphical sensitivity analysis for clinical trials with non-ignorable missing binary outcome+Hollis, S+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+DEC 30 2002::Censoring of outcomes and regressors due to survey nonresponse: Identification and estimation using weights and imputations+Horowitz, JL; Manski, CF+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+MAY 1998::Nonparametric analysis of randomized experiments with missing covariate and outcome data+Horowitz, JL; Manski, CF+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2000::Confidence intervals for partially identified parameters+Imbens, GW; Manski, CF+ECONOMETRICA+NOV 2004::no title+Little, R.J.A.; Rubin, D.B.+Statistical Analysis With Missing Data+2002::no title+Manski,, C.

A General Algorithm for Univariate Stratification,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2009.00093.x,DEC 2009,30,14,"P>This paper presents a general algorithm for constructing strata in a population using X, a univariate stratification variable known for all the units in the population. Stratum h consists of all the units with an X value in the interval [b(h-1), b(h)). The stratum boundaries {b(h)} are obtained by minimizing the anticipated sample size for estimating the population total of a survey variable Y with a given level of precision. The stratification criterion allows the presence of a take-none and of a take-all stratum. The sample is allocated to the strata using a general rule that features proportional allocation, Neyman allocation, and power allocation as special cases. The optimization can take into account a stratum-specific anticipated non-response and a model for the relationship between the stratification variable X and the survey variable Y. A loglinear model with stratum-specific mortality for Y given X is presented in detail. Two numerical algorithms for determining the optimal stratum boundaries, attributable to Sethi and Kozak, are compared in a numerical study. Several examples illustrate the stratified designs that can be constructed with the proposed methodology. All the calculations presented in this paper were carried out with stratification, an R package that will be available on CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network).","Loglinear models,optimal stratification,survey sampling,take-all stratum,take-none stratum","SKEWED POPULATIONS,BUSINESS SURVEYS,OPTIMUM","Baillargeon, Sophie@Univ Laval, Dept Math & Stat, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada::Rivest, Louis-Paul@Univ Laval, Dept Math & Stat, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada","Baillargeon, Sophie@Laval University::Rivest, Louis-Paul@Laval University",not exist,"QUANTIFYING GAINS FROM STRATIFICATION FOR OPTIMUM AND APPROXIMATELY OPTIMUM STRATA USING A BIVARIATE NORMAL MODEL+ANDERSON, DW; KISH, L; CORNELL, RG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1976::Stratification en enquetes entreprises : une revue et quelques avancees+Baillargeon, S.; Rivest, L.-P.; Ferland, M.+P SURV METH SECT STA+2007::POWER ALLOCATIONS - DETERMINING SAMPLE SIZES FOR SUBNATIONAL AREAS+BANKIER, MD+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 1988::no title+BRIGGS J+STAT NZ+2000::Comparison of methods for determining stratum boundaries+Cochran, W.G.+Bulletin of the International Statistical Institute+1961::no title+Cochran, WG.+Sampling techniques+1977::MINIMUM VARIANCE STRATIFICATION+DALENIUS, T; HODGES, JL+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1959::ALLOCATION OF SAMPLE USING VALUES OF AUXILIARY CHARACTERISTIC+DAYAL, S+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+1985::Design issues for the retail trade sample surveys of the U.S. Bureau of the Census+Detlefsen, R.

Penalized Regression with Ordinal Predictors,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2009.00088.x,DEC 2009,31,28,"P>Ordered categorial predictors are a common case in regression modelling. In contrast to the case of ordinal response variables, ordinal predictors have been largely neglected in the literature. In this paper, existing methods are reviewed and the use of penalized regression techniques is proposed. Based on dummy coding two types of penalization are explicitly developed; the first imposes a difference penalty, the second is a ridge type refitting procedure. Also a Bayesian motivation is provided. The concept is generalized to the case of non-normal outcomes within the framework of generalized linear models by applying penalized likelihood estimation. Simulation studies and real world data serve for illustration and to compare the approaches to methods often seen in practice, namely simple linear regression on the group labels and pure dummy coding. Especially the proposed difference penalty turns out to be highly competitive.","Basis function approach,classical linear model,dummy coding,generalized linear models,generalized ridge regression,ordinal predictors,penalized likelihood estimation","RANK ORDER CATEGORIES,RIDGE-REGRESSION,MODELS,ASSIGNMENT,VARIABLES,NUMBERS","Gertheiss, Jan@Univ Munich, D-80799 Munich, Germany::Tutz, Gerhard@Univ Munich, D-80799 Munich, Germany","Gertheiss, Jan@University of Munich::Tutz, Gerhard@University of Munich",not exist,"Sequential ordinal modeling with applications to survival data+Albert, JH; Chib, S+BIOMETRICS+SEP 2001::ORDINAL REGRESSION-MODELS FOR EPIDEMIOLOGIC DATA+ARMSTRONG, BG; SLOAN, M+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+JAN 1989::A BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS FOR A CLASS OF PENALIZED LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATES+BARRY, D+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1995::Boosting with the L-2 loss: Regression and classification+Buhlmann, P; Yu, B+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2003::LOCATION-SCALE CUMULATIVE ODDS MODELS FOR ORDINAL DATA - A GENERALIZED NONLINEAR MODEL APPROACH+COX, C+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUN 15 1995::Flexible smoothing with B-splines and penalties+Eilers, PHC; Marx, BD+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 1996::no title+Fahrmeir, L.; Tutz, G.+Multivariate statistical modelling based on generalized linear models+2001::BOOSTING A WEAK LEARNING ALGORITHM BY MAJORITY+FREUND, Y+INFORMATION AND COMPUTATION+SEP 1995::Experiment With a New Boosting Algorithm+Freund, Y.+P 13 INT C MACH LEAR+1996::no title+Green, DJ; Silverman, BW.+Nonparametric regression and generalized linear models+1994::no title+Hastie, T.; Tibshirani, R.; Friedman, J.+The Elements of Statistical Learning+2001::no title+HOERL AE+TECHNOMETRICS+1970::Smoothing parameter selection in nonparametric regression using an improved Akaike information criterion+Hurvich, CM; Simonoff, JS; Tsai, CL+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1998::Anomalies in the foundations of ridge regression+Jensen, Donald R.; Ramirez, Donald E.+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+APR 2008::ASSIGNMENT OF NUMBERS TO RANK ORDER CATEGORIES+LABOVITZ, S+AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW+1970::Variable fusion: A new Adaptive Signal Regression method+Land, S.R.; Friedman, J.H.+Technical Report 656+1997::no title+LE CS+APPL STAT+1992::The analysis of ordered categorical data: An overview and a survey of recent developments+Liu, I; Agresti, A+TEST+JUN 2005::NOTE ON TREATING ORDINAL DATA AS INTERVAL DATA+MAYER, LS+AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW+1971::ASSIGNMENT OF NUMBERS TO RANK ORDER CATEGORIES - COMMENT+MAYER, LS+AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW+1970::no title+McCullagh, P.; Nelder, J.A.+Generalized Linear Models+1989::REGRESSION-MODELS FOR ORDINAL DATA+MCCULLAGH, P+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1980::The generalized ridge estimator and improved adjustments for regression parameters+Myoken, H.; Uchida, Y.+Metrika+1977::no title+PETERSON B+APPL STAT-J ROY ST C+1990::no title+no author+R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing+2007::THE STRENGTH OF WEAK LEARNABILITY+SCHAPIRE, RE+MACHINE LEARNING+JUN 1990::Sparsity and smoothness via the fused lasso+Tibshirani, R; Saunders, M; Rosset, S; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2005::no title+Tukey, John W.+Explanatory Data Analysis+1977::CODING ORDINAL INDEPENDENT VARIABLES IN MULTIPLE-REGRESSION ANALYSES+WALTER, SD; FEINSTEIN, AR; WELLS, CK+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+FEB 1987::REGRESSION-MODELS WITH ORDINAL VARIABLES+WINSHIP, C; MARE, RD+AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW+1984::no title+Wood, SN.+Generalized additive models: an introduction with R+2006"

The Intra-Cluster Correlation Coefficient in Cluster Randomized Trials: A Review of Definitions,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2009.00092.x,DEC 2009,53,46,"P>The intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of the primary outcome plays a key role in the design and analysis of cluster randomized trials (CRTs), but the precise definition of this parameter is somewhat elusive, especially in the context of non-normally distributed outcomes. In this paper, we provide a unified treatment of ICC as used in CRTs. We present a general definition of the ICC that may be expressed in different ways depending on the modelling approach used to describe the data, illustrating how this general definition is applied to continuous and dichotomous outcomes. Greater complexity arises for dichotomous outcomes; in particular, the usual definition of the ICC cannot be related directly to the parameters of the logistic-normal model that is commonly used for dichotomous outcomes. We show how the definition of the ICC is different when covariates are introduced. Finally, we use our framework and definition of the ICC to draw out implications for those interpreting and choosing values of the ICC when planning CRTs.","Intra-cluster correlation coefficient,cluster randomized trials","INTRACLUSTER CORRELATION-COEFFICIENT,SAMPLE-SIZE,BINARY DATA,PRIMARY-CARE,VARIANCE,MODEL,DESIGN,INTERVENTION,DIARRHEA","Eldridge, Sandra M.@Queen Mary Univ London, Barts & London Sch Med & Dent, London, England::Ukoumunne, Obioha C.@Univ Melbourne, Murdoch Childrens Res Inst, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia@Univ Melbourne, Dept Paediat, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia::Carlin, John B.@Univ Melbourne, Murdoch Childrens Res Inst, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia@Univ Melbourne, Dept Paediat, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia","Eldridge, Sandra M.@Queen Mary University London@University of London::Ukoumunne, Obioha C.@University of Melbourne@Murdoch Children's Research Institute::Carlin, John B.@University of Melbourne@Murdoch Children's Research Institute","Carlin, John@B-3492-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2694-9463","Patterns of intra-cluster correlation from primary care research to inform study design and analysis+Adams, G;

Relative Efficiency of the Fuzzy p-Value Approach to Hypothesis Testing,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2009.00082.x,DEC 2009,14,0,"P>In missing data problems, it is often the case that there is a natural test statistic for testing a statistical hypothesis had all the data been observed. A fuzzy p-value approach to hypothesis testing has recently been proposed which is implemented by imputing the missing values in the ""complete data"" test statistic by values simulated from the conditional null distribution given the observed data. We argue that imputing data in this way will inevitably lead to loss in power. For the case of scalar parameter, we show that the asymptotic efficiency of the score test based on the imputed ""complete data"" relative to the score test based on the observed data is given by the ratio of the observed data information to the complete data information. Three examples involving probit regression, normal random effects model, and unidentified paired data are used for illustration. For testing linkage disequilibrium based on pooled genotype data, simulation results show that the imputed Neyman Pearson and Fisher exact tests are less powerful than a Wald-type test based on the observed data maximum likelihood estimator. In conclusion, we caution against the routine use of the fuzzy p-value approach in latent variable or missing data problems and suggest some viable alternatives.","Complete data,data cloning,imputation,latent variables,locally most powerful test,missing data,Pitman efficiency,randomized test,donnees completes,imputation,variables latentes,test localement le plus puissant,donnees manquantes,efficacite de Pitman,tests randomises","CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,EM ALGORITHM,DATA CLONING,MODELS,DNA","Kuk, Anthony Y.

The Coverage Properties of Confidence Regions After Model Selection,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2009.00089.x,DEC 2009,47,16,"P>It is very common in applied frequentist (""classical"") statistics to carry out a preliminary statistical (i.e. data-based) model selection by, for example, using preliminary hypothesis tests or minimizing AIC. This is usually followed by the inference of interest, using the same data, based on the assumption that the selected model had been given to us a priori. This assumption is false and it can lead to an inaccurate and misleading inference. We consider the important case that the inference of interest is a confidence region. We review the literature that shows that the resulting confidence regions typically have very poor coverage properties. We also briefly review the closely related literature that describes the coverage properties of prediction intervals after preliminary statistical model selection. A possible motivation for preliminary statistical model selection is a wish to utilize uncertain prior information in the inference of interest. We review the literature in which the aim is to utilize uncertain prior information directly in the construction of confidence regions, without requiring the intermediate step of a preliminary statistical model selection. We also point out this aim as a future direction for research.","Confidence interval,prediction interval,preliminary model selection,uncertain prior information","UTILIZING PRIOR INFORMATION,BEHRENS-FISHER PROBLEM,INTERVAL ESTIMATION,VARIABLE SELECTION,PREDICTION ERROR,REGRESSION,PROBABILITY,INFERENCE,VARIANCE,SPECIFICATION","Kabaila, Paul@La Trobe Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Bundoora, Vic 3083, Australia","Kabaila, Paul@La Trobe University",not exist,"CONDITIONAL INTERVAL ESTIMATION OF THE MEAN FOLLOWING REJECTION OF A 2 SIDED TEST+ARABATZIS, AA; GREGOIRE, TG; REYNOLDS, MR+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1989::no title+BERAN R+PROBABILITY BANACH S+1992::PARAMETRIC ROBUSTNESS - SMALL BIASES CAN BE WORTHWHILE+BICKEL, PJ+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1984::THE LITTLE BOOTSTRAP AND OTHER METHODS FOR DIMENSIONALITY SELECTION IN REGRESSION - X-FIXED PREDICTION ERROR+BREIMAN, L+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1992::A comparison of statistical methods for meta-analysis+Brockwell, SE; Gordon, IR+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+MAR 30 2001::INTERVAL ESTIMATION OF ERROR VARIANCE FOLLOWING A PRELIMINARY TEST IN ONE-WAY RANDOM MODEL+CHIOU, P; HAN, CP+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+1995::CONDITIONAL INTERNAL ESTIMATION OF THE EXPONENTIAL LOCATION PARAMETER FOLLOWING REJECTION OF A PRETEST+CHIOU, P; HAN, CP+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1995::Interval estimation of scale parameters following a pre-test for two exponential distributions+Chiou, P+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+FEB 6 1997::IMPROVED CONFIDENCE INTERVALS FOR VARIANCE OF A NORMAL DISTRIBUTION+COHEN, A+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1972::Confidence intervals for the normal mean utilizing prior information+Farchione, David; Kabaila, Paul+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+JUL 15 2008::THE PERFORMANCE OF THE 2-STAGE ANALYSIS OF 2-TREATMENT, 2-PERIOD CROSSOVER TRIALS+FREEMAN, PR+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+DEC 1989::no title+GILES DEA+READINGS ECONOMETRIC+1992::THE EXACT DISTRIBUTION OF A LEAST-SQUARES REGRESSION COEFFICIENT ESTIMATOR AFTER A PRELIMINARY T-TEST+GILES, DEA; SRIVASTAVA, VK+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+JAN 4 1993::no title+GIRI K+THESIS LA TROBE U+2008::The coverage probability of confidence intervals in 2(r) factorial experiments after preliminary hypothesis testing+Giri, Khageswor; Kabaila, Paul+AUSTRALIAN &amp; NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+MAR 2008::IMPROVED INVARIANT CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS FOR A NORMAL VARIANCE+GOUTIS, C; CASELLA, G+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1991::Limiting properties of likelihoods and inference+Hajek,, J.+FDN STAT INFERENCE+1971::THE USE OF PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE IN REACHING STATISTICAL DECISIONS+HODGES, JL; LEHMANN, EL+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1952::THE IMPACT OF MODEL SELECTION ON INFERENCE IN LINEAR-REGRESSION+HURVICH, CM; TSAI, CL+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 1990::On the coverage probability of confidence intervals in regression after variable selection+Kabaila, P+AUSTRALIAN &amp; NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+DEC 2005::Assessment of a preliminary F-test solution to the Behrens-Fisher problem+Kabaila, P+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2005::Valid confidence intervals in regression after variable selection+Kabaila, P+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+AUG 1998::THE EFFECT OF MODEL SELECTION ON CONFIDENCE-REGIONS AND PREDICTION REGIONS+KABAILA, P+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+AUG 1995::On the large-sample minimal coverage probability of confidence intervals after model selection+Kabaila, P; Leeb, H+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2006::UPPER BOUNDS ON THE MINIMUM COVERAGE PROBABILITY OF CONFIDENCE INTERVALS IN REGRESSION AFTER MODEL SELECTION+Kabaila, Paul; Giri, Khageswor+AUSTRALIAN &amp; NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+SEP 2009::CONFIDENCE INTERVALS UTILIZING PRIOR INFORMATION IN THE BEHRENS-FISHER PROBLEM+Kabaila, Paul; Tuck, Jarrod+AUSTRALIAN &amp; NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+DEC 2008::The relative efficiency of prediction intervals+Kabaila, Paul; Syuhada, Khreshna+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2007::Confidence intervals in regression utilizing prior information+Kabaila, Paul; Giri, Khageswor+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+OCT 1 2009::Large-sample confidence intervals for the treatment difference in a two-period crossover trial, utilizing prior information+Kabaila, Paul; Giri, Khageswor+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+MAR 1 2009::Minimax-Bayes compromise estimators+Kempthorne, P.

Three objectives are distinguished, the avoidance of bias, the establishment of a secure base for the estimation of error in traditional designs, and the provision of formally exact tests of significance and confidence limits. The approximate randomization theory associated with analysis of covariance is outlined and conditionality considerations are used to explain the limited role of randomization in experiments with very small numbers of experimental units. The relation between the so-called design-based and model-based analyses is discussed.

He looked at two cases: when the probability of success p = 1/2 and when p is small but n, the number of trials, is large. In the latter case, unlike other problems that he solved in probability, De Moivre never revealed his method of solution. We explore the solution that De Moivre originally suggests and find that his method does not work. We explore other numerical solutions and put forward the suggestion that De Moivre relied on a very cumbersome and tedious method of solution based on his earlier work on series in the 1690s. Since his method was neither quick nor mathematically elegant, he never revealed the method that he used to obtain his numerical solutions.","Fluxional equations,method of false position,roots of series,series inversion",,"Bellhouse, David R.@Univ Western Ontario, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada::Davison, Matt@Univ Western Ontario, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada","Bellhouse, David R.@Western University (University of Western Ontario)::Davison, Matt@Western University (University of Western Ontario)","Davison, Matt@A-9803-2010::Davison, Matt@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7948-4658","Maty's biography of Abraham De Moivre, translated, annotated and augmented+Bellhouse, David R.; Genest, Christian+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+FEB 2007::no title+Bernoulli, J.

Conjoint Measurement with Constraints on Attribute Levels: A Mixture-Amount Model Approach,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2009.00077.x,AUG 2009,30,4,"P>Traditional and choice-based conjoint analyses (CAs) have used full or fractional factorial designs to generate concept profile descriptions. However, these designs confound two factors when costs are associated with attributes: first is the total cost of the concept profile, and second is the allocation of costs among the attributes. Both factors may influence consumers' preferences. So far, these issues have not been separated in the CA literature. The present paper shows how mixture-amount designs used in industrial experiments may be used to separate amount and mixture effects in traditional CA. The extension to choice-based CA using balance incomplete block (BIB) designs is also given.","BIB design,choice sets,conjoint analysis,mixture-amount designs,optimization primary classification: 62K15,secondary classification: 62K10,62K99",CHOICE BEHAVIOR,"Raghavarao, Damaraju@Temple Univ, Dept Stat, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA::Wiley, James B.@Temple Univ, Dept Mkt & Stat, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA","Raghavarao, Damaraju@Temple University@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)::Wiley, James B.@Temple University@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)",not exist,"Stated preference approaches for measuring passive use values: Choice experiments and contingent valuation+Adamowicz, W; Boxall, P; Williams, M; et al.+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS+FEB 1998::no title+BRADLEY MA+TRANSPORT RES REC+1990::An application of economic choice experiments to a traditional land use - deer hunting and landscape change in the Scottish Highlands+Bullock, CH; Elston, DA; Chalmers, NA+JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT+APR 1998::no title+Cornell, J.

Using Multiple Imputation to Integrate and Disseminate Confidential Microdata,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2009.00083.x,AUG 2009,51,15,"P>In data integration contexts, two statistical agencies seek to merge their separate databases into one file. The agencies also may seek to disseminate data to the public based on the integrated file. These goals may be complicated by the agencies' need to protect the confidentiality of database subjects, which could be at risk during the integration or dissemination stage. This article proposes several approaches based on multiple imputation for disclosure limitation, usually called synthetic data, that could be used to facilitate data integration and dissemination while protecting data confidentiality. It reviews existing methods for obtaining inferences from synthetic data and points out where new methods are needed to implement the data integration proposals.","Confidentiality,disclosure,fusion,matching,sharing,synthetic","DISCLOSURE LIMITATION,DISTRIBUTED DATABASES,SECURE,INFERENCES,REGRESSION,SERVERS","Reiter, Jerome P.@Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Reiter, Jerome P.@Duke University",not exist,"Disclosure limitation in longitudinal linked data+Abowd, J.

Its generalisation is also suggested. An important feature, previously not reported, is that the expansion of every cumulant of order >= 2 is made up of separate subseries.

In order to handle certain frequently occurring sums over permutations of members of compound index sets, we introduce a new notation [m](*), where m is a positive integer.","Affine transformation,cumulants,Edgeworth expansion,stochastic Taylor expansion",DISTRIBUTIONS,"Kamanzi-wa-Binyavanga@Walter Sisulu Univ, Dept Stat, Eastern Cape, South Africa",Kamanzi-wa-Binyavanga@Walter Sisulu University,not exist,"Moments and Product Moments of Sampling Distribution+Fisher, R.

Life Expectancies for Small Areas: A Bayesian Random Effects Methodology,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2009.00080.x,AUG 2009,34,5,"P>Monitoring small area contrasts in life expectancy is important for health policy purposes but subject to difficulties under conventional life table analysis. Additionally, the implicit model underlying conventional life table analysis involves a highly parametrized fixed effect approach. An alternative strategy proposed here involves an explicit model based on random effects for both small areas and age groups. The area effects are assumed to be spatially correlated, reflecting unknown mortality risk factors that are themselves typically spatially correlated. Often mortality observations are disaggregated by demographic category as well as by age and area, e.g. by gender or ethnic group, and multivariate area and age random effects will be used to pool over such groups. A case study considers variations in life expectancy in 1 118 small areas (known as wards) in Eastern England over a five-year period 1999-2003. The case study deaths data are classified by gender, age, and area, and a bivariate model for area and age effects is therefore applied. The interrelationship between the random area effects and two major influences on small area life expectancy is demonstrated in the study, these being area socio-economic status (or deprivation) and the location of nursing and residential homes for frail elderly.","Life table,life expectancy,random effects,spatial,small area,Bayesian","MORTALITY,DEPRIVATION,SURVIVAL,RATES,MODEL","Congdon, Peter@Univ London, Dept Geog, London E1 4NS, England","Congdon, Peter@University of London",not exist,"Frailty modeling for spatially correlated survival data, with application to infant mortality in Minnesota+Banerjee, S; Wall, MM; Carlin, BP+BIOSTATISTICS+JAN 2003::no title+BELL F+116 US OFF CHIEF ACT+2005::BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS OF SURVIVAL ON MULTIPLE TIME SCALES+BERZUINI, C; CLAYTON, D+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+APR 30 1994::BAYESIAN IMAGE-RESTORATION, WITH 2 APPLICATIONS IN SPATIAL STATISTICS+BESAG, J; YORK, J; MOLLIE, A+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+MAR 1991::no title+BULUSU L+POPULATION TRENDS+1985::no title+Chiang, CL.+The life table and its applications+1984::no title+*E REG PUBL HLTH O+INPHO 3 LIF EXP E EN+2002::SOCIAL DEPRIVATION AND PREMATURE MORTALITY - REGIONAL COMPARISON ACROSS ENGLAND+EAMES, M; BENSHLOMO, Y; MARMOT, MG+BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL+OCT 30 1993::Evaluation of methodologies for small area life expectancy estimation+Eayres, D; Williams, ES+JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH+MAR 1 2004::Bayesian parsimonious covariance estimation for hierarchical linear mixed models+Fruhwirth-Schnatter, Sylvia; Tuchler, Regina+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+MAR 2008::no title+GAMERMAN D+APPL STAT-J ROY ST C+1991::Model determination using sampling based methods+Gelfand, A.+Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Practice+1996::SAMPLING-BASED APPROACHES TO CALCULATING MARGINAL DENSITIES+GELFAND, AE; SMITH, AFM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1990::STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS OF A MULTIPLICATIVE MODEL AND ITS APPLICATION TO THE STANDARDIZATION OF VITAL-RATES - A REVIEW+HOEM, JM+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+AUG 1987::no title+IBRAHIM JG+BAYESIAN SURVIVAL AN+2001::Discharge rates of Medicare stroke patients to skilled nursing facilities: Bayesian logistic regression with unobserved heterogeneity+Kahn, MJ; Raftery, AE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1996::WinBUGS - A Bayesian modelling framework: Concepts, structure, and extensibility+Lunn, DJ; Thomas, A; Best, N; et al.+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+OCT 2000::On the formation of lactose+Marshall, FHA; Kirkness, JM+BIOCHEMICAL JOURNAL+1907::no title+McCullagh, P.; Nelder, J.A.+Generalized Linear Models+1989::no title+MOLLIE A+MARKOV CHAIN MONTE C+1996::no title+*OFF NAT STAT+LIF EXP BIRT WARDS E+2006::no title+no author+The English Indices of Deprivation 2004: Summary+2005::no title+RICHARDSON S+SPATIAL EPIDEMIOLOGY+2000::ASSESSMENT OF SPATIAL VARIATION OF RISKS IN SMALL POPULATIONS+RIGGAN, WB; MANTON, KG; CREASON, JP; et al.+ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES+DEC 1991::no title+Rue, H.; Held, L.+Gaussian Markov Random Fields: Theory and Applications+2005::Urban-rural mortality differentials: controlling for material deprivation+Senior, M; Williams, H; Higgs, G+SOCIAL SCIENCE &amp; MEDICINE+JUL 2000::Life expectancy as a summary of mortality in a population: statistical considerations and suitability for use by health authorities+Silcocks, PBS; Jenner, DA; Reza, R+JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH+JAN 2001::no title+SONG J+J MULTIVARIATE ANAL+2005::Bayesian measures of model complexity and fit+Spiegelhalter, DJ; Best, NG; Carlin, BR; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2002::Life expectancy at birth: methodological options for small populations.+Toson, B; Baker, A.+National statistics methodological series+2003::ANOTHER SHORTCUT METHOD FOR CALCULATING THE CONFIDENCE-INTERVAL OF A POISSON VARIABLE OR OF A STANDARDIZED MORTALITY RATIO+URY, HK; WIGGINS, AD+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+1985::Clustering, cluster detection and spatial variation in risk+Wakefield, J.; Kelsall, J.; Morris, S.+Spatial Epidemiology.

The more general assumption is equivalent to a model-free randomization-based framework when finite population correction is ignored. Unlike when an Edgeworth expansion is used to construct one-sided intervals under simple random sampling, it is necessary to estimate the variance of the estimator for the population proportion when the stratum means are allowed to differ. As a result, there may be accuracy gains from replacing the normal z-score in the Edgeworth expansion with a t-score.","Edgeworth expansion,effective degrees of freedom,model",CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS,"Kott, Phillip S.@Natl Agr Stat Serv, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA::Liu, Yan K.@Internal Revenue Serv, Washington, DC 20013 USA","Kott, Phillip S.@Unknow::Liu, Yan K.@Unknow",not exist,"Two-sided coverage intervals for small proportion based on survey data+Andersson, P.

"The Rule of Three, its Variants and Extensions",INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2009.00078.x,AUG 2009,23,5,"P>The Rule of Three (R3) states that 3/n is an approximate 95% upper limit for the binomial parameter, when there are no events in n trials. This rule is based on the one-sided Clopper-Pearson exact limit, but it is shown that none of the other popular frequentist methods lead to it. It can be seen as a special case of a Bayesian R3, but it is shown that among common choices for a non-informative prior, only the Bayes-Laplace and Zellner priors conform with it. R3 has also incorrectly been extended to 3 being a ""reasonable"" upper limit for the number of events in a future experiment of the same (large) size, when, instead, it applies to the binomial mean. In Bayesian estimation, such a limit should follow from the posterior predictive distribution. This method seems to give more natural results than-though when based on the Bayes-Laplace prior technically converges with-the method of prediction limits, which indicates between 87.5% and 93.75% confidence for this extended R3. These results shed light on R3 in general, suggest an extended Rule of Four for a number of events, provide a unique comparison of Bayesian and frequentist limits, and support the choice of the Bayes-Laplace prior among non-informative contenders.","Binomial,beta-binomial,Poisson,predictive inference,non-informative priors,zero events","INTERVAL ESTIMATION,BINOMIAL PARAMETER,CONFIDENCE,APPROXIMATE,PRIORS","Tuyl, Frank@Univ Newcastle, ARC Ctr Complex Dynam Syst & Control, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia::Gerlach, Richard@Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia::Mengersen, Kerrie@Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Math Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia","Tuyl, Frank@University of Newcastle::Gerlach, Richard@University of Sydney::Mengersen, Kerrie@Queensland University of Technology (QUT)",not exist,"Approximate is better than ""exact"" for interval estimation of binomial proportions+Agresti, A; Coull, BA+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1998::IMPROVED CONFIDENCE-STATEMENTS FOR THE BINOMIAL PARAMETER+ANGUS, JE; SCHAFER, RE+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+1984::no title+Berger, J.+Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis+1985::no title+BERNARDO JM+BAYESIAN THINKING MO+2005::Interval estimation for a binomial proportion - Comment - Rejoinder+Brown, LD; Cai, TT; DasGupta, A; et al.+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 2001::no title+Carlin, B; Louis, T.+Bayes and empirical Bayes methods for data analysis+1996::Evaluating interval forecasts+Christoffersen, PF+INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC REVIEW+NOV 1998::The use of confidence or fiducial limits illustrated in the case of the binomial.+Clopper, CJ; Pearson, ES+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1934::CAViaR: Conditional autoregressive value at risk by regression quantiles+Engle, RF; Manganelli, S+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+OCT 2004::no title+Geisser, S.+Predictive Inference+1993::no title+Hahn, G.

Karl Pearson and the Establishment of Mathematical Statistics,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2009.00073.x,APR 2009,138,6,"At the end of the nineteenth century, the content and practice of statistics underwent a series of transitions that led to its emergence as a highly specialised mathematical discipline. These intellectual and later institutional changes were, in part, brought about by a mathematical-statistical translation of Charles Darwin's redefinition of the biological species as something that could be viewed in terms of populations. Karl Pearson and W.F.R. Weldon's mathematical reconceptualisation of Darwinian biological variation and ""statistical"" population of species in the 1890s provided the framework within which a major paradigmatic shift occurred in statistical techniques and theory. Weldon's work on the shore crab in Naples and Plymouth from 1892 to 1895 not only brought them into the forefront of ideas of speciation and provided the impetus to Pearson's earliest statistical innovations, but it also led to Pearson shifting his professional interests from having had an established career as a mathematical physicist to developing one as a biometrician. The innovative statistical work Pearson undertook with Weldon in 1892 and later with Francis Galton in 1894 enabled him to lay the foundations of modern mathematical statistics. While Pearson's diverse publications, his establishment of four laboratories and the creation of new academic departments underscore the plurality of his work, the main focus of his life-long career was in the establishment and promulgation of his statistical methodology.","Chi-square,correlation,Darwinism,Karl Pearson,Francis Galton,method of moments,regression,variation,W,F,R,Weldon","ORIGINS,YULE","Magnello, M.

Karl Pearson-The Scientific Life in a Statistical Age by Theodore M. Porter: A Review,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2009.00068.x,APR 2009,39,1,"Porter presents an excellent account of the young Karl Pearson and his extraordinarily varied activities. These ranged from the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos Exams to German history and folklore, and included free thought, socialism, the woman's question, and the law. Returning to science, Pearson produced the famous Grammar of Science. He decided on a career in statistics only at age 35. Porter emphasizes Pearson's often acrimonious but largely successful battles to show the wide applicability and importance of statistics in many areas of science and public affairs. Eugenics became a passion for Pearson. Avoiding all formulas Porter fails to give any concrete ideas of even Pearson's most important contributions to statistical theory.

Karl Pearson and the Origin of Kurtosis,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2009.00076.x,APR 2009,19,10,"Although the kurtosis index proposed by Karl Pearson in 1905 is introduced in statistical textbooks at all levels, the measure is not easily interpreted and has been a subject of considerable debate. In this study, the theoretical development of kurtosis is surveyed from a historical perspective of Pearson's work on evolution. It surprisingly emerges that there was no emphasis in Pearson's papers on kurtosis as measuring (in part) tail heaviness. However, it is found that Pearson used to frequently adjust the formalisation of kurtosis depending on his changing needs. This complex development partly explains the confusion that would surround kurtosis in subsequent literature. Our conclusion is that most misunderstandings arise from improper use of the kurtosis coefficient outside the Pearson system of frequency curves.","Standard fourth moment,Excess,Flat-toppedness,Tailedness,Pearson system","MATHEMATICAL CONTRIBUTIONS,SKEW VARIATION,DISTRIBUTIONS,SUPPLEMENT,EVOLUTION,MEMOIR","Fiori, Anna M.@Univ Milan, Dept Quantitat Methods Econ & Business Sci, I-20126 Milan, Italy::Zenga, Michele@Univ Milan, Dept Quantitat Methods Econ & Business Sci, I-20126 Milan, Italy","Fiori, Anna M.@University of Milan::Zenga, Michele@University of Milan","FIORI, ANNA MARIA@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1914-7777","no title+AITKEN, A.

His interests were wide-ranging and so his impact on statistics in the United States was also wide-ranging. Many American researchers came to University College London to study with him. Others studied his work from afar. In the United States, Pearsonian statistics first penetrated the academic landscape in biology. This was soon followed by the fields of economics and psychology. It was not until relatively late in Pearson's career that several American mathematicians took up statistics as a serious research topic.","Biology,Charles Davenport,economics,eugenics,Helen Walker,Henry Schultz,human intelligence,Karl Holzinger,Henry Moore,mathematical statistics,Raymond Pearl","PROBABILITY INTEGRALS,SAMPLING ERROR,STATISTICS,CHARACTERS,ECONOMICS","Bellhouse, David R.@Univ Western Ontario, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada","Bellhouse, David R.@Western University (University of Western Ontario)",not exist,"Old Wine in New Bottles: From Eugenics to Population Control in the Work of Raymond Pearl+Allen, Garland E.+The Expansion of American Biology+1991::no title+*AN MARQ CO+WHOS WHO AM BIOGR DI+no time::Galton's law of ancestral heredity+Bulmer, M+HEREDITY+NOV 1998::Probability integrals for a hypergeometric series.+Camp, BA+BIOMETRIKA+1925::On a short method of least squares.+Camp, BH+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICS+1923::Probability integrals for the point binomial.+Camp, BH+BIOMETRIKA+1924::Problems in sampling+Camp, BH+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1923::no title+COX DR+BERNOULLI NEWS+2001::no title+CRATHORNE AR+ANN MATH STAT+1944::James Arthur Harris [1880-1930]+DAVENPORT, C.

Understanding Karl Pearson's Influence on Italian Statistics in the Early 20th Century,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2009.00070.x,APR 2009,46,3,"Karl Pearson's work strongly influenced the development of Italian statistics in the early 20th century. This paper reports some Italian contributions following Pearson's thought, which are probably less known outside Italy; for other Italian work, which was more successful internationally, just a brief description is given. Pearsonian topics are divided into three categories: curve systems, interpolation and correlation. For the first category, the contribution by F. De Helguero and F. Insolera is outlined. The former worked on dimorphic curves and developed a new family as a modification of the normal model; the latter dealt primarily with the problems arising when Pearson's curve system is applied to data that do not meet its basic assumptions. For interpolation, we recall a remarkable work by C. Gini, where Pearson's idea of minimizing geometrical distances of points from an interpolating line is discussed and extended. Contributions by G. Pietra and G. Bortolotti are discussed. Regarding correlation, where the Italian contribution was large, the paper focuses on the work by C.E. Bonferroni and G. Parenti, who extended Pearson's product-moment correlation r and Pearson's correlation ratio eta to the general case of polynomial dependence. A discussion on the correct interpretation of eta by Parenti is reported.","Bonferroni,de Finetti,De Helguero,dimorphic curves,Gini,Insolera,least-squares method,Parenti,Pearson's curve system,Pearson's correlation ratio,Pearson's product-moment correlation",,"Borroni, Claudio Giovanni@Univ Studi Milano Bicocca, Dipartimento Metodi Quantitat Sci Econ & Aziendal, Milan, Italy","Borroni, Claudio Giovanni@University of Milano-Bicocca","BORRONI, CLAUDIO GIOVANNI@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1251-9988","A CLASS OF DISTRIBUTIONS WHICH INCLUDES THE NORMAL ONES+AZZALINI, A+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+1985::no title+BONFERRONI CE+ELEMENTI STAT GEN+1933::no title+BONFERRONI CE+GIORN DEGLI EC+1939::no title+BONFERRONI CE+GIORNALE EC ANN EC+1942::no title+BONFERRONI CE+GIORNALE EC ANN EC+1942::no title+BORTOLOTTI G+STATISTICA+1945::no title+CANTELLI FP+SULL ADATTAMENTO CUR+1905::De Finetti's contribution to probability and statistics+Cifarelli, DM; Regazzini, E+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+NOV 1996::A proposito di correlazione.+DE FINETTI, B.+Supplement Statistic Ai Nuovi Problemi di Politica, Storia ed Economia+1937::Variations and omissions of flouroescence studies of Cichorium intybus L.+De Helguero, F+BIOMETRIKA+OCT-JUN 1906::On the maximum of the dimorphic curve+De Helguero, F+BIOMETRIKA+JAN-DEC 1904::Sulla rappresentazione analitica delle curve statistiche+de Helguero, F.+Giornale degli Economisti+1909::no title+DEHELGUERO F+BIOMETRIKA+1905::Karl Pearson and the Origin of Kurtosis+Fiori, Anna M.; Zenga, Michele+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+APR 2009::Sur le coefficient, dit de correlation et sur la correlation en general+Frechet, M.+Revue de l'Institut International de Statistique+1934::Di una misura della dissomiglianza tra due gruppi di quantita e delle sue applicazioni allo studio delle relazioni statistiche+Gini, C.+Atti del R.

His motivation was the 1895 paper of Pearson on skew frequency curves. Kapteyn had concluded that the theory was open to grave objections and was not adapted to nonmathematical readers. He was then led to an independent investigation of the subject. This publication would lead to a heated dialogue between Kapteyn and Pearson, in which they accused each other of inappropriate starting points, of plagiarism and of making serious mathematical mistakes. This article evaluates these claims.

Karl Pearson in Russian Contexts,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2009.00071.x,APR 2009,120,7,"The confluence of statistics and probability into mathematical statistics in the Russian Empire through the interaction, 1910-1917, of A.A. Chuprov and A.A. Markov was influenced by the writings of the English Biometric School, especially those of Karl Pearson. The appearance of the Russian-language exposition of Pearsonian ideas by E. E. Slutsky in 1912 was instrumental in this confluence. Slutsky's predecessors in such writings (Lakhtin, Orzhentskii, and Leontovich) were variously of mathematical, political economy, and biological backgrounds. Work emanating from the interpolational nature of Pearson's system of frequency curves was continued subsequently through the work of Markov, Bernstein, Romanovsky, and Kravchuk (Krawtchouk), who laid a solid probabilistic foundation. The correlational nature in the interpolational early work of Chebyshev, and work of the English Biometric School in the guise of linear least-squares fitting exposited as the main component of Slutsky's book, was developed in population as well as sample context by Chuprov. He also championed the expectation operation in providing exact relations between sample and population moments, in direct interaction with Karl Pearson. Romanovsky emerges as the most adaptive and modern mathematical statistician.","English Biometric School,interpolation,linear least squares,orthogonal polynomial expansions,Pearson's system of curves,skewness,Scandinavian Statistical School,Karl Pearson,Chebyshev,Markov,Chuprov,Slutsky,Bernstein,Romanovsky,Krawtchouk,Isserlis,Orzhentskii,Lakhtin,Mitropolskii","SMALL NUMBERS,SMALL SAMPLES,LAW,MOMENTS,CHUPROV,HISTORY,CURVES,SERIES","Seneta, Eugene@Univ Sydney, Sch Math & Stat, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Seneta, Eugene@University of Sydney",not exist,"Probability dispersion curves, what are the yield limits of Pearson dispersion curves?+Ambarzumian, G+COMPTES RENDUS DE L ACADEMIE DES SCIENCES DE L URSS+1937::Again on ""The elimination of spurious correlation due to position in time or space""+Anderson, O+BIOMETRIKA+APR-MAY 1914::On the Gram Series on Pearson's System of Frequency Functions+Andersson, W.+SKANDINAVISK AKTUARIETIDSKRIFT+1942::Karl Pearson's Influence in the United States+Bellhouse, David R.+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+APR 2009::On the curves of probabilities distribution.+Bernstein, S.+MATHEMATISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT+1926::On the Fisher 'confidence' probabilities+Bernstein, S.

The interrelationship among these indices has been highlighted. Attention has been drawn to their drawbacks. The relation of these indices to the proportion nonconforming has been dwelt upon and the requirement of the adequate sample size has been emphasized. Cautionary remarks on the use of these indices in the case of nonnormal distributions, skewed distributions, and autocorrelated data are also presented. The effect of measurement error on process capability indices has been dealt with in great detail.","Autocorrelation,measurement error,nonnormality,sample size,skewed distributions","STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,MEASUREMENT ERRORS,NONNORMAL DATA,C-PM,TOOL,QUALITY,CPK,LIMITS","Anis, Mohammed Z.@Indian Stat Inst, SQC & OR Unit, Kolkata, India","Anis, Mohammed Z.@Indian Statistical Institute@Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata",not exist,"no title+BARNETT NS+INT J QUALITY RELIAB+1990::Statistical analysis of process capability indices with measurement errors+Bordignon, S; Scagliarini, M+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+JUL-AUG 2002::Estimation of C-pm when measurement error is present+Bordignon, Silvano; Scagliarini, Michele+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+NOV 2006::no title+BOTHE D+MEASURING PROCESS CA+2001::Assessing capability for hole location+Bothe, D.R.+Quality Engineering+July-Sept. 2006::Process capability indices - A review, 1992-2000 - Discussion+Bothe, DR+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2002::THE TAGUCHI CAPABILITY INDEX+BOYLES, RA+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 1991::Capability index for relational functions: inferential procedures+Bulba, E.A.; Ho, L.L.+Quality Engineering+Jan.-March 2006::A NEW MEASURE OF PROCESS CAPABILITY - CPM+CHAN, LK; CHENG, SW; SPIRING, FA+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1988::Process capability indices for skewed populations+Chang, YS; Choi, IS; Bai, DS+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+SEP-OCT 2002::no title+CHARBONNEAU HC+IND QUALITY CONTROL+1978::THE ASYMPTOTIC-DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROCESS CAPABILITY INDEX C-PMK+CHEN, SM; HSU, NF+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1995::Selecting a better supplier by testing process capability indices+Chou, Y.

Sampling Procedures for Coordinating Stratified Samples: Methods Based on Microstrata,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2008.00057.x,DEC 2008,19,3,"The aim of sampling coordination is to maximize or minimize the overlap between several samples drawn successively in a population that changes over time. Therefore, the selection of a new sample will depend on the samples previously drawn. In order to obtain a larger (or smaller) overlap of the samples than the one obtained by independent selection of samples, a dependence between the samples must be introduced. This dependence will emphasize (or limit) the number of common units in the selected samples. Several methods for coordinating stratified samples, such as the Kish & Scott method, the Cotton & Hesse method, and the Riviere method, have already been developed. Using simulations, we compare the optimality of these methods and their quality of coordination. We present six new methods based on permanent random numbers (PRNs) and microstrata. These new methods have the advantage of allowing us to choose between positive or negative coordination with each of the previous samples. Simulations are run to test the validity of each of them.","Sample coordination,stratified samples,permanent random numbers,microstrata",,"Nedyalkova, Desislava@Univ Neuchatel, Inst Stat, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland::Pea, Johan@Swiss Fed Stat Off, CH-2010 Neuchatel, Switzerland::Tille, Yves@Univ Neuchatel, Inst Stat, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland","Nedyalkova, Desislava@University of Neuchatel::Pea, Johan@Unknow::Tille, Yves@University of Neuchatel","Tille, Yves@H-9676-2016@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0904-5523","no title+BLEUER SR+20020726 STAT CAN+2002::Selecting several samples from a single population+Brewer, K.R.W; Early, L.J; Joyce, S.F.+Australian Journal of Statistics+1972::no title+COTTON F+E9206 INSEE+1992::A system of co- ordinated sampling to spread response burden of enterprises+DeRee, S.

Optimal Design Approach to GMM Estimation of Parameters Based on Empirical Transforms,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2008.00055.x,DEC 2008,29,4,"Parameter estimation based on the generalized method of moments (GMM) is proposed. The proposed method employs a distance between an empirical and the corresponding theoretical transform. Estimation by the empirical characteristic function (CF) is a typical example, but alternative empirical transforms are also employed, such as the empirical Laplace transform when dealing with non-negative random variables. D-optimal designs are discussed, whereby the arguments of the empirical transform are chosen by maximizing the determinant of the asymptotic Fisher information matrix for the resulting estimators. The methods are applied to some parametric models for which classical inference is complicated.","Empirical characteristic function,empirical Laplace transform,parameter estimation,normal inverse Gaussian model,normal variance Gamma model","CUMULANT GENERATING FUNCTION,SWITCHING REGRESSIONS,NORMAL-DISTRIBUTIONS,MODELS,VOLATILITY,EFFICIENCY,MIXTURES,RETURNS","Braun, Maria P.@St Petersburg State Univ, Fac Math & Mech, St Petersburg 198504, Russia::Meintanis, Simos G.@Univ Athens, Dept Econ, Athens 10559, Greece::Melas, Viatcheslav B.@St Petersburg State Univ, Fac Math & Mech, St Petersburg 198504, Russia","Braun, Maria P.@Saint Petersburg State University::Meintanis, Simos G.@University of Athens::Melas, Viatcheslav B.@Saint Petersburg State University","Melas, Viatcheslav@J-7007-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8343-1006","no title+Adler, R.

Regression Revisited,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2008.00053.x,DEC 2008,36,8,"Sir Francis Galton introduced median regression and the use of the quantile function to describe distributions. Very early on the tradition moved to mean regression and the universal use of the Normal distribution, either as the natural 'error' distribution or as one forced by transformation. Though the introduction of 'quantile regression' refocused attention on the shape of the variability about the line, it uses nonparametric approaches and so ignores the actual distribution of the 'error' term. This paper seeks to show how Galton's approach enables the complete regression model, deterministic and stochastic elements, to be modelled, fitted and investigated. The emphasis is on the range of models that can be used for the stochastic element. It is noted that as the deterministic terms can be built up from components, so to, using quantile functions, can the stochastic element. The model may thus be treated in both modelling and fitting as a unity. Some evidence is presented to justify the use of a much wider range of distributional models than is usually considered and to emphasize their flexibility in extending regression models.","Regression,quantile function,quantile regression,parametric models,Sir Francis Galton",,"Gilchrist, Warren@Sheffield Hallam Univ, Sheffield S10 3RP, S Yorkshire, England","Gilchrist, Warren@Sheffield Hallam University",not exist,"Further results on a class of distributions which includes the normal ones+Azzalini, A.+Statistica+1986::no title+Berk, K.; Carey, P.+Data Analysis with Microsoft Excel+2000::no title+BOX GEP+TIME SERIES ANAL+1970::no title+Carroll, R; Ruppert, D.+Transformation and weighting in regression+1988::no title+DANIEL C+FITTING EQUATIONS DA+1980::no title+David, H.

On Average Predictive Comparisons and Interactions,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2008.00056.x,DEC 2008,15,9,"In a regression context, consider the difference in expected outcome associated with a particular difference in one of the input variables. If the true regression relationship involves interactions, then this predictive comparison can depend on the values of the other input variables. Therefore, one may wish to consider an average predictive comparison as a target of inference, where the averaging is with respect to the population distribution of the input variables. We consider inferences about such targets, with emphasis on inferential performance when the regression model is misspecified. Particularly, in light of the difficulties in dealing with interaction terms in regression models, we examine inferences about average predictive comparisons when additive models are fitted to relationships truly involving pairwise interaction terms. We identify some circumstances where such inferences are consistent despite the model misspecification, notably when the input variables are independent, or have a multivariate normal distribution.","Average predictive comparison,interaction,linear regression,misspecified model","ROBUSTNESS,REGRESSION,MODELS","Liu, Juxin@Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Math & Stat, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W0, Canada::Gustafson, Paul@Univ British Columbia, Dept Stat, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada","Liu, Juxin@University of Saskatchewan::Gustafson, Paul@University of British Columbia",not exist,"Heuristics of instability and stabilization in model selection+Breiman, L+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1996::INTERACTION+COX, DR; ATKINSON, AC; BOX, GEP; et al.+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+1984::INTERPRETATION OF INTERACTION: A REVIEW+De Gonzalez, Amy Berrington; Cox, D.

Estimating trends with percentage of smoothness chosen by the user,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2008.00047.x,AUG 2008,30,10,"This work presents a method for estimating trends of economic time series that allows the user to fix at the outset the desired percentage of smoothness for the trend. The calculations are based on the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter usually employed in business cycle analysis. The situation considered here is not related to that kind of analysis, but with describing the dynamic behaviour of the series by way of a smooth curve. To apply the filter, the user has to specify a smoothing constant that determines the dynamic behaviour of the trend.

Tests of bivariate exchangeability,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2008.00046.x,AUG 2008,19,3,"We discuss the hypothesis of bivariate exchangeability and show that testing bivariate exchangeability is related to the two-sample testing of equality of distribution functions. We consider three test statistics based on the ordering of the Euclidean interpoint distances. The runs test of exchangeability counts the runs among the observations and their mirror images on the minimal spanning tree. The nearest neighbour test of exchangeability is based on the number of nearest neighbour type coincidences among the observations and their folded images on the plane. The rank test of exchangeability compares the within and between ranks of the interpoint distances. We also consider the sign test of exchangeability, which uses the signs of the observations in specific regions, and a bootstrap test of exchangeability based on the maximum distance between the mirror images. We compare the power of these methods in a Monte Carlo study which shows different power orderings of the methods, depending on the alternative hypothesis.","runs test,nearest neighbour,bootstrap,interpoint distances,sign test,invariance","RANK-TESTS,SYMMETRY,INTERCHANGEABILITY,POPULATION,HYPOTHESES,LOCATION,SCALE","Modarres, Reza@George Washington Univ, Dept Stat, Washington, DC 20052 USA","Modarres, Reza@George Washington University",not exist,"BIVARIATE SYMMETRY TESTS - PARAMETRIC AND NONPARAMETRIC+BELL, CB; HALLER, HS+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1969::THE CHI-2 TEST OF GOODNESS OF FIT+COCHRAN, WG+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1952::MODIFIED RANDOMIZATION TESTS FOR NONPARAMETRIC HYPOTHESES+DWASS, M+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1957::A class of permutation tests of bivariate interchangeability+Ernst, MD; Schucany, WR+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1999::MULTIVARIATE GENERALIZATIONS OF THE WALD-WOLFOWITZ AND SMIRNOV 2-SAMPLE TESTS+FRIEDMAN, JH; RAFSKY, LC+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1979::A MULTIVARIATE 2-SAMPLE TEST BASED ON THE NUMBER OF NEAREST NEIGHBOR TYPE COINCIDENCES+HENZE, N+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 1988::NONPARAMETRIC TEST FOR BIVARIATE SYMMETRY+HOLLANDER, M+BIOMETRIKA+1971::COMPARISON OF TESTS FOR BIVARIATE SYMMETRY VERSUS LOCATION AND OR SCALE ALTERNATIVES+KEPNER, JL; RANDLES, RH+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1984::DETECTING UNEQUAL MARGINAL SCALES IN A BIVARIATE POPULATION+KEPNER, JL; RANDLES, RH+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1982::Reducing multidimensional two-sample data to one-dimensional interpoint comparisons+Maa, JF; Pearl, DK; Bartoszynski, R+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 1996::A DISTRIBUTION-FREE TEST FOR SYMMETRY BASED ON A RUNS STATISTIC+MCWILLIAMS, TP+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1990::Estimation of a bivariate symmetric distribution function+Modarres, R+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+MAY 15 2003::RANK-TESTS OF DISPERSION+MOSES, LE+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1963::HYPOTHESES GENERATING GROUPS FOR TESTING MULTIVARIATE SYMMETRY+RUSCHENDORF, L+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1976::NONPARAMETRIC TESTS FOR MULTIVARIATE INTERCHANGEABILITY .1.

Parametric and nonparametric regression in the presence of endogenous control variables,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2008.00045.x,AUG 2008,33,20,"The aim of this paper is to convey to a wider audience of applied statisticians that nonparametric (matching) estimation methods can be a very convenient tool to overcome problems with endogenous control variables. In empirical research one is often interested in the causal effect of a variable X on some outcome variable Y. With observational data, i.e. in the absence of random assignment, the correlation between X and Y generally does not reflect the treatment effect but is confounded by differences in observed and unobserved characteristics. Econometricians often use two different approaches to overcome this problem of confounding by other characteristics. First, controlling for observed characteristics, often referred to as selection on observables, or instrumental variables regression, usually with additional control variables. Instrumental variables estimation is probably the most important estimator in applied work. In many applications, these control variables are themselves correlated with the error term, making ordinary least squares and two-stage least squares inconsistent. The usual solution is to search for additional instrumental variables for these endogenous control variables, which is often difficult. We argue that nonparametric methods help to reduce the number of instruments needed. In fact, we need only one instrument whereas with conventional approaches one may need two, three or even more instruments for consistency. Nonparametric matching estimators permit root n consistent estimation without the need for (additional) instrumental variables and permit arbitrary functional forms and treatment effect heterogeneity.","endogeneity,nonparametric regression,instrumental variables,matching estimation","ESTIMATORS,CAUSALITY,MODELS,IDENTIFICATION,EXOGENEITY","Froelich, Markus@Univ Mannheim, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany","Froelich, Markus@University of Mannheim",not exist,"The colonial origins of comparative development: An empirical investigation+Acemoglu, D; Johnson, S; Robinson, JA+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+DEC 2001::How robust is the evidence on the effects of college quality?

Discovering statistically significant periodic gene expression,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2008.00048.x,AUG 2008,51,2,"One frequent application of microarray experiments is in the study of monitoring gene activities in a cell during cell cycle or cell division. High throughput gene expression time series data are produced from such microarray experiments. A new computational and statistical challenge for analyzing such gene expression time course data, resulting from cell cycle microarray experiments, is to discover genes that are statistically significantly periodically expressed during the cell cycle. Such a challenge occurs due to the large number of genes that are simultaneously measured, a moderate to small number of measurements per gene taken at different time points and high levels of non-normal random noises inherited in the data. Computational and statistical approaches to discovery and validation of periodic patterns of gene expression are, however, very limited. A good method of analysis should be able to search for significant periodic genes with a controlled family-wise error (FWE) rate or controlled false discovery rate (FDR) and any other variations of FDR, when all gene expression profiles are compared simultaneously. In this review paper, a brief summary of currently used methods in searching for periodic genes will be given. In particular, two methods will be surveyed in details. The first one is a novel statistical inference approach, the C & G Procedure that can be used to effectively detect statistically significantly periodically expressed genes when the gene expression is measured on evenly spaced time points. The second one is the Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis, which can be used to discover periodic genes when the gene profiles are not measured on evenly spaced time points or when there are missing values in the profiles. The ultimate goal of this review paper is to give an expository of the two surveyed methods to researchers in related fields.","gene expression,classical periodogram,Lomb-Scargle periodogram,FDR,periodic signals","TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS,HUMAN CELL-CYCLE,SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE,SEGMENTATION CLOCK,SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS,MICROARRAY DATA,SPACED DATA,IDENTIFICATION,MODEL,SYNCHRONIZATION","Chen, Jie@Univ Missouri, Dept Math & Stat, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA::Chang, Kuang-Chao@Fu Jen Catholic Univ, Dept Stat & Informat Sci, Taipei Hsien, Taiwan","Chen, Jie@University of Missouri Kansas City@University of Missouri System::Chang, Kuang-Chao@Fu Jen Catholic University",not exist,"A multi-step approach to time series analysis and gene expression clustering+Amato, R; Ciaramella, A; Deniskina, N; et al.+BIOINFORMATICS+MAR 1 2006::Clustering of gene expression data using a local shape-based similarity measure+Balasubramaniyan, R; Hullermeier, E; Weskamp, N; et al.+BIOINFORMATICS+APR 1 2005::Continuous representations of time-series gene expression data+Bar-Joseph, Z; Gerber, GK; Gifford, DK; et al.+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY+2003::Deconvolving cell cycle expression data with complementary information.+Bar-Joseph, Ziv; Farkash, Shlomit; Gifford, David K; et al.+Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)+2004-Aug-04::no title+BARTLETT MS+INTRO STOCHASTIC PRO+1966::CONTROLLING THE FALSE DISCOVERY RATE - A PRACTICAL AND POWERFUL APPROACH TO MULTIPLE TESTING+BENJAMINI, Y; HOCHBERG, Y+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1995::The transcriptome of the intraerythrocytic developmental cycle of Plasmodium falciparum+Bozdech, Z; Llinas, M; Pulliam, BL<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Wong, ED; Zhu, J; DeRisi, JL</span>.+PLoS Biol+2003::no title+Chatfield, C.+ANAL TIME SERIES INT+2003::Identification of significant periodic genes in microarray gene expression data+Chen, J+BMC BIOINFORMATICS+NOV 30 2005::Transcriptional regulation and function during the human cell cycle+Cho, RJ; Huang, MX; Campbell, MJ; et al.+NATURE GENETICS+JAN 2001::Circadian clocks and natural antisense RNA+Crosthwaite, SK+FEBS LETTERS+JUN 1 2004::Periodic Notch inhibition by lunatic fringe underlies the chick segmentation clock+Dale, JK; Maroto, M; Dequeant, ML; et al.+NATURE+JAN 16 2003::no title+Davis, H.

Many-valued logic in multistate and vague stochastic systems,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2008.00049.x,AUG 2008,32,2,"The state of the art in coherent structure theory is driven by two assertions, both of which are limiting: (1) all units of a system can exist in one of two states, failed or functioning; and (2) at any point in time, each unit can exist in only one of the above states. In actuality, units can exist in more than two states, and it is possible that a unit can simultaneously exist in more than one state. This latter feature is a consequence of the view that it may not be possible to precisely define the subsets of a set of states; such subsets are called vague. The first limitation has been addressed via work labeled 'multistate systems'; however, this work has not capitalized on the mathematics of many-valued propositions in logic. Here, we invoke its truth tables to define the structure function of multistate systems and then harness our results in the context of vagueness. A key contribution of this paper is to argue that many-valued logic is a common platform for studying both multistate and vague systems but, to do so, it is necessary to lean on several principles of statistical inference.","consistency profile,likelihood function,membership functions,reliability,probability,maintenance management,natural language,degradation modeling,decision making and utility","FUZZY-SETS,RELIABILITY,MODEL","Sellers, Kimberly F.@Georgetown Univ, Dept Math, Washington, DC 20057 USA::Singpurwalla, Nozer D.@George Washington Univ, Dept Stat, Washington, DC 20052 USA","Sellers, Kimberly F.@Georgetown University::Singpurwalla, Nozer D.@George Washington University","SINGPURWALLA, Nozer Darabsha@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3578-2308","no title+Barlow, R; Proschan, F.+Statistical Theory of Reliability and Life Testing+1975::Coherent systems with multi-state components+Barlow, R.E.; Wu, A.S.+Mathematics of Operations Research+Nov. 1978::STATISTICAL INFORMATION AND LIKELIHOOD+BASU, D+SANKHYA-THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS SERIES A+1975::CONTINUUM STRUCTURES .1.+BAXTER, LA+JOURNAL OF APPLIED PROBABILITY+1984::no title+BERTOLUZZA C+STAT MODELING ANAL M+2002::MULTI-COMPONENT SYSTEMS AND STRUCTURES AND THEIR RELIABILITY+BIRNBAUM, ZW; ESARY, JD; SAUNDERS, SC+TECHNOMETRICS+1961::no title+BLACK M+PHILOS SCI+1939::no title+CLAROTTI CA+ACCELERATED LIFE TES+1988::QUALITY-OF-LIFE ASSESSMENT - CAN WE KEEP IT SIMPLE+COX, DR; FITZPATRICK, R; FLETCHER, AE; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1992::DEGRADABLE SYSTEMS - A SURVEY OF MULTISTATE SYSTEM-THEORY+ELNEWEIHI, E; PROSCHAN, F+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1984::MULTISTATE COHERENT SYSTEMS+ELNEWEIHI, E; PROSCHAN, F; SETHURAMAN, J+JOURNAL OF APPLIED PROBABILITY+1978::no title+Feller, W.+An Introduction to Probability Theory and Its Applications+1968::MULTISTATE RELIABILITY MODELS+GRIFFITH, WS+JOURNAL OF APPLIED PROBABILITY+1980::Calibration regression of censored lifetime medical cost+Huang, YJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2002::no title+KASS RE+STATISTICIAN+1993::INFERENCE FOR A BERNOULLI PROCESS (A BAYESIAN VIEW)+LINDLEY, DV; PHILLIPS, LD+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+1976::On exchangeable, causal and cascading failures+Lindley, DV; Singpurwalla, ND+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 2002::no title+LUKASIEWICZ J+PHILOS REMARKS MANY+1930::Bayesian assessment of network reliability+Lynn, N; Singpurwalla, N; Smith, A+SIAM REVIEW+JUN 1998::no title+MALINOWSKI, Grzegorz.+ManyValued Logics+1993::A MULTIVARIATE EXPONENTIAL DISTRIBUTION+MARSHALL, AW; OLKIN, I+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1967::A SYSTEMS-MODEL FOR RELIABILITY STUDIES+MARSHALL, AW+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 1994::A RELIABILITY MODEL FOR SECTIONALIZED PRECIPITATORS+MATLAND, RH; SINGPURWALLA, ND+JOURNAL OF THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL ASSOCIATION+1981::2 SUGGESTIONS OF HOW TO DEFINE A MULTISTATE COHERENT SYSTEM+NATVIG, B+ADVANCES IN APPLIED PROBABILITY+1982::Integrated analysis of computer and physical experiments+Reese, CS; Wilson, AG; Hamada, M; et al.+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 2004::no title+RUSSELL B+AUSTRALAS J PHILOS+1923::Membership functions and probability measures of fuzzy sets+Singpurwalla, ND; Booker, JM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2004::LIMIT-THEOREMS AND APPROXIMATIONS FOR THE RELIABILITY OF LOAD-SHARING SYSTEMS+SMITH, RL+ADVANCES IN APPLIED PROBABILITY+1983::no title+SPIZZICHINO, F.+Subjective Probability Models for Lifetimes+2001::no title+Viertl, R.+Statistical methods for non-precise data+1996::Univariate statistical analysis with fuzzy data+Viertl, Reinhard+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+NOV 1 2006::FUZZY SETS+ZADEH, LA+INFORMATION AND CONTROL+1965"
A Bayesian multiple comparison procedure for order-restricted mixed models,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2008.00051.x,AUG 2008,26,5,"A Bayesian hierarchical mixed model is developed for multiple comparisons under a simple order restriction. The model facilitates inferences on the successive differences of the population means, for which we choose independent prior distributions that are mixtures of an exponential distribution and a discrete distribution with its entire mass at zero. We employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to obtain parameter estimates and estimates of the posterior probabilities that any two of the means are equal. The latter estimates allow one both to determine if any two means are significantly different and to test the homogeneity of all of the means. We investigate the performance of the model-based inferences with simulated data sets, focusing on parameter estimation and successive-mean comparisons using posterior probabilities. We then illustrate the utility of the model in an application based on data from a study designed to reduce lead blood concentrations in children with elevated levels. Our results show that the proposed hierarchical model can effectively unify parameter estimation, tests of hypotheses and multiple comparisons in one setting.","hierarchical model,MCMC,simple order restriction","VARIANCE-COMPONENTS,INFERENCE,PARAMETERS","Shang, Junfeng@Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA::Cavanaugh, Joseph E.@Univ Iowa, Dept Biostat, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA::Wright, Farroll T.@Univ Missouri, Dept Stat, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Shang, Junfeng@Bowling Green State University::Cavanaugh, Joseph E.@University of Iowa::Wright, Farroll T.@University of Missouri Columbia@University of Missouri System",not exist,"AN EMPIRICAL DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION FOR SAMPLING WITH INCOMPLETE INFORMATION+AYER, M; BRUNK, HD; EWING, GM; et al.+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1955::TESTING A POINT NULL HYPOTHESIS - THE IRRECONCILABILITY OF P-VALUES AND EVIDENCE+BERGER, JO; SELLKE, T+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1987::Safety and efficacy of succimer in toddlers with blood lead levels of 20-44 mu g/dL+Bornschein, RL; Chisolm, JJ; Damokosh, AI; et al.+PEDIATRIC RESEARCH+NOV 2000::no title+Box, GEP; Tiao, GC.+Bayesian Inference in Statistical Analysis+1992::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATES OF MONOTONE PARAMETERS+BRUNK, HD+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1955::no title+BRUNK HD+PAC J MATH+1957::A BAYESIAN-APPROACH TO THE ESTIMATION OF VARIANCE-COMPONENTS FOR THE UNBALANCED ONE-WAY RANDOM MODEL+CHALONER, K+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 1987::Bayesian inferences in the Cox model for order-restricted hypotheses+Dunson, DB; Herring, AH+BIOMETRICS+DEC 2003::no title+Fitzmaurice, G.

On the practice of rescaling covariates,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2008.00050.x,AUG 2008,29,10,"Whether doing parametric or nonparametric regression with shrinkage, thresholding, penalized likelihood, Bayesian posterior estimators (e.g., ridge regression, lasso, principal component regression, waveshrink or Markov random field), it is common practice to rescale covariates by dividing by their respective standard errors rho. The stated goal of this operation is to provide unitless covariates to compare like with like, especially when penalized likelihood or prior distributions are used. We contend that this vision is too simplistic. Instead, we propose to take into account a more essential component of the structure of the regression matrix by rescaling the covariates based on the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix Sigma of the maximum-likelihood estimator. We illustrate the differences between the standard rho- and proposed Sigma-rescalings with various estimators and data sets.","lasso,Markov random field,principal component regression,l(n) prior,ridge regression,wavelets","RIDGE-REGRESSION METHODS,WAVELET SHRINKAGE,DISTRIBUTIONS,CRITIQUE,MODELS,LASSO","Sardy, Sylvain@Univ Geneva, Sect Math, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland","Sardy, Sylvain@University of Geneva",not exist,"no title+BESAG J+J ROYAL STAT SOC B+1986::A comparative simulation study of wavelet shrinkage estimators for Poisson counts+Besbeas, P; De Feis, I; Sapatinas, T+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+AUG 2004::no title+BUEHLMANN P+STAT SCI+2007::Atomic decomposition by basis pursuit+Chen, SSB; Donoho, DL; Saunders, MA+SIAM JOURNAL ON SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING+1998::IDEAL SPATIAL ADAPTATION BY WAVELET SHRINKAGE+DONOHO, DL; JOHNSTONE, IM+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1994::Adapting to unknown smoothness via wavelet shrinkage+Donoho, DL; Johnstone, IM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1995::Least angle regression+Efron, B; Hastie, T; Johnstone, I; et al.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2004::MULTIVARIATE ADAPTIVE REGRESSION SPLINES+FRIEDMAN, JH+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+MAR 1991::FLEXIBLE PARSIMONIOUS SMOOTHING AND ADDITIVE MODELING+FRIEDMAN, JH; SILVERMAN, BW+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1989::A Haar-Fisz algorithm for Poisson intensity estimation+Fryzlewicz, P; Nason, GP+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+SEP 2004::Penalized regressions: The bridge versus the lasso+Fu, WJJ+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+SEP 1998::Improved prediction of body fat by measuring skinfold thickness, circumferences, and bone breadths+Garcia, AL; Wagner, K; Hothorn, T; et al.+OBESITY RESEARCH+MAR 2005::STOCHASTIC RELAXATION, GIBBS DISTRIBUTIONS, AND THE BAYESIAN RESTORATION OF IMAGES+GEMAN, S; GEMAN, D+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE+1984::no title+HOERL AE+TECHNOMETRICS+1970::Anomalies in the foundations of ridge regression+Jensen, Donald R.; Ramirez, Donald E.+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+APR 2008::Bayesian multiscale models for Poisson processes+Kolaczyk, ED+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1999::RIDGE REGRESSION IN PRACTICE+MARQUARDT, DW; SNEE, RD+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+1975::A CRITIQUE OF SOME RIDGE-REGRESSION METHODS - COMMENT+MARQUARDT, DW+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1980::PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS REGRESSION IN EXPLORATORY STATISTICAL RESEARCH+MASSY, WF+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1965::SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION OF GAMMA-RAY BURSTS OBSERVED BY BATSE+MEEGAN, CA; FISHMAN, GJ; WILSON, RB; et al.+NATURE+JAN 9 1992::GENERALIZED LINEAR MODELS+NELDER, JA; WEDDERBURN, RW+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-GENERAL+1972::Automatic smoothing with wavelets for a wide class of distributions+Sardy, S; Antoniadis, A; Tseng, P+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+JUN 2004::On the statistical analysis of smoothing by maximizing dirty Markov random field posterior distributions+Sardy, S; Tseng, P+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2004::ESTIMATING DIMENSION OF A MODEL+SCHWARZ, G+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1978::A CRITIQUE OF SOME RIDGE-REGRESSION METHODS+SMITH, G; CAMPBELL, F+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1980::Regression shrinkage and selection via the Lasso+Tibshirani, R+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1996::no title+Vapnik, V.+The nature of statistical learning theory+1995::Splines Models for Observational Data+Wahba, G.+SERIES APPL MATH+1990::Estimation of principal components and related models by iterative least squares+Wold, H.+J.

Econometric causality,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2007.00024.x,APR 2008,71,110,This paper presents the econometric approach to causal modelling. It is motivated by policy problems. New causal parameters are defined and identified to address specific policy problems. Economists embrace a scientific approach to causality and model the preferences and choices of agents to infer subjective (agent) evaluations as well as objective outcomes. Anticipated and realized subjective and objective outcomes are distinguished. Models for simultaneous causality are developed. The paper contrasts the Neyman-Rubin model of causality with the econometric approach.,"causality,econometrics,Roy model,Neyman-Rubin model,subjective and objective evaluations,anticipated vs. realized outcomes,counterfactuals,treatment effects","INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES,SOCIAL EXPERIMENTS,WAGE COMPARISONS,MODELS,INFERENCE,HETEROGENEITY,POLICY,IDENTIFICATION,SELECTION,BIAS","Heckman, James J.@Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA@Amer Bar Fdn, Chicago, IL 60611 USA@Univ Coll Dublin, Geary Inst, Dublin 2, Ireland","Heckman, James J.@University College Dublin@University of Chicago",not exist,"Instrumental variables estimates of the effect of subsidized training on the quantiles of trainee earnings+Abadie, A; Angrist, J; Imbens, G+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 2002::The nonparametric identification of treatment effects in duration models+Abbring, JH; Van den Berg, GJ+ECONOMETRICA+SEP 2003::no title+ABBRING JH+HDB ECONOMETRICS B+2007::no title+ABBRING JH+IN PRESS ECONOMETRIC+2007::no title+Amemiya, T.+Advanced Econometrics+1985::Identification of causal effects using instrumental variables+Angrist, JD; Imbens, GW; Rubin, DB+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1996::2-STAGE LEAST-SQUARES ESTIMATION OF AVERAGE CAUSAL EFFECTS IN MODELS WITH VARIABLE TREATMENT INTENSITY+ANGRIST, JD; IMBENS, GW+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1995::Statistical difficulties in determining the role of race in capital cases: A re-analysis of data from the state of Maryland+Berk, R; Li, A; Hickman, L+JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY+DEC 2005::THE ESTIMATION OF WAGE GAINS AND WELFARE GAINS IN SELF-SELECTION MODELS+BJORKLUND, A; MOFFITT, R+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+FEB 1987::Interactions-based models+Brock, WA; Durlauf, SN.+HDB ECONOMETRICS+2001::Estimating distributions of treatment effects with an application to the returns to schooling and measurement of the effects of uncertainty on college choice+Carneiro, P; Hansen, KT; Heckman, JJ+INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC REVIEW+MAY 2003::no title+CARNEIRO R+UNPUB AM EC REV+2006::Causation: One word, many things+Cartwright, N+PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE+DEC 2004::Learning, private information, and the economic evaluation of randomized experiments+Chan, Tat Y.; Hamilton, Barton H.+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+DEC 2006::no title+Cox, D.+Planning of Experiments+1958::no title+CUNHA E+FRONTIERS RES SOCIOL+2006::no title+CUNHA F+IN PRESS J POLIT EC+2007::Separating uncertainty from heterogeneity in life cycle earnings+Cunha, F; Heckman, J; Navarro, S+OXFORD ECONOMIC PAPERS-NEW SERIES+APR 2005::Causal inference without counterfactuals+Dawid, AP+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2000::Causal inference for complex longitudinal data: The continuous case+Gill, RD; Robins, JM+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 2001::no title+Goldberger, A.

Methods for generating longitudinally correlated binary data,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2007.00017.x,APR 2008,18,8,"The analysis of longitudinally correlated binary data has attracted considerable attention of late. Since the estimation of parameters in models for such data is based on asymptotic theory, it is necessary to investigate the small-sample properties of estimators by simulation. In this paper, we review the mechanisms that have been proposed for generating longitudinally correlated binary data. We compare and contrast these models with regard to various features, including computational efficiency, flexibility and the range restrictions that they impose on the longitudinal association parameters. Some extensions to the data generation mechanism originally suggested by Kanter (1975) are proposed.","data simulation,repeated binary measurements,stationary and non-stationary responses","VARIABLES,DISTRIBUTIONS,RESPONSES,MODELS","Farrell, Patrick J.@Carleton Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada::Rogers-Stewart, Katrina@Carleton Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada","Farrell, Patrick J.@Carleton University::Rogers-Stewart, Katrina@Carleton University",not exist,"no title+BAHADUR RR+STUDIES ITEM ANAL PR+1961::Efficiency of generalized estimating equations for binary responses+Chaganty, N.

Construction of exact simultaneous confidence bands for a simple linear regression model,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2007.00027.x,APR 2008,35,21,"A simultaneous confidence band provides a variety of inferences on the unknown components of a regression model. There are several recent papers using confidence bands for various inferential purposes; see for example, Sun et al (1999), Spurrier (1999), Al-Saidy et A (2003), Liu et al. (2004), Bhargava & Spurrier (2004), Piegorsch et al. (2005) and Liu et al. (2007). Construction of simultaneous confidence bands for a simple linear regression model has a rich history, going back to the work of Working & Hotelling (1929). The purpose of this article is to consolidate the disparate modern literature on simultaneous confidence bands in linear regression, and to provide expressions for the construction of exact 1 - alpha level simultaneous confidence bands for a simple linear regression model of either one-sided or two-sided form. We center attention on the three most recognized shapes: hyperbolic, two-segment, and three-segment (which is also referred to as a trapezoidal shape and includes a constant-width band as a special case). Some of these expressions have already appeared in the statistics literature, and some are newly derived in this article. The derivations typically involve a standard bivariate t random vector and its polar coordinate transformation.","simple linear regression,simultaneous inferences,bivariate normal,bivariate t,polar coordinators","AVERAGE-WIDTH OPTIMALITY,DOSE RISK-ESTIMATION,BOUNDS,INTERVALS","Liu, Wei@Univ Southampton, S3RI, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England@Univ Southampton, Sch Math, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England::Lin, Shan@Univ Southampton, S3RI, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England@Univ Southampton, Sch Math, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England::Piegorsch, Walter W.@Univ Arizona, Dept Math, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Liu, Wei@University of Southampton::Lin, Shan@University of Southampton::Piegorsch, Walter W.@University of Arizona","Piegorsch, Walter@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2725-5604::Liu, Wei@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4719-0345","Confidence bands for low-dose risk estimation with quantal response data+Al-Saidy, OM; Piegorsch, WW; West, RW; et al.+BIOMETRICS+DEC 2003::Exact confidence bounds for comparing two regression lines with a control regression line on a fixed interval+Bhargava, P; Spurrier, JD+BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL+DEC 2004::MULTIVARIATE TAU PROBABILITY INTEGRAL+BOHRER, R+BIOMETRIKA+1973::SHARP ONE-SIDED CONFIDENCE BOUNDS FOR LINEAR REGRESSION OVER INTERVALS+BOHRER, R; FRANCIS, GK+BIOMETRIKA+1972::SIMULTANEOUS CONFIDENCE BANDS FOR LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS+BOWDEN, DC+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1970::CONFIDENCE BANDS OF UNIFORM AND PROPORTIONAL WIDTH FOR LINEAR MODELS+BOWDEN, DC; GRAYBILL, FA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1966::CONFIDENCE BANDS IN STRAIGHT-LINE REGRESSION+GAFARIAN, AV+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1964::Easy-to-construct confidence bands for comparing two simple linear regression lines+Hayter, A.

Anomalies in the foundations of ridge regression,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2007.00041.x,APR 2008,24,18,"Errors persist in ridge regression, its foundations, and its usage, as set forth in Hoerl & Kennard (1970) and elsewhere. Ridge estimators need not be minimizing, nor a prospective ridge parameter be admissible. Conventional estimators are not LaGrange's solutions constrained to fixed lengths, as claimed, since such solutions are singular. Of a massive literature on estimation, prediction, cross-validation, choice of ridge parameter, and related issues, little emanates from constrained optimization to include inequality constraints. The problem traces to a misapplication of LaGrange's Principle, unrecognized singularities, and misplaced links between constraints and ridge parameters. Alternative principles, based on condition numbers, are seen to validate both conventional ridge and surrogate ridge regression to be defined. Numerical studies illustrate that ridge regression as practiced often exhibits pathologies it is intended to redress.","constrained optimization,incomplete use of LaGrange's method,non-singular distributions,alternative foundations","LINEAR-REGRESSION,SELECTION,VARIABLES","Jensen, Donald R.@Univ Virginia, Dept Math, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA::Ramirez, Donald E.@Univ Virginia, Dept Math, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA","Jensen, Donald R.@University of Virginia::Ramirez, Donald E.@University of Virginia","Ramirez, Donald@E-9422-2011@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2419-4538","RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VARIABLE SELECTION AND DATA AUGMENTATION AND A METHOD FOR PREDICTION+ALLEN, DM+TECHNOMETRICS+1974::no title+BALAKRISHNAN AV+J SIAM CONTROL     A+1963::ACCEPTABILITY OF REGRESSION SOLUTIONS - ANOTHER LOOK AT COMPUTATIONAL ACCURACY+BEATON, AE; RUBIN, DB; BARONE, JL+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1976::no title+Belsley, DA; Kuh, E; Welsch, RE.+Regression Diagnostics: Identifying Influential Data and Sources of Collinearity+1980::TOLERANCE AND CONDITION IN REGRESSION COMPUTATIONS+BERK, KN+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1977::EFFECT OF ERRORS IN INDEPENDENT VARIABLES IN LINEAR-REGRESSION+DAVIES, RB; HUTTON, B+BIOMETRIKA+1975::SIMULATION STUDY OF ALTERNATIVES TO ORDINARY LEAST-SQUARES+DEMPSTER, AP; SCHATZOFF, M; WERMUTH, N+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1977::RIDGE ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE SURFACES+DRAPER, NR+TECHNOMETRICS+1963::GENERALIZED CROSS-VALIDATION AS A METHOD FOR CHOOSING A GOOD RIDGE PARAMETER+GOLUB, GH; HEATH, M; WAHBA, G+TECHNOMETRICS+1979::ANALYSIS AND SELECTION OF VARIABLES IN LINEAR-REGRESSION+HOCKING, RR+BIOMETRICS+1976::RIDGE REGRESSION - SOME SIMULATIONS+HOERL, AE; KENNARD, RW; BALDWIN, KF+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS+1975::RIDGE REGRESSION - BIASED ESTIMATION FOR NONORTHOGONAL PROBLEMS+HOERL, AE; KENNARD, RW+TECHNOMETRICS+1970::A method for the solution of certain non-linear problems in least squares+Levenberg, K.+Quarterly of Applied Mathematics+07 1944::SOME COMMENTS ON CP+MALLOWS, CL+TECHNOMETRICS+1973::RIDGE REGRESSION IN PRACTICE+MARQUARDT, DW; SNEE, RD+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+1975::GENERALIZED INVERSES, RIDGE REGRESSION, BIASED LINEAR ESTIMATION, AND NONLINEAR ESTIMATION+MARQUARDT, DW+TECHNOMETRICS+1970::no title+Marshall, A.

In a variety of practical cases, one reasonable option is to consider distributions which include parameters to regulate their skewness and kurtosis. As a specific representative of this approach, the skew-t distribution is explored in more detail and reasons are given to adopt this option as a sensible general-purpose compromise between robustness and simplicity, both of treatment and of interpretation of the outcome. Some theoretical arguments, outcomes of a few simulation experiments and various wide-ranging examples with real data are provided in support of the claim.","kurtosis,maximum likelihood,multivariate distributions,profile likelihood,robustness,singular information matrix,skewness","REGRESSION-MODELS,ESTIMATORS,INFERENCE","Azzalini, Adelchi@Univ Padua, I-35100 Padua, Italy::Genton, Marc G.@Univ Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland@Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX USA","Azzalini, Adelchi@University of Padua::Genton, Marc G.@University of Geneva@Texas A&M University College Station@Texas A&M University System","Azzalini, Adelchi@A-6488-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7583-1269","The multivariate skew-normal distribution+Azzalini, A; DallaValle, A+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1996::Distributions generated by perturbation of symmetry with emphasis on a multivariate skew t-distribution+Azzalini, A; Capitanio, A+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2003::Statistical applications of the multivariate skew normal distribution+Azzalini, A; Capitanio, A+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1999::no title+Azzalini, A.+R package sn: The skew- normal and skew- t distributions (version 0. 4- 2)+2006::The skew-normal distribution and related multivariate families+Azzalini, A+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+JUN 2005::A CLASS OF DISTRIBUTIONS WHICH INCLUDES THE NORMAL ONES+AZZALINI, A+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+1985::On Gauss's characterization of the normal distribution+Azzalini, Adelchi; Genton, Marc G.+BERNOULLI+FEB 2007::no title+BAYES CL+IN PRESS BRAZ J PROB+2007::no title+BOX, G.

Virtual experiments and their use in teaching experimental design,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2007.00028.x,DEC 2007,15,9,"The ability to design experiments in an appropriate and efficient way is an important skill, but students typically have little opportunity to get that experience. Most textbooks introduce standard general-purpose designs, and then proceed with the analysis of data already collected. In this paper we explore a tool for gaining design experience: computer-based virtual experiments. These are software environments which mimic a real situation of interest and invite the user to collect data to answer a research question. Two prototype environments are described. The first one is suitable for a course that deals with screening or response surface designs, the second one allows experimenting with block and row-column designs. They are parts of a collection we developed called ENV2EXP, and can be freely used over the web. We also describe our experience in using them in several courses over the last few years.","design of experiments,teaching,data collection,applets,web-based teaching tools",STUDENTS,"Darius, Paul L.@Katholieke Univ Leuven, MEBIOS BIOSYSTEMS, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven Stat Ctr, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium::Portier, Kenneth M.@Amer Canc Soc, Natl Home Off, Atlanta, GA USA::Schrevens, Eddie@Katholieke Univ Leuven, BIORES M3, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium","Darius, Paul L.@KU Leuven::Portier, Kenneth M.@American Cancer Society::Schrevens, Eddie@KU Leuven",not exist,"no title+ANDERSONCOOK CM+ACTIVE LEARNING IN C+2001::Teaching engineers experimental design with a paper helicopter+Box, GEP.+Quality Engineering+1992::no title+BULMER M+P APPLE U CONSORTIUM+2003::no title+COBB G+INTRO DESIGN ANAL EX+2002::no title+DARIUS PL+ISI 2003 P+2003::no title+DARIUS PL+P COMPUTATIONAL STAT+2000::no title+Dean, AM; Voss, D.+Design and analysis of experiments+1998::no title+*EXPERIMENTATSCHOO+PROJ RUN ROYAL STAT+2007::SOME IDEAS ABOUT TEACHING DESIGN OF EXPERIMENTS, WITH 25 EXAMPLES OF EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED BY STUDENTS+HUNTER, WG+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+1977::A DYNAMIC TOMATO GROWTH AND YIELD MODEL (TOMGRO)+JONES, JW; DAYAN, E; ALLEN, LH; et al.+TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASAE+MAR-APR 1991::no title+MACGILLIVRAY HL+PRACTICAL DEV STAT U+1998::Human and animal arboviral diseases in Australia+Mackenzie, JS; Smith, DW; Ellis, TM.+Recent Advances in Microbiology+1994::SEQUENCE OF GAMES USEFUL IN TEACHING EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGN TO AGRICULTURE STUDENTS+POLLOCK, KH; ROSSPARKER, HM; MEAD, R+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+1979::no title+no author+R: a Language and Environment for Statistical Computing+2005::no title+SCHWARZ CJ+ONLINE SYSTEM TEACHI+2003"
"Dynamic, interactive documents for teaching statistical practice",INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2007.00025.x,DEC 2007,37,19,"Significant efforts have been made to overhaul the introductory statistics courses by placing greater emphasis on statistical thinking and literacy and less on rules, methods and procedures. We advocate broadening and increasing this effort to all levels of students and, importantly, using topical, interesting, substantive problems that come from the actual practice of statistics. We want students to understand the thought process of the ""masters"" in context, seeing their choices, different approaches and explorations. Similar to Open Source software, we think it is vital that the work of the community of researchers is accessible to the community of educators so that students can experience statistical applications and learn how to approach analyses themselves. We describe a mechanism by which one can collect all aspects or fragments of an analysis or simulation into a ""document"" so that the computations and results are reproducible, reusable and amenable to extensions. These documents contain various pieces of information (e.g. text, code, data, exploration paths) and can be processed to create regular descriptive papers in various formats (e.g. PDF, HTML), as well as acting as a database of the analysis which we can explore in rich new ways. Researchers, instructors and readers can control the various steps in the processing and rendering of the document. For example, this type of document supports interactive components with which a student can easily control and alter the inputs to the computations in a semi-guided fashion, gradually delve deeper into the details, and go on to her own free-form analysis. Our implementation for this system is based on widely used and standardized frameworks and readily supports multiple and different programming languages. Also, it is highly extensible which allows adaptation and future developments.","education,technology,XML,R",,"Nolan, Deborah@Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Stat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA::Lang, Duncan Temple@Univ Calif Davis, Dept Stat, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Nolan, Deborah@University of California System@University of California Berkeley::Lang, Duncan Temple@University of California System@University of California Davis","Temple Lang, Duncan@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0159-1546","no title+COBB GW+AM MATH MON+1997::Mathematics, statistics, and teaching+Cobb, GW; Moore, DS+AMERICAN MATHEMATICAL MONTHLY+NOV 1997::no title+DEVEAUX RD+STAT DATA MODELS+2007::no title+DRAKE L+GTKDEVICE LOADABLE E+2005::no title+Freedman, D.; Pisani, R.; Purves, R.+Statistics+1998::COMPASS: A probabilistic indoor positioning system based on 802. 11 and digital compasses+King, T.; Kopf, S.; Haenselmann, T.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Lubberger, C.; Effelsberg, W</span>.+P 1 INT WORKSH WIR N+2006::no title+KRISHNAN P+P IEEE INFOCOM 2004+2004::no title+LANG DT+IDYNDOCS INTERACTIVE+2007::no title+LANG DT+OMEGAHAT PROJECT+2007::no title+LANG DT+RDCOM BUNDLE PACKAGE+2005::no title+LANG DT+RWXDEVICE R GRAPHICS+2006::no title+LANG DT+RWXWIDGETS INTERFACE+2007::no title+LANG DT+SSOAP CLIENT SIDE SO+2006::no title+LANG DT+SXSLT PACKAGE+2007::no title+LANG DT+XML PACKAGE S LANGUA+2006::Sweave: dynamic generation of statistical reports using literate data analysis+Leisch, F.+Compstat+2002::Location estimation in wireless networks: A Bayesian approach+Madigan, D; Ju, WH; Krishnan, P; et al.+STATISTICA SINICA+APR 2006::STATISTICS EDUCATION FIN-DE-SIECLE+MOORE, DS; COBB, GW; GARFIELD, J; et al.+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 1995::Quality and relevance in the first statistics course+Moore, DS+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+AUG 2005::New pedagogy and new content: The case of statistics+Moore, DS+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+AUG 1997::no title+Nolan, D; Terry, S.+Stat labs: mathematical statistics through applications+2000::no title+PECK R+STAT GUIDE UNKNOWN+2004::no title+no author+R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing+2006::no title+Ramsey, F; Schafer, D.+The Statistical Sleuth+2002::Emacs speaks statistics: A multiplatform, multipackage development environment for statistical analysis+Rossini, AJ; Heiberger, RM; Sparapani, RA; et al.+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+MAR 2004::no title+ROSSMAN A+NOTE JSM 2003 MATH S+2003::no title+SCHEAFFER RL+ACTIVITY BASED STAT+1996::no title+SWAYNE DF+GGOBI DATA VISUALIZA+2007::no title+URBANEK S+IPLOTS IPLOTS INTERA+2007::no title+UTTS J+MIND STAT+2003::no title+Utts, J.

Virtual environments and the acceleration of experiential learning,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2007.00033.x,DEC 2007,19,6,"Darius et A (2007) and Nolan & Temple Lang (2007) give examples of virtual environments that can, for specific purposes, substitute for the real world. We are in the early stages of developments that could revolutionize statistics education by making it possible to capture efficiently important aspects of the thinking and practice of professional statisticians previously learned only from long years of experience. The ability of virtual environments to automate processes provides a potent weapon for tackling the tyranny that Time exercises over such modes of learning. We discuss the many new possibilities that are opened up by virtual environments together with cognitive and pedagogical imperatives to be addressed to ensure that environments actually do teach the lessons they were designed to teach. We echo Nolan and Temple Lang's call for the development of environments to be modular and open source. Taking the R-project as a model, this can lead to a growing repository of building blocks that make the construction of future environments less costly, thus facilitating the realization of more and more ambitious conceptions.","experimental design,interactive learning environments,java applets,open source development,statistical thinking","STATISTICAL THINKING,COGNITIVE LOAD,INQUIRY","Wild, Chris@Univ Auckland, Auckland 1, New Zealand","Wild, Chris@University of Auckland","Wild, Christopher@A-1449-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0115-6448","no title+BULMER M+CAL LAB+2004::no title+BULMER M+P APPLE U CONSORTIUM+2003::One possible frame for thinking about experiential learning+Cobb, George W.+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+DEC 2007::Virtual experiments and their use in teaching experimental design+Darius, Paul L.; Portier, Kenneth M.; Schrevens, Eddie+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+DEC 2007::Assessment and statistics education: Current challenges and directions+Garfield, JB; Gal, I+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+APR 1999::How students learn statistics revisited: A current review of research on teaching and learning statistics+Garfield, Joan; Ben-Zvi, Dani+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+DEC 2007::Statistical analyses and reproducible research+Gentleman, Robert; Lang, Duncan Temple+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+MAR 2007::Enhancing instructional efficiency of interactive E-learning environments: A cognitive load perspective+Kalyuga, Slava+EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW+SEP 2007::Nine ways to reduce cognitive load in multimedia learning+Mayer, RE; Moreno, R+EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGIST+WIN 2003::Interactive multimodal learning environments+Moreno, Roxana; Mayer, Richard+EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW+SEP 2007::no title+*NAT RES COUNC+NAT SCI ED STAND OBS+1963::Scientific inquiry in educational multi-user virtual environments+Nelson, Brian C.; Ketelhut, Diane Jass+EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW+SEP 2007::Dynamic, interactive documents for teaching statistical practice+Nolan, Deborah; Lang, Duncan Temple+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+DEC 2007::no title+no author+R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing+2007::no title+SCHWARZ CJ+J STAT ED+1997::Discussion: Development and use of statistical thinking: a new era+Snee, RD+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+DEC 1999::An interview with Richard Mayer+Veronikas, S; Shaughnessy, MF; Mayer, R+EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW+JUN 2005::EMBRACING THE WIDER VIEW OF STATISTICS+WILD, CJ+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1994::Statistical thinking in empirical enquiry+Wild, CJ; Pfannkuch, M+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+DEC 1999"

The interactive multimedia technology of today allows for the creation of powerful learning environments where the focus is on the process that produced the data and its associated variation and the statistical thinking required to solve the problem. However, despite this optimistic view, students' self-regulation and intrinsic motivation seem to be key concepts for learning in complex interactive computer-based learning environments.

Foundational value of statistics education for management curriculum,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2007.00032.x,DEC 2007,24,1,"The purpose of this paper is to propose a unique and distinct value of statistics education for management. The 1986 inaugural conference on Making Statistics More Effective in Schools of Business (MSMESB) proposed valuable guidelines for reforming statistics education in schools of business. However, a survey conducted by McAlevey & Everett (2001) identified that their impact has been minimal, and argued that structural problems many business schools have are the potential cause. We argue these structural problems exist because the value of the body of statistical tools for management is ambiguous and has not been made explicit. The unique and distinct value of statistics for management can be identified as the body of tools necessary to meet the inherent needs of a manager charged with making predictive judgments facing data. The need arises because human information-processing capacity is quite limited, as the findings of researchers in cognitive psychology testify. These findings also affirm that the basic statistical concepts needed for processing data cannot be learned from management experiences.

The model of a manager faced with data, while considering the evidence of inherent limitations of human information-processing capacity, establishes the foundational value of statistics training in the management curriculum. Statistics education in business schools will be made more effective when management educators recognize such value of the discipline, lend their support and reward the ownership commitment for continuous improvement and innovations of the business statistics curriculum.","human information-processing,education,decision making,predictive judgment,statistical modelling","BUSINESS STATISTICS,SCHOOLS","Tamura, Hirokuni@Univ Washington, Michael G Foster Sch Business, Dept Informat Syst & Operat Management, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Tamura, Hirokuni@University of Washington Seattle@University of Washington",not exist,"ROBUST BEAUTY OF IMPROPER LINEAR-MODELS IN DECISION-MAKING+DAWES, RM+AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST+1979::MAKING STATISTICS MORE EFFECTIVE IN SCHOOLS OF BUSINESS+EASTON, G; ROBERTS, HV; TIAO, GC+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+APR 1988::no title+Gladwell, M.+&lt;IT&gt;Blink&lt;/IT&gt;+2005::Spurious regression in econometrics+Granger, C.W.J.; Newbold, P.+J.

Modelling & controlling monetary and economic identities with constrained state space models,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2007.00012.x,AUG 2007,17,5,"The paper presents a method for modelling and controlling time series with identity structures. The approach is presented in the context of monetary targeting where the monetary identity (e.g. reserve money equals net foreign assets plus domestic credit) is modelled using a constrained state space model and next-period changes in domestic credit (policy variable) are estimated to reach the target level of reserve money. The constrained modelling ensures that aggregation and identity relations among items are dynamically satisfied during estimation, leading to more accurate forecasting and targeting.

Applications to Germany, UK and USA show that the constrained state space model provides significant improvements in targeting and forecasting performance over the AR(1) benchmark and the unconstrained model. Reduction in the mean square error of targeting over AR(1) is in the range of 76-95% for the three countries while the gain in targeting efficiency over unconstrained modelling is between 21% and 55%. Beyond monetary targeting, the method has wide application to the dynamic modelling and control of economic and financial time series with identity and aggregation constraints (e.g. balance of payment, national income, purchasing power parity, company balance sheet).","structural state space models,constrained Kalman filter,economic identities","LINEAR RESTRICTIONS,KALMAN FILTER","Pandher, Gurupdesh S.@Depaul Univ, Dept Finance, Chicago, IL 60604 USA","Pandher, Gurupdesh S.@DePaul University",not exist,"no title+Agenor, P-R.; Montiel, P.J.+Development Macroeconomics+1999::no title+BLEJER M+WP0131 IMF+2001::no title+Brockwell, P.; Davis, R.; Series, Time.+Theory and Methods+1991::THE DIFFUSE KALMAN FILTER+DEJONG, P+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 1991::Applying linear time-varying constraints to econometric models: With an application to demand systems+Doran, HE; Rambaldi, AN+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUL 1997::CONSTRAINING KALMAN FILTER AND SMOOTHING ESTIMATES TO SATISFY TIME-VARYING RESTRICTIONS+DORAN, HE+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+AUG 1992::Benchmarking by state space models+Durbin, J; Quenneville, B+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+APR 1997::no title+FISCHER S+MODERN APPROACHES CE+1995::BAYESIAN FORECASTING+HARRISON, PJ; STEVENS, CF+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1976::no title+Harvey, A.

On tests for a normal mean with known coefficient of variation,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2007.00019.x,AUG 2007,12,9,"Hinkley (1977) derived two tests for testing the mean of a normal distribution with known coefficient of variation (c.v.) for right alternatives. They are the locally most powerful (LMP) and the conditional tests based on the ancillary statistic for p. In this paper, the likelihood ratio (LR) and Wald tests are derived for the one- and two-sided alternatives, as well as the two-sided version of the LMP test. The performances of these tests are compared with those of the classical t, sign and Wilcoxon signed rank tests. The latter three tests do not use the information on c.v. Normal approximation is used to approximate the null distribution of the test statistics except for the t test. Simulation results indicate that all the tests maintain the type-1 error rates, that is, the attained level is close to the nominal level of significance of the tests. The power functions of the tests are estimated through simulation. The power comparison indicates that for one-sided alternatives the LMP test is the best test whereas for the two-sided alternatives the LR or the Wald test is the best test. The t, sign and Wilcoxon signed rank tests have lower power than the LMP, LR and Wald tests at various alternative values of p. The power difference is quite large in several simulation configurations. Further, it is observed that the t, sign and Wilcoxon signed rank tests have considerably lower power even for the alternatives which are far away from the null hypothesis when the c.v. is large. To study the sensitivity of the tests for the violation of the normality assumption, the type I error rates are estimated on the observations of lognormal, gamma and uniform distributions. The newly derived tests maintain the type I error rates for moderate values of c.v.","coefficient of variation,mean of a normal distribution,locally most powerful test,likelihood ratio test,Wald test,type I error rates,power comparison,robustness",,"Bhat, Kavitha@Mangalore Univ, Dept Stat, Mangalore 574199, India::Rao, K.

Statistical disclosure control methods for census frequency tables,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2007.00010.x,AUG 2007,8,13,"This paper provides a review of common statistical disclosure control (SDC) methods implemented at statistical agencies for standard tabular outputs containing whole population counts from a census (either enumerated or based on a register). These methods include record swapping on the microdata prior to its tabulation and rounding of entries in the tables after they are produced. The approach for assessing SDC methods is based on a disclosure risk-data utility framework and the need to find a balance between managing disclosure risk while maximizing the amount of information that can be released to users and ensuring high quality outputs. To carry out the analysis, quantitative measures of disclosure risk and data utility are defined and methods compared. Conclusions from the analysis show that record swapping as a sole SDC method leaves high probabilities of disclosure risk. Targeted record swapping lowers the disclosure risk, but there is more distortion of distributions. Small cell adjustments (rounding) give protection to census tables by eliminating small cells but only one set of variables and geographies can be disseminated in order to avoid disclosure by differencing nested tables. Full random rounding offers more protection against disclosure by differencing, but margins are typically rounded separately from the internal cells and tables are not additive. Rounding procedures protect against the perception of disclosure risk compared to record swapping since no small cells appear in the tables. Combining rounding with record swapping raises the level of protection but increases the loss of utility to census tabular outputs. For some statistical analysis, the combination of record swapping and rounding balances to some degree opposing effects that the methods have on the utility of the tables.","disclosure risk measures,data utility measures,R-U confidentiality map",,"Shlomo, Natalie@Univ Southampton, Stat Sci Res Inst, Southampton SO17 IBJ, Hants, England@Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Stat, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel","Shlomo, Natalie@University of Southampton@Hebrew University of Jerusalem",not exist,"no title+BOYD M+UNECE EUR WORK SESS+1999::no title+CARTER R+ONS INTERNAL REPORT+2000::no title+DUNCAN G+LAUR016428 AL NAT LA+2001::Distortion measures for categorical data swapping+Gomatam,, S.; Karr,, A.F.+Technical report 131+2003::A Risk Utility Framework for Categorical Data Swapping+Gomatam, S.; Karr, A.; Sanil, A.+Technical Report Number 132+2003::Post randomisation for statistical disclosure control: theory and implementation+Gouweleeuw, J; Kooiman, P; Willenborg, L.+J Offical Stat+1998::The casc project+Hundepool, A.+LECT NOTES COMPUTER+2002::Elements of Statistical Disclosure Control+WILLENBORG, L.; DE WAAL, T.+LECT NOTES STAT+2001"

On the construction of imputation classes in surveys,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2006.00002.x,APR 2007,18,16,"This paper explores the problem of the construction of imputation classes using the score method, sometimes called predictive mean stratification or response propensity stratification, depending on the context. This method was studied in Thomsen (1973), Little (1986) and Eltinge & Yansaneh (1997). We use a different framework to evaluate the properties of the resulting imputed estimator of a population mean. In our framework, we condition on the realized sample. This enables us to considerably simplify our theoretical developments in the frequent situation where the boundaries and the number of classes are sample-dependent. We find that the key factor for reducing the non-response bias is to form classes homogeneous with respect to the response probabilities and/or the conditional expectation of the variable of interest. In the latter case, the non-response/imputation variance is also reduced. Finally, we performed a simulation study to fully evaluate various versions of the score method and to compare them with a cross-classification method, which is frequently used in practice. The results showed the superiority of the score method in general.","classification algorithm,cross-classification method,imputation model,non-response and imputation variance,non-response model,non-response bias,score method","VARIANCE-ESTIMATION,MISSING DATA","Haziza, David@Univ Montreal, Dept Math & Stat, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada@STAT Canada, Business Survey Methods Div, Ottawa, ON, Canada::Beaumont, Jean-Francois@Univ Montreal, Dept Math & Stat, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada@STAT Canada, Business Survey Methods Div, Ottawa, ON, Canada","Haziza, David@University of Montreal@Statistics Canada::Beaumont, Jean-Francois@University of Montreal@Statistics Canada",not exist,"CALIBRATION ESTIMATORS IN SURVEY SAMPLING+DEVILLE, JC; SARNDAL, CE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1992::Diagnostics for Formation of Nonresponse Adjustment Cells, with an Application to Income Nonresponse in the US Consumer Expenditure Survey+Eltinge, J.

Regional inequalities in consumption patterns: A multilevel approach to the case of Italy,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2006.00004.x,APR 2007,25,1,"The main aim of this paper is to evaluate the disparities in the Italian regions on the demand side. In more detail, an attempt will be made to find if the consumption behaviour of Italian households is different in the regions. With this in mind, Istat's 2000 Italian Family Budget data set was analysed. The data in question, which were collected through a two-stage sample over Italy's 20 regions, contains information regarding the expenses of approximately 23,000 households. In this analysis, both households and regions are considered as units: households are nested in the regions so that the basic data structure is hierarchical. In order to take this hierarchical structure into account, a multilevel model was used, making it possible for parameters to vary randomly from region to region. The model in question also made it possible to consider heterogeneity across different groups (regions), such as stochastic variation. First, regional inequalities were tested using a simple model in which households constituted the first level of analysis and were grouped according to their region (the second level). As a second step, and in order to investigate the interaction between geographical context and income distribution, another model was used. This was cross-classified by income and regions. The most relevant results showed that there is wide fragmentation of consumption behaviour and, at the same time, various differentiated types of behaviour in the regions under analysis. These territorial differentials become clear from income class and items of consumption.","consumption patterns,multilevel model,regional inequalities",MODEL,"Bono, Filippa@Univ Palermo, Dept Contabil Nazl & Anal Proc Sociali, I-90128 Palermo, Italy::Cuffaro, Miranda@Univ Palermo, Dept Contabil Nazl & Anal Proc Sociali, I-90128 Palermo, Italy::Giaimo, Rosa@Univ Palermo, Dept Contabil Nazl & Anal Proc Sociali, I-90128 Palermo, Italy","Bono, Filippa@University of Palermo - Italy::Cuffaro, Miranda@University of Palermo - Italy::Giaimo, Rosa@University of Palermo - Italy",not exist,"Calorie intake and income elasticities in EU countries: A convergence analysis using cointegration+Angulo, AM; Gil, JM; Gracia, A+PAPERS IN REGIONAL SCIENCE+APR 2001::WHAT DO WE LEARN ABOUT CONSUMER DEMAND PATTERNS FROM MICRO DATA+BLUNDELL, R; PASHARDES, P; WEBER, G+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+JUN 1993::no title+Bock, R.

This paper is about connecting distributions on these supports via 'natural' simple transformations in such a way that tail properties are preserved. In particular, this work is focussed on the case where the tails (at +/-infinity) of densities are heavy, decreasing as a (negative) power of their argument; connections are then especially elegant. At boundaries (0 and 1), densities behave conformably with a directly related dependence on power of argument. The transformation from (0,1) to R+ is the standard odds transformation. The transformation from R+ to R is a novel identity-minus-reciprocal transformation. The main points of contact with existing distributions are with the transformations involved in the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution and, especially, the Johnson family of distributions.

"Governance, democracy and poverty reduction: Lessons drawn from household surveys in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America",INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2006.00005.x,APR 2007,24,8,"Public statistics face quite a challenge when it comes to measuring new dimensions of development (institutions, governance, and social and political participation). To take up this challenge, modules on Governance, Democracy and Multiple Dimensions of Poverty have been appended to household surveys by National Statistics Institutes in twelve African and Latin American developing countries. This paper presents the issues addressed and the methodological lessons learnt along with a selection of findings to illustrate this innovative approach and demonstrate its analytic potential. We investigate, for instance, the population's support for democratic principles, the respect for civil and political rights and the trust in the political class; the 'need for the State', particularly of the poorest; the extent of petty corruption; the reliability of expert surveys on governance; the perception of decentralization policies at local level; the level and vitality of social and political participation, etc. The conclusive appraisal made opens up prospects for the national statistical information systems in the developing countries. The measurement and tracking of this new set of objective and subjective public policy monitoring indicators would benefit from being made systematic.","Africa,Latin America,democracy,monitoring mechanism,household surveys,governance,poverty,corruption,development policy,statistical systems",,"Herrera, Javier@IRD Paris, DIAL, F-75010 Paris, France::Razafindrakoto, Mireille@IRD Paris, DIAL, F-75010 Paris, France::Roubaud, Francois@IRD Paris, DIAL, F-75010 Paris, France","Herrera, Javier@Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD)::Razafindrakoto, Mireille@Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD)::Roubaud, Francois@Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD)",not exist,"no title+Bratton, M.; Mattes, R.; Gyimah-Boadi, E.+Public Opinion, Democracy, and Market Reform in Africa+2005::no title+no author+New International Poverty Reduction Strategies+2003::Does economic growth improve the human lot?

Poisson regression for clustered data,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2006.00003.x,APR 2007,28,4,"We compare five methods for parameter estimation of a Poisson regression model for clustered data: (1) ordinary (naive) Poisson regression (OP), which ignores intracluster correlation, (2) Poisson regression with fixed cluster-specific intercepts (FI), (3) a generalized estimating equations (GEE) approach with an equi-correlation matrix, (4) an exact generalized estimating equations (EGEE) approach with an exact covariance matrix, and (5) maximum likelihood (NIL). Special attention is given to the simplest case of the Poisson regression with a cluster-specific intercept random when the asymptotic covariance matrix is obtained in closed form. We prove that methods 1-5, except GEE, produce the same estimates of slope coefficients for balanced data (an equal number of observations in each cluster and the same vectors of covariates). All five methods lead to consistent estimates of slopes but have different efficiency for unbalanced data design. It is shown that the FI approach can be derived as a limiting case of maximum likelihood when the cluster variance increases to infinity. Exact asymptotic covariance matrices are derived for each method. In terms of asymptotic efficiency, the methods split into two groups: OP & GEE and EGEE & FI & NIL. Thus, contrary to the existing practice, there is no advantage in using GEE because it is substantially outperformed by EGEE and FI. In particular, EGEE does not require integration and is easy to compute with the asymptotic variances of the slope estimates close to those of the ML.","asymptotic efficiency,GEE,generalized estimating equations,clustered data,count data,maximum likelihood,overdispersion,quasi-likelihood","LINEAR MIXED MODELS,LONGITUDINAL DATA,MISSPECIFICATION,INFERENCE","Demidenko, Eugene@Dartmouth Coll Sch Med, Hanover, NH 03755 USA","Demidenko, Eugene@Dartmouth College",not exist,"no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical Data Analysis+2002::no title+BRESLOW NE+APPL STAT-J ROY ST C+1984::BIAS CORRECTION IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS WITH A SINGLE-COMPONENT OF DISPERSION+BRESLOW, NE; LIN, XH+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1995::APPROXIMATE INFERENCE IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS+BRESLOW, NE; CLAYTON, DG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::no title+Cameron, A; Trivedi, P.+Regression Analysis of Count Data+1998::no title+Carroll, R.J.; Ruppert, D.; Stefanski, L.+Nonlinear Measurement Error Models+1995::no title+Carroll, R.

Comparison of benchmarking methods with and without a survey error model,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,DEC 2006,18,7,"For a target socio-economic variable, two sources of data with different precisions and collecting frequencies may be available. Typically, the less frequent data (e.g., annual report or census) are more reliable and are considered as benchmarks. The process of using them to adjust the more frequent and less reliable data (e.g., repeated monthly surveys) is called benchmarking.

In this paper, we show the relationship among three types of benchmarking methods in the literature, namely the Denton (original and modified), the regression, and the signal-extraction methods. A new method called ""quasi-linear regression"" is proposed under the multiplicative assumption. The numerical Denton method is currently widely used. The aim of this paper is to promote the other two methods which are statistically model-based; the model for the survey error is assumed to be known. Assuming the survey-error series follows an autoregressive model of order 1, by simulation, we investigate the impact of misspecification of the model on the benchmarking prediction according to the criterion of minimizing the root-mean-squared error of prediction. It is concluded that both statistical methods have great advantages over the Denton method and they are robust to misspecification of the survey-error model. The problem of how to obtain a survey-error model is also mentioned.","Denton method,regression,signal extraction,ARMA model,DS and TS model","TIME-SERIES,SIGNAL EXTRACTION,INTERPOLATION,EXTRAPOLATION,ADJUSTMENT","Chen, Zhao-Guo@STAT Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada@Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China::Wu, Ka Ho@STAT Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada@Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Chen, Zhao-Guo@Statistics Canada@Chinese University of Hong Kong::Wu, Ka Ho@Statistics Canada@Chinese University of Hong Kong",not exist,"no title+BASSI VL+EC FORECASTING+1958::no title+Bloem, A.

Causality and causal models: A conceptual perspective,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,DEC 2006,94,9,"This paper aims at displaying a synthetic view of the historical development and the current research concerning causal relationships, starting from the Aristotelian doctrine of causes, following with the main philosophical streams until the middle of the twentieth century, and commenting on the present intensive research work in the statistical domain. The philosophical survey dwells upon various concepts of cause, and some attempts towards picking out spurious causes. Concerning statistical modelling, factorial models and directed acyclic graphs are examined and compared. Special attention is devoted to randomization and pseudo-randomization (for observational studies) in view of avoiding the effect of possible confounders. An outline of the most common problems and pitfalls, encountered in modelling empirical data, closes the paper, with a warning to be very cautious in modelling and inferring conditional independence between variables.","causality,causal models,directed acyclic graph,confounder,counterfactual","CONDITIONAL-INDEPENDENCE,CONTINGENCY-TABLES,INFERENCE,ASSOCIATION,COUNTERFACTUALS,RANDOMIZATION,EXPLANATION,STATISTICS,DIAGRAMS,GRAPHS","Frosini, Benito V.@Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Ist Stat, Milan, Italy","Frosini, Benito V.@Catholic University of the Sacred Heart",not exist,"no title+Aickin, M.+Causal Analysis in Biomedicine and Epidemiology Based on Minimal Sufficient Causation+2002::The Problem of Causality+Anderson, John.+Australian Journal of Psychology and Philosophy+1938::A characterization of Markov equivalence classes for acyclic digraphs+Andersson, SA; Madigan, D; Perlman, MD+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 1997::no title+Aristotle.+Analytica Posteriora+1928::no title+Aristotle.+The Works of Aristotle+1930::Causal reasoning from longitudinal data+Arjas, E; Parner, J+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+JUN 2004::MODELS OF FEMALE ORGASM+BENTLER, PM; PEELER, WH+ARCHIVES OF SEXUAL BEHAVIOR+1979::no title+Berger, J.+Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis+1985::Sex Bias in Graduate Admissions: Data From Berkeley+Bickel, Peter; Hammel, E.; O'Connell, J.+Statistics and Public Policy+1977::no title+Blau, P; Duncan, O D.+The American Occupational Structure[M]+1967::no title+Carnap, R.+Logical Foundations of Probability+1950::no title+Carnap, R.+The Logical Foundations of Probability+1962::no title+Copi, I.

Improving statistics on international migration in Asia,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,DEC 2006,59,7,"International migration has reached unprecedented scale, diversity and political, economic, social and demographic significance in Asia over the last decade. Despite this data collection of migrant stocks and flows remains very limited in most Asian countries. Accordingly, policy making on migration in the region lacks an evidence base and is influenced by interest groups, anecdotal evidence and prejudice. This paper argues that the heightened security consciousness since 911 together with the development of efficient computer based collection and analysis of migration data systems has created a propitious environment for bringing about a parametric improvement in data collection on international migration in Asia. A number of suggestions are made in this regard, especially the inclusion of relevant international migration questions in the 2010 round of population censuses.","census,diasporas,Asia,international migration,migrant stocks and flows",,"Hugo, Graeme@Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia","Hugo, Graeme@University of Adelaide",not exist,"no title+*ABS+29030 ABS+2000::Developing the diaspora+no author+3 COORD M INT MIGR P+2004::no title+no author+AS MIGR YB 1999+1999::no title+Bilsborrow,, R.

Towards an integrated statistical system at Statistics Netherlands,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,DEC 2006,31,0,"Changes in circumstances put pressure on Statistics Netherlands (SN) to redesign the way its statistics are produced. Key developments are: the changing needs of data-users, growing competition, pressure to reduce the survey burden on enterprises, emerging new technologies and methodologies and, first and foremost, the need for more efficiency because of budget cuts.

This paper describes how SN, and especially its business statistics, can adapt to these new circumstances. We envisage an optimum situation as one with a single standardised production line for all statistics and a central data repository at its core. This single production line is supported by generic and standardised tools, metadata and workflow management.

However, it is clear that such an optimum situation cannot be realised in just a few years. It should be seen as the point on the horizon. Therefore, we also describe the first transformation steps from the product-based stovepipe-oriented statistical process of the past to a more integrated process of the future.

A similar modernisation process exists in the area of social statistics. In the near future both systems of business and social statistics are expected to connect at pivotal points and eventually converge on one overall business architecture for SN. Discussions about such an overall business architecture for SN have already been started and the first core projects have been set up.","official statistics,process redesign,integrated statistics,output driven,metadata infrastructure,workflow management,data repository,output data warehouse,strategy,stovepipe model",,"Heerschap, Nico@Stat Netherlands, Voorburg, Netherlands::Willenborg, Leon@Stat Netherlands, Voorburg, Netherlands","Heerschap, Nico@Unknow::Willenborg, Leon@Unknow",not exist,"no title+*ABS+SURV STAT+2004::no title+BETHLEHEM J+UNECE WORK SESS STAT+1999::no title+*CBS+REK STAT ICT MAST IN+2005::no title+*CBS BES+BEET BUS STAT EFF EF+2005::Statistical integration through metadata management+Colledge, MJ+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+APR 1999::no title+COOK L+MANAGING NETWORKED S+1999::no title+Donaldson, L.+The contingency theory of organizations+2001::no title+DUNNET G+ISI C 2005 SYDN AUST+2005::no title+FROESCHL KA+METADATA MANAGEMENT+1997::no title+Gates, W.H.; Hamingway, C.+Business @ the speed of thought: using a digital nervous system+1999::Design principles for a unified statistical data/metadata system+Gillman, DW; Appel, MV; LaPlant, WP+EIGHTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SCIENTIFIC AND STATISTICAL DATABASE SYSTEMS, PROCEEDINGS+1996::no title+GILLMAN DW+P METANET C VOORB NE+2001::no title+GRAVES R+UN ECE EUR OECD M MA+2003::no title+GYORKI I+UNECE EUR OECD WORK+no time::no title+IMMON W+BUILDING DATA WAREHO+2002::no title+JOHANIS P+UN ECE EUR OECD WORK+2004::no title+JOSHUA D+UN ECE EUR OECD M MA+2005::no title+Kimball, R; Reeves, L.; Ross, M<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Thornthwaite, W</span>.+The Data Warehouse Lifecycle Toolkit: Expert Methods for Designing, Developing and Deploying Data Warehousees+1998::no title+KLEP J+UNECE WORK SESS STAT+1999::no title+MEINTZBERG H+STRUCTURE 5 DESIGNIN+1986::no title+NORDBOTTEN S+P 36 SESS ISI SYDN A+1967::no title+PEDERSEN L+UN ECE EUR OECD M MA+2003::no title+RENSSEN RH+ALIGNING ESTIMATES R+2001::no title+SAMUELSON L+UN ECE EUR OECD M MA+2004::no title+SUNDGREN B+IST199929093 EPROS+2003::no title+SUNDGREN B+SEM MAN STAT INF TEC+1999::no title+VOSSELMAN W+BREAKING DOWN WALLS+1997::no title+WILLEBOORDSE AJ+NEW STAT NETHERLANDS+2000::no title+WILLENBORG L+PLANS ESB+2002::no title+YPMA W+DOORKIJK STAT PROCES+2005::no title+ZEILA K+UNECE EUROSTAT OECD+2004"
A statistical approach to assess referendum results: the Venezuelan recall referendum 2004,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,DEC 2006,5,1,"This article presents a statistical approach to assess the coherence of official results of referendum processes. The statistical analysis described is divided in four phases, according to the methodology used and the corresponding results: (1) Initial Study, (2) Quantification of irregular certificates of election, (3) Identification of irregular voting centers and (4) Estimation of recall referendum results. The technique of cluster analysis is applied to address the issue of heterogeneity of the parishes with respect to their political preferences.

The Venezuelan recall referendum 2004 is the case study we used to apply the proposed methodology, based on the data published by the ""Consejo Nacional Electoral"" (CNE-National Electoral Council). Finally, we present the conclusions of the study which we summarize as follows: The percentage of irregular certificates of election is between 22.2% and 26.5% of the total; 18% of the voting centers show an irregular voting pattern in their certificates of election, the votes corresponding to this irregularity are around 2,550,000; The result estimate, using the unbiased votes as representative of the population for the percentage of YES votes against President Chavez is 56.4% as opposed to the official result of 41%.","cluster analysis,confidence interval,hypothesis testing,recall referendum",,"Cordero, Maria M.

Measure for measure: Exact F tests and the mixed models controversy,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,DEC 2006,19,4,"We consider exact F tests for the hypothesis of null random factor effect in the presence of interaction under the two factor mixed models involved in the mixed models controversy. We show that under the constrained parameter (CP) model, even in unbalanced data situations, MSB/MSE (in the usual ANOVA notation) follows an exact F distribution when the null hypothesis holds. We also obtain an exact F test for what is generally (and erroneously) assumed to be an equivalent hypothesis under the unconstrained parameter (UP) model. For unbalanced data, such a corresponding test statistic does not coincide with MSB/MSAB (the test statistic advocated for balanced data cases). We compute the power of the exact test under different imbalance patterns and show that although the loss of power increases with the degree of imbalance, it still remains reasonable from a practical point of view.","exact test,householder orthogonal transformation,mixed model,random effect,variance components",VARIANCE-COMPONENTS,"Lencina, Viviana B.@Univ Nacl Tucuman, RA-4000 San Miguel De Tucuman, Tucuman, Argentina@Univ Sao Paulo, BR-05508 Sao Paulo, Brazil::Singer, Julio M.@Univ Nacl Tucuman, RA-4000 San Miguel De Tucuman, Tucuman, Argentina@Univ Sao Paulo, BR-05508 Sao Paulo, Brazil","Lencina, Viviana B.@Universidad Nacional de Tucuman@Universidade de Sao Paulo::Singer, Julio M.@Universidad Nacional de Tucuman@Universidade de Sao Paulo","Singer, Julio@C-1232-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6515-9643","Likelihood ratio tests in linear mixed models with one variance component+Crainiceanu, CM; Ruppert, D+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2004::Voss, D.

Estimation in two-stage models with heteroscedasticity,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,DEC 2006,29,6,"A surprising number of important problems can be cast in the framework of estimating a mean and variance using data arising from a two-stage structure. The first stage is a random sampling of ""units"" with some quantity of interest associated with the unit. The second stage produces an estimate of that quantity and usually, but not always, an estimated standard error, which may change considerably across units. Heteroscedasticity in the estimates over different units can arise for a number of reasons, including variation associated with the unit and changing sampling effort over units. This paper presents a broad discussion of the problem of making inferences for the population mean and variance associated with the unobserved true values at the first stage of sampling. A careful discussion of the causes of heteroscedasticity is given, followed by an examination of ways in which inferences can be carried out in a manner that is robust to the nature of the within unit heteroscedasticity. Among the conclusions are that under any type of heteroscedasticity, an unbiased estimate of the mean and the variance of the estimated mean can be obtained by using the estimates as if they were true unobserved values from the first stage. The issue of using the mean versus a weighted average which tries to account for the heteroscedasticity is also discussed. An unbiased estimate of the population variance is given and the variance of this estimate and its covariance with the estimated mean is provided under various types of heteroscedasticity. The two-stage setting arises in many contexts including the one-way random effects models with replication, meta-analysis, multi-stage sampling from finite populations and random coefficients models. We will motivate and illustrate the problem with data arising from these various contexts with the goal of providing a unified framework for addressing such problems.","mean, meta-analysis,measurement error, random coefficients,random effects,replication,sampling,variance","MEASUREMENT ERROR,ROC CURVES,METAANALYSIS,HETEROGENEITY,GROWTH","Buonaccorsi, John@Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA@Univ Oslo, Sect Med Stat, N-0316 Oslo, Norway","Buonaccorsi, John@University of Massachusetts Amherst@University of Massachusetts System@University of Oslo",not exist,"Incorporating variability in estimates of heterogeneity in the random effects model in meta-analysis+Biggerstaff, BJ; Tweedie, RL+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+APR 15 1997::no title+BOHNING D+COMPUTER ASSISTED AN+1999::no title+Casella, G.; Berger, R.

Survey estimates by calibration on complex auxiliary information,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2006.tb00165.x,AUG 2006,30,24,"In the last decade, calibration estimation has developed into an important field of research in survey sampling. Calibration is now an important methodological instrument in the production of statistics. Several national statistical agencies have developed software designed to compute calibrated weights based on auxiliary information available in population registers and other sources.

This paper reviews some recent progress and offers some new perspectives. Calibration estimation can be used to advantage in a range of different survey conditions. This paper examines several situations, including estimation for domains in one-phase sampling, estimation for two-phase sampling, and estimation for two-stage sampling with integrated weighting. Typical of those situations is complex auxiliary information, a term that we use for information made up of several components. An example occurs when a two-stage sample survey has information both for units and for clusters of units, or when estimation for domains relies on information from different parts of the population.

Complex auxiliary information opens up more than one way of computing the final calibrated weights to be used in estimation. They may be computed in a single step or in two or more successive steps. Depending on the approach, the resulting estimates do differ to some degree. All significant parts of the total information should be reflected in the final weights. The effectiveness of the complex information is mirrored by the variance of the resulting calibration estimator. Its exact variance is not presentable in simple form. Close approximation is possible via the corresponding linearized statistic. We define and use automated linearization as a shortcut in finding the linearized statistic. Its variance is easy to state, to interpret and to estimate. The variance components are expressed in terms of residuals, similar to those of standard regression theory. Visual inspection of the residuals reveals how the different components of the complex auxiliary information interact and work together toward reducing the variance.","official statistics production,administrative registers,calibrated weights,design-based inference,automated linearization,integrated weighting,ecological fallacy,domains of interest,two-stage sampling,two-phase sampling",,"Estevao, Victor M.@Stat Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada::Saerndal, Carl-Erik@Stat Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada","Estevao, Victor M.@Statistics Canada::Saerndal, Carl-Erik@Statistics Canada",not exist,"no title+Andersson, C.; Nordberg, L.+A User's Guide to CLAN97+1998::no title+ANDERSSON C+CONTINUOUS LABOUR FO+1997::An optimal calibration distance leading to the optimal regression estimator+Andersson, P.

A simulation approach to nonparametric empirical Bayes analysis,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.2307/1403530,APR 2001,47,2,"We deal with general mixture or hierarchical models of the form m(x) = integral (Theta) f(x \ theta )g(theta )d theta, where g(B) and m(x) are called mixing and mixed or compound densities respectively, and B is called the mixing parameter The usual statistical application of these models emerges when we have data x(i), i = i,..., n with densities f(x(i) \ theta (i)) for given theta (i), and the theta (i) are independent with common density g(B), For a certain well known class of densities f(x \ theta), we present a sample-based approach to reconstruct g(B), We first provide theoretical results and then we use, in an empirical Bayes spirit, the first four moments of the data to estimate the first four moments of g(B).

Simulations which investigate the operating characteristics of our proposed methodology are presented.

Likelihood inference for Gibbs processes in the analysis of spatial paint patterns,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,APR 2001,53,9,"Several authors have proposed stochastic and non-stochastic approximations to the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) for Gibbs point processes in modelling spatial point patterns with pairwise interactions. The approximations are necessary because of the difficulty of evaluating the normalizing constant. In this paper, we first provide a review of methods which yield crude approximations to the MLE. We also review methods based on Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques for which exact MLE has become feasible. We then present a comparative simulation study of the performance of such methods of estimation based on two simulation techniques, the Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, carried out for the Strauss model.","Gibbs point processes,maximum likelihood,Monte Carlo inference,stochastic approximation,Strauss process,triplets process","CARLO MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,MARKOV POINT-PROCESSES,BAYESIAN COMPUTATION,INTERACTION POTENTIALS,DISTRIBUTIONS,CHAINS,MODEL,CONVERGENCE,SIMULATION,SYSTEMS","Mateu, J@Univ Jaume 1, Dept Matemat, E-12071 Castellon de La Plana, Spain@Univ Valencia, Dept Estadist & IO, E-46100 Burjassot, Spain::Montes, F@Univ Jaume 1, Dept Matemat, E-12071 Castellon de La Plana, Spain@Univ Valencia, Dept Estadist & IO, E-46100 Burjassot, Spain","Mateu, J@Universitat Jaume I@University of Valencia::Montes, F@Universitat Jaume I@University of Valencia","Montes, Francisco@K-9919-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1708-9385::Mateu, Jorge@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2868-7604","no title+Allen, M.; Tildesley, D.+Computer Simulation of Liquids+1987::NEAREST-NEIGHBOUR MARKOV POINT-PROCESSES AND RANDOM SETS+BADDELEY, A; MOLLER, J+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+AUG 1989::Stochastic geometry models in high-level vision+Baddeley, A.

Statistical issues in fMRI for brain imaging,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.2307/1403532,APR 2001,36,32,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging is a technique developed in the last decade and used in the fields of cognitive psychology and neuroscience, among others, to study the processes underlying the working of the human brain. In this paper we examine some of the statistical issues in functional magnetic resonance imaging for brain research. We start by giving a brief introduction to the physics of magnetic resonance imaging. Using a psychological experiment as a case study, we then describe questions of design and statistical analysis. The data obtained from functional magnetic resonance imaging studies are of a highly complex nature, displaying both spatial and temporal correlation, as well as high levels of noise from different sources. Given this, the scope for statistics is vast, and is not limited to simple analysis of the data, once collected.","correlated data,functional neuroimaging,human brain mapping","SENSORY STIMULATION,RESONANCE,ACTIVATION,TIME,VISUALIZATION,OXYGENATION,SOFTWARE,DESIGN,BLOOD,SETS","Lazar, NA@Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Stat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA@Pittsburgh Supercomp Ctr, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA::Eddy, WF@Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Stat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA@Pittsburgh Supercomp Ctr, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA::Genovese, CR@Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Stat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA@Pittsburgh Supercomp Ctr, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA::Welling, J@Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Stat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA@Pittsburgh Supercomp Ctr, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA","Lazar, NA@Carnegie Mellon University@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@University of Pittsburgh::Eddy, WF@Carnegie Mellon University@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@University of Pittsburgh::Genovese, CR@Carnegie Mellon University@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@University of Pittsburgh::Welling, J@Carnegie Mellon University@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@University of Pittsburgh",not exist,"no title+ADLER RJ+GEOMETRY RANDOM+1981::PROCESSING STRATEGIES FOR TIME-COURSE DATA SETS IN FUNCTIONAL MRI OF THE HUMAN BRAIN+BANDETTINI, PA; JESMANOWICZ, A; WONG, EC; et al.+MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE+AUG 1993::no title+Brown, M A; Semelka, R C.+MRI: Basic principles and applications+1995::AFNI: Software for analysis and visualization of functional magnetic resonance neuroimages+Cox, RW+COMPUTERS AND BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH+JUN 1996::Software tools for analysis and visualization of fMRI data+Cox, RW; Hyde, JS+NMR IN BIOMEDICINE+JUN-AUG 1997::Functional imaging analysis software-computational Olio+Eddy, W.F.; Fitzgerald, M.; Genovese, C.; et al.+COMPSTAT.

Since it is almost impossible to describe the response to these noise inputs precisely, for automatic processing of seismic data, proper statistical modeling is necessary. In this paper, we describe four specific examples of time series modeling for signal extraction problems related to seismology, Namely, we consider 1) the estimation of the arrival time of a seismic signal, 2) the extraction of small seismic signal from noisy data, 3) the detection of the coseismic effect in groundwater level data contaminated by various effects from air pressure etc., and 4) the estimation of changing spectral characteristic of seismic record.","state space model,arrival time,seismic wave,ground water level,outliers, coseismic effect,time-varying spectrum","COVARIANCE TIME-SERIES,MODEL","Kitagawa, G@Inst Stat Math, Minato Ku, Tokyo 106569, Japan@Hokkaido Univ, Inst Seismol & Volcanol, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan@Geol Survey Japan, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058567, Japan::Takanami, T@Inst Stat Math, Minato Ku, Tokyo 106569, Japan@Hokkaido Univ, Inst Seismol & Volcanol, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan@Geol Survey Japan, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058567, Japan::Matsumoto, N@Inst Stat Math, Minato Ku, Tokyo 106569, Japan@Hokkaido Univ, Inst Seismol & Volcanol, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan@Geol Survey Japan, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058567, Japan","Kitagawa, G@Institute of Statistical Mathematics (ISM)@Research Organization of Information & Systems (ROIS)@Hokkaido University@National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science & Technology (AIST)::Takanami, T@Institute of Statistical Mathematics (ISM)@Research Organization of Information & Systems (ROIS)@Hokkaido University@National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science & Technology (AIST)::Matsumoto, N@Institute of Statistical Mathematics (ISM)@Research Organization of Information & Systems (ROIS)@Hokkaido University@National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science & Technology (AIST)","Matsumoto, Norio@M-4942-2018@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7021-1773::Kitagawa, Genshiro@F-9460-2012","BAYESIAN EXTENSION OF THE MINIMUM AIC PROCEDURE OF AUTOREGRESSIVE MODEL FITTING+AKAIKE, H+BIOMETRIKA+1979::no title+AKAIKE H+COMPUTER SCI MONOGRA+1985::no title+no author+The practice of time series analysis+1998::Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principle+Akaike, H.+2 INT S INF THEOR AK+1998::no title+Anderson, B.

Optimal Adaptive Designs with Inverse Ordinary Differential Equations,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12233,AUG 2018,34,0,"Many industrial and engineering applications are built on the basis of differential equations. In some cases, parameters of these equations are not known and are estimated from measurements leading to an inverse problem. Unlike many other papers, we suggest to construct new designs in the adaptive fashion on the go' using the A-optimality criterion. This approach is demonstrated on determination of optimal locations of measurements and temperature sensors in several engineering applications: (1) determination of the optimal location to measure the height of a hanging wire in order to estimate the sagging parameter with minimum variance (toy example), (2) adaptive determination of optimal locations of temperature sensors in a one-dimensional inverse heat transfer problem and (3) adaptive design in the framework of a one-dimensional diffusion problem when the solution is found numerically using the finite difference approach. In all these problems, statistical criteria for parameter identification and optimal design of experiments are applied. Statistical simulations confirm that estimates derived from the adaptive optimal design converge to the true parameter values with minimum sum of variances when the number of measurements increases. We deliberately chose technically uncomplicated industrial problems to transparently introduce principal ideas of statistical adaptive design.","Diffusion equation,heat equation,non-linear least squares,optimal design of experiments,inverse problem",PARAMETER-IDENTIFICATION,"Demidenko, Eugene@Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biomed Data Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA@Dartmouth Coll, Dept Math, Hanover, NH 03755 USA","Demidenko, Eugene@Dartmouth College",not exist,"no title+Abadir,, K.M.; Magnus,, J.R.+Matrix Algebra.+2005::no title+Alifanov, OM.+Inverse heat transfer problems+1994::Parameter Estimation and Inverse Problems+Aster, RC; Borchers, B; Thurber, CH+PARAMETER ESTIMATION AND INVERSE PROBLEMS+2005::no title+Atkinson, A.

Missing Data: A Unified Taxonomy Guided by Conditional Independence,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12242,AUG 2018,27,0,"Recent work (Seaman et al., ; Mealli & Rubin, ) attempts to clarify the not always well-understood difference between realised and everywhere definitions of missing at random (MAR) and missing completely at random. Another branch of the literature (Mohan et al., ; Pearl & Mohan, ) exploits always-observed covariates to give variable-based definitions of MAR and missing completely at random. In this paper, we develop a unified taxonomy encompassing all approaches. In this taxonomy, the new concept of complementary MAR' is introduced, and its relationship with the concept of data observed at random is discussed. All relationships among these definitions are analysed and represented graphically. Conditional independence, both at the random variable and at the event level, is the formal language we adopt to connect all these definitions. Our paper covers both the univariate and the multivariate case, where attention is paid to monotone missingness and to the concept of sequential MAR. Specifically, for monotone missingness, we propose a sequential MAR definition that might be more appropriate than both everywhere and variable-based MAR to model dropout in certain contexts.","conditional independence,dropout,missing data,taxonomy","PATTERN-MIXTURE MODELS,DROP-OUT,IGNORABILITY","Doretti, Marco@Univ Perugia, Dept Polit Sci, I-06123 Perugia, Italy::Geneletti, Sara@London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Stat, London WC2A 2AE, England::Stanghellini, Elena@Univ Perugia, Dept Econ, I-06123 Perugia, Italy","Doretti, Marco@University of Perugia::Geneletti, Sara@London School Economics & Political Science@University of London::Stanghellini, Elena@University of Perugia",not exist,"Using causal diagrams to guide analysis in missing data problems+Daniel, Rhian M.; Kenward, Michael G.; Cousens, Simon N.; et al.+STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH+JUN 2012::CONDITIONAL INDEPENDENCE IN STATISTICAL-THEORY+DAWID, AP+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1979::Ignorability for general longitudinal data+Farewell, D.

The Use of Prior Information in Very Robust Regression for Fraud Detection,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12247,AUG 2018,18,0,"Misinvoicing is a major tool in fraud including money laundering. We develop a method of detecting the patterns of outliers that indicate systematic mis-pricing. As the data only become available year by year, we develop a combination of very robust regression and the use of cleaned' prior information from earlier years, which leads to early and sharp indication of potentially fraudulent activity that can be passed to legal agencies to institute prosecution. As an example, we use yearly imports of a specific seafood into the European Union. This is only one of over one million annual data sets, each of which can currently potentially contain 336 observations. We provide a solution to the resulting big data problem, which requires analysis with the minimum of human intervention.","big data,data cleaning,forward search,MM estimation,misinvoicing,money laundering,seafood,timeliness",MULTIVARIATE OUTLIERS,"Riani, Marco@Univ Parma, Dept Econ & Management, Parma, Italy::Corbellini, Aldo@Univ Parma, Dept Econ & Management, Parma, Italy::Atkinson, Anthony C.@London Sch Econ, Dept Stat, London WC2A 2AE, England","Riani, Marco@University of Parma::Corbellini, Aldo@University of Parma::Atkinson, Anthony C.@London School Economics & Political Science@University of London",not exist,"wle: a package for robust statistics using weighted likelihood+Agostinelli,, C.+R News+2001::A weighted strategy to handle likelihood uncertainty in Bayesian inference+Agostinelli, Claudio; Greco, Luca+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS+FEB 2013::Uncontained+[Anonymous].+Economist+2014::no title+Atkinson, A.

Estimating Precision and Recall for Deterministic and Probabilistic Record Linkage,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12246,AUG 2018,22,0,"Linking administrative, survey and census files to enhance dimensions such as time and breadth or depth of detail is now common. Because a unique person identifier is often not available, records belonging to two different units (e.g. people) may be incorrectly linked. Estimating the proportion of links that are correct, called Precision, is difficult because, even after clerical review, there will remain uncertainty about whether a link is in fact correct or incorrect. Measures of Precision are useful when deciding whether or not it is worthwhile linking two files, when comparing alternative linking strategies and as a quality measure for estimates based on the linked file. This paper proposes an estimator of Precision for a linked file that has been created by either deterministic (or rules-based) or probabilistic (where evidence for a link being a match is weighted against the evidence that it is not a match) linkage, both of which are widely used in practice. This paper shows that the proposed estimators perform well.","Latent models,link quality",REGRESSION,"Chipperfield, James@Australian Bur Stat, Docklands, Vic 3008, Australia@Univ Wollongong, Natl Inst Appl Stat Res Australia, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia::Hansen, Noel@Australian Bur Stat, Docklands, Vic 3008, Australia::Rossiter, Peter@Australian Bur Stat, Docklands, Vic 3008, Australia","Chipperfield, James@University of Wollongong::Hansen, Noel@Unknow::Rossiter, Peter@Unknow",not exist,"no title+no author+Australian Standard Geographical Classification+2011::Death Registrations to Census Linkage Project -Methodology and Quality Assessment+no author+Information paper: Australian Bureau of Statistics, 3302. 0. 55. 004+2013::Probabilistic record linkage and a method to calculate the positive predictive value+Blakely, T; Salmond, C+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+DEC 2002::Inference based on estimating equations and probability-linked data+Chambers,, R.; Chipperfield,, J.; Davis,, W.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Kovacevic,, M</span>.+Working Paper+2009::Using the Bootstrap to Account for Linkage Errors when Analysing Probabilistically Linked Categorical Data+Chipperfield, James O.; Chambers, Raymond L.+JOURNAL OF OFFICIAL STATISTICS+SEP 2015::Maximum likelihood estimation for contingency tables and logistic regression with incorrectly linked data+Chipperfield, James O.; Bishop, Glenys R.; Campbell, Paul+SURVEY METHODOLOGY+JUN 2011::no title+Christen,, P.+Data Matching+2012::no title+Christen,, P.; Churches,, T.+FebrlFreely Extensible Biomedical Record Linkage, Release 0.3.1+2005::A THEORY FOR RECORD LINKAGE+FELLEGI, IP; SUNTER, AB+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1969::no title+Harron,, K.; Goldstein,, H.; Dibben, C.+Methodological Developments in Data linkage+2014::Evaluating bias due to data linkage error in electronic healthcare records+Harron, Katie; Wade, Angie; Gilbert, Ruth; et al.+BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY+MAR 5 2014::no title+Herzog, T.

Towards a Routine External Evaluation Protocol for Small Area Estimation,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12248,AUG 2018,24,0,"Statistical criteria are needed by which to evaluate the potential success or failure of applications of small area estimation. A necessary step to achieve this is a protocola series of stepsby which to assess whether an instance of small area estimation has given satisfactory results or not. Most customary attempts at evaluation of small area techniques have deficiencies. Often, evaluation is not attempted. Every small area study requires an external evaluation. With proper planning, this can be routinely achieved, although at some cost, amounting to some sacrifice of efficiency of global estimates. We propose a Routine External Evaluation Protocol to allow us to judge whether, in a given survey, small area estimation has led to accurate results and sound inference.","bias,confidence interval,coverage,mean square error,mean square error estimate","DOMAINS,ERROR,MODEL","Dorfman, Alan H.@Unknow","Dorfman, Alan H.@Unknow",not exist,"no title+[Anonymous].+SMALL AREA ESTIMATIO+2015::Examining sensitivity of small area inferences to uncertainty about sample error variances+Bell,, W.R.+P SECT SURV RES METH+2008::Application of hierarchical Bayesian nodels with poststratification for small-area estimation from complex survey data+Beresovsky,, V.; Burt,, C.W.; Parsons,, V.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Schenker,, N.; Mutter,, R</span>.+P SECT SURV RES METH+2011::Evaluation of small area estimation methodsan application to unemployment estimates from the UK LFS+Brown,, G.; Chambers,, R.; Heady,, P.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Heasman,, D</span>.+P STAT CAN S+2001::no title+Cochran, WG.+Sampling techniques+1977::On measuring the variability of small area estimators under a basic area level model+Datta, GS; Rao, JNK; Smith, DD+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 2005::A balanced sampling approach for multi-way stratification designs for small area estimation+Falorsi, Piero Demetrio; Righi, Paolo+SURVEY METHODOLOGY+DEC 2008::ESTIMATES OF INCOME FOR SMALL PLACES - APPLICATION OF JAMES-STEIN PROCEDURES TO CENSUS-DATA+FAY, RE; HERRIOT, RA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1979::Variance modeling in the U.S. small area income and poverty estimates program for the American community survey+Hawala,, S.; Lahiri,, P.+P SECT SURV RES METH+2010::ROBUST ESTIMATION OF MEAN SQUARED ERROR OF SMALL-AREA ESTIMATORS+LAHIRI, P; RAO, JNK+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1995::Sample size calculation for small- area estimation+Longford, NT.+Surv Methodol.+2006::Prediction Error of Small Area Predictors Shrinking Both Means and Variances+Maiti, Tapabrata; Ren, Hao; Sinha, Samiran+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+SEP 2014::Producing small area estimates from national surveys: methods for minimizing use of indirect estimators+Marker,, D.A.+Surv.

Measuring Identification Risk in Microdata Release and Its Control by Post-randomisation,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12252,AUG 2018,27,0,"Statistical agencies often release a masked or perturbed version of survey data to protect the confidentiality of respondents' information. Ideally, a perturbation procedure should provide confidentiality protection without much loss of data quality, so that the released data may practically be treated as original data for making inferences. One major objective is to control the risk of correctly identifying any respondent's records in released data, by matching the values of some identifying or key variables. For categorical key variables, we propose a new approach to measuring identification risk and setting strict disclosure control goals. The general idea is to ensure that the probability of correctly identifying any respondent or surveyed unit is at most , which is pre-specified. Then, we develop an unbiased post-randomisation procedure that achieves this goal for >1/3. The procedure allows substantial control over possible changes to the original data, and the variance it induces is of a lower order of magnitude than sampling variance. We apply the procedure to a real data set, where it performs consistently with the theoretical results and quite importantly, shows very little data quality loss.","Correct match probability,data partitioning,data utility,transition probability matrix,unbiased post-randomisation","DISCLOSURE LIMITATION,MISCLASSIFICATION,UTILITY","Nayak, Tapan K.@US Census Bur, Ctr Disclosure Avoidance Res, Washington, DC 20233 USA@George Washington Univ, Dept Stat, Washington, DC 20052 USA::Zhang, Cheng@George Washington Univ, Dept Stat, Washington, DC 20052 USA::You, Jiashen@US Dept Transportat, Bur Transportat Stat, Washington, DC 20590 USA","Nayak, Tapan K.@George Washington University::Zhang, Cheng@George Washington University::You, Jiashen@Unknow",not exist,"DISCLOSURE CONTROL OF MICRODATA+BETHLEHEM, JG; KELLER, WJ; PANNEKOEK, J+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1990::no title+Chaudhuri, A.; Mukerjee, R.+Randomized Response : Theory and Techniques+1988::Estimation of identifi- cation disclosure risk in microdata+Chen, G; Keller -McNulty, S.+J Off Stat.+1998::Risk-Utility Paradigms for Statistical Disclosure Limitation: How to Think, But Not How to Act+Cox, Lawrence H.; Karr, Alan F.; Kinney, Satkartar K.+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+AUG 2011::The analysis of randomized response sum score variables+Cruyff, Maarten J.

Comparing Inference Methods for Non-probability Samples,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12253,AUG 2018,89,0,"Social and economic scientists are tempted to use emerging data sources like big data to compile information about finite populations as an alternative for traditional survey samples. These data sources generally cover an unknown part of the population of interest. Simply assuming that analyses made on these data are applicable to larger populations is wrong. The mere volume of data provides no guarantee for valid inference. Tackling this problem with methods originally developed for probability sampling is possible but shown here to be limited. A wider range of model-based predictive inference methods proposed in the literature are reviewed and evaluated in a simulation study using real-world data on annual mileages by vehicles. We propose to extend this predictive inference framework with machine learning methods for inference from samples that are generated through mechanisms other than random sampling from a target population. Describing economies and societies using sensor data, internet search data, social media and voluntary opt-in panels is cost-effective and timely compared with traditional surveys but requires an extended inference framework as proposed in this article.","Algorithmic inference,big data,predictive modelling,pseudo-design-based estimation","DESIGN-BASED ANALYSIS,BIG DATA,WEB SURVEYS,OFFICIAL STATISTICS,PROPENSITY SCORE,POPULATIONS,ESTIMATORS,REGRESSION,SELECTION","Buelens, Bart@Stat Netherlands, POB 4481, NL-6401 CZ Heerlen, Netherlands::Burger, Joep@Stat Netherlands, POB 4481, NL-6401 CZ Heerlen, Netherlands::van den Brakel, Jan A.@Stat Netherlands, POB 4481, NL-6401 CZ Heerlen, Netherlands@Maastricht Univ, Sch Business & Econ, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands","Buelens, Bart@Unknow::Burger, Joep@Unknow::van den Brakel, Jan A.@Maastricht University",not exist,"Large sample properties of matching estimators for average treatment effects+Abadie, A; Imbens, GW+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 2006::ff: memory-efficient storage of large data on disk and fast access functions+Adler, D.+R package+2014::Summary report of the AAPOR Task Force on non-probability sampling+Baker, R; Brick, JM; Bates, NA.+J Suvery State Methodol+2013::Research Synthesis+Baker, Reg; Blumberg, Stephen J.; Brick, J.

Modeling Temporally Evolving and Spatially Globally Dependent Data,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12266,AUG 2018,127,0,"The last decades have seen an unprecedented increase in the availability of data sets that are inherently global and temporally evolving, from remotely sensed networks to climate model ensembles. This paper provides an overview of statistical modeling techniques for space-time processes, where space is the sphere representing our planet. In particular, we make a distintion between (a) second order-based approaches and (b) practical approaches to modeling temporally evolving global processes. The former approaches are based on the specification of a class of space-time covariance functions, with space being the two-dimensional sphere. The latter are based on explicit description of the dynamics of the space-time process, that is, by specifying its evolution as a function of its past history with added spatially dependent noise. We focus primarily on approach (a), for which the literature has been sparse. We provide new models of space-time covariance functions for random fields defined on spheres cross time. Practical approaches (b) are also discussed, with special emphasis on models built directly on the sphere, without projecting spherical coordinates onto the plane. We present a case study focused on the analysis of air pollution from the 2015 wildfires in Equatorial Asia, an event that was classified as the year's worst environmental disaster. The paper finishes with a list of the main theoretical and applied research problems in the area, where we expect the statistical community to engage over the next decade.","Covariance functions,great circle,massive data sets,spheres","POSITIVE-DEFINITE FUNCTIONS,SPACE-TIME DATA,STATIONARY COVARIANCE FUNCTIONS,MARKOV RANDOM-FIELDS,SPATIOTEMPORAL DATA,CHARACTERIZATION THEOREMS,STOCHASTIC-PROCESSES,POPULATION EXPOSURE,HOMOGENEOUS SPACES,BROWNIAN-MOTION","Porcu, Emilio@Univ Newcastle, Sch Math Stat & Phys, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England@Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Dept Math, Valparaiso 2360102, Chile::Alegria, Alfredo@Univ Newcastle, Sch Math Stat & Phys, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England::Furrer, Reinhard@Univ Zurich, Dept Math, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland@Univ Zurich, Dept Computat Sci, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","Porcu, Emilio@Newcastle University - UK@Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria::Alegria, Alfredo@Newcastle University - UK::Furrer, Reinhard@University of Zurich","Furrer, Reinhard@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6319-2332","Space-time models for moving fields with an application to significant wave height fields+Ailliot, Pierre; Baxevani, Anastassia; Cuzol, Anne; et al.+ENVIRONMETRICS+MAY 2011::Covariance Functions for Multivariate Gaussian Fields Evolving Temporally over Planet Earth+Alegria,, A.; Porcu,, E.; Furrer,, R.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Mateu,, J</span>.+Technical Report+2017::Space-Time Geostatistical Models with both Linear and Seasonal Structures in the Temporal Components+Alegria,, A.; Porcu,, E.+Technical Report+2016::The dimple problem related to space-time modeling under the Lagrangian framework+Alegria, Alfredo; Porcu, Emilio+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+NOV 2017::Multivariate and multiradial Schoenberg measures with their dimension walks+Alonso-Malaver, C.

Ecological Fallacy and Covariates: New Insights based on Multilevel Modelling of Individual Data,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12244,APR 2018,28,0,"The paper provides a new and more explicit formulation of the assumptions needed by the ordinary ecological regression to provide unbiased estimates and clarifies why violations of these assumptions will affect any method of ecological inference. Empirical evidence is obtained by showing that estimates provided by three main ecological inference methods are heavily biased when compared with multilevel logistic regression applied to a unique set of individual data on voting behaviour. The main findings of our paper have two important implications that can be extended to all situations where the assumptions needed to apply ecological inference are violated in the data: (i) only ecological inference methods that allow one to model the effect of covariates have a chance to produce unbiased estimates, and (ii) there are certain data generating mechanisms producing a kind of bias in ecological estimates that cannot be corrected by modelling the effect of covariates.","Ecological inference,voting behaviour,logistic regression,multilevel models","POLITICAL-CULTURE,AGGREGATE DATA,INFERENCE,RENAISSANCE","Gnaldi, Michela@Univ Perugia, Dept Polit Sci, Perugia, Italy::Tomaselli, Venera@Univ Catania, Dept Polit & Social Sci, Catania, Italy::Forcina, Antonio@Univ Perugia, Dept Econ, Perugia, Italy","Gnaldi, Michela@University of Perugia::Tomaselli, Venera@University of Catania::Forcina, Antonio@University of Perugia",not exist,"AGGREGATE DATA, ECOLOGICAL REGRESSION, AND VOTING TRANSITIONS+BROWN, PJ; PAYNE, CD+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1986::EVALUATION OF METHODS FOR ECOLOGICAL INFERENCE+CLEAVE, N; BROWN, PJ; PAYNE, CD+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1995::RULE FOR INFERRING INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL RELATIONSHIPS FROM AGGREGATE DATA+FIREBAUGH, G+AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW+1978::A revised Brown and Payne model of voting behaviour applied to the 2009 elections in Italy+Forcina, A.; Gnaldi, M.; Bracalente, B.+STATISTICAL METHODS AND APPLICATIONS+MAR 2012::A Solution to the Ecological Inference Problem+Freedman, David A.; Klein, S.

Bayesian Model Averaging: A Systematic Review and Conceptual Classification,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12243,APR 2018,86,2,"Bayesian model averaging (BMA) provides a coherent and systematic mechanism for accounting for model uncertainty. It can be regarded as an direct application of Bayesian inference to the problem of model selection, combined estimation and prediction. BMA produces a straightforward model choice criterion and less risky predictions. However, the application of BMA is not always straightforward, leading to diverse assumptions and situational choices on its different aspects. Despite the widespread application of BMA in the literature, there were not many accounts of these differences and trends besides a few landmark revisions in the late 1990s and early 2000s, therefore not accounting for advancements made in the last decades. In this work, we present an account of these developments through a careful content analysis of 820 articles in BMA published between 1996 and 2016. We also develop a conceptual classification scheme to better describe this vast literature, understand its trends and future directions and provide guidance for the researcher interested in both the application and development of the methodology. The results of the classification scheme and content review are then used to discuss the present and future of the BMA literature.","Bayesian model averaging,systematic review,conceptual classification scheme,qualitative content analysis","VARIABLE SELECTION,GRAPHICAL MODELS,GENE SELECTION,UNCERTAINTY,PREDICTION,REGRESSION,APPROXIMATION,DISTRIBUTIONS,ASSOCIATION,PERFORMANCE","Fragoso, Tiago M.@Fundacao CESGRANRIO, Rua Santa Alexandrina 1011, BR-20261903 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil::Bertoli, Wesley@Univ Tecnol Fed Parana, Dept Acad Matemat, Ave Sete Setembro 3165, BR-80230901 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil::Louzada, Francisco@Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Ciencias Matemat & Comp, Ave Trabalhador Sao Carlense, BR-13566590 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil","Fragoso, Tiago M.@Unknow::Bertoli, Wesley@Universidade Tecnologica Federal do Parana::Louzada, Francisco@Universidade de Sao Paulo","Louzada, Francisco@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7815-9554","Iterative Bayesian Model Averaging: a method for the application of survival analysis to high-dimensional microarray data+Annest, Amalia; Bumgarner, Roger E.; Raftery, Adrian E.; et al.+BMC BIOINFORMATICS+FEB 26 2009::Capture Recapture Estimation Using Finite Mixtures of Arbitrary Dimension+Arnold, Richard; Hayakawa, Yu; Yip, Paul+BIOMETRICS+JUN 2010::Bayesian Variable Selection for Probit Mixed Models Applied to Gene Selection+Baragatti, Meli+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2011::Modelling map positional error to infer true feature location+Barber, Jarrett J.; Gelfand, Alan E.; Silander, John A., Jr.+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+DEC 2006::Understanding the cell phone effect on vehicle fatalities: a Bayesian view+Blattenberger, Gail; Fowles, Richard; Loeb, Peter D.; et al.+APPLIED ECONOMICS+2012::Genomic predictions in Angus cattle: Comparisons of sample size, response variables, and clustering methods for cross-validation+Boddhireddy, P.; Kelly, M.

Online Principal Component Analysis in High Dimension: Which Algorithm to Choose?,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12220,APR 2018,47,1,"Principal component analysis (PCA) is a method of choice for dimension reduction. In the current context of data explosion, online techniques that do not require storing all data in memory are indispensable to perform the PCA of streaming data and/or massive data. Despite the wide availability of recursive algorithms that can efficiently update the PCA when new data are observed, the literature offers little guidance on how to select a suitable algorithm for a given application. This paper reviews the main approaches to online PCA, namely, perturbation techniques, incremental methods and stochastic optimisation, and compares the most widely employed techniques in terms statistical accuracy, computation time and memory requirements using artificial and real data. Extensions of online PCA to missing data and to functional data are detailed. All studied algorithms are available in the package onlinePCA on CRAN.","Eigenvalue decomposition,perturbation methods,stochastic gradient,generalised Hebbian algorithm,incremental SVD","RANK-ONE MODIFICATION,STOCHASTIC-APPROXIMATION,PCA,MATRIX,EIGENPROBLEM,CONVERGENCE,RECOGNITION","Cardot, Herve@Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Inst Math Bourgogne, 9 Ave A Savary, F-21078 Dijon, France::Degras, David@Univ Massachusetts Boston, Dept Math, 100 William T Morrissey Blvd, Boston, MA 02125 USA","Cardot, Herve@Universite de Bourgogne@Universite Bourgogne Franche-Comte (ComUE)::Degras, David@University of Massachusetts Boston@University of Massachusetts System","Cardot, Herve@B-6217-2009@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5537-4494","Stochastic Optimization for PCA and PLS+Arora, Raman; Cotter, Andrew; Livescu, Karen; et al.+2012 50TH ANNUAL ALLERTON CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATION, CONTROL, AND COMPUTING (ALLERTON)+2012::no title+Ash, R.B.; Gardner, M.F.+TOPICS STOCHASTIC PR+1975::Low-Rank Incremental methods for computing dominant singular subspaces+Baker, C.

Simplified Jackknife Variance Estimates for Fuzzy Measures of Multidimensional Poverty,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12219,APR 2018,50,0,"In this paper, we present a practical methodology for variance estimation for multi-dimensional measures of poverty and deprivation of households and individuals, derived from sample surveys with complex designs and fairly large sample sizes. The measures considered are based on fuzzy representation of individuals' propensity to deprivation in monetary and diverse non-monetary dimensions. We believe this to be the first original contribution for estimating standard errors for such fuzzy poverty measures. The second objective is to describe and numerically illustrate computational procedures and difficulties in producing reliable and robust estimates of sampling error for such complex statistics. We attempt to identify some of these problems and provide solutions in the context of actual situations. A detailed application based on European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions data for 19 NUTS2 regions in Spain is provided.","variance estimation,resampling methods,Jackknife repeated replication,multi-dimensional deprivation,fuzzy poverty measures","QUALITY-OF-LIFE,RELATIVE POVERTY,COMPLEX SURVEYS,EU-SILC,INDICATORS,DEPRIVATION,LINEARIZATION,PERSPECTIVE,STATISTICS,INCOME","Betti, Gianni@Univ Siena, Dipartimento Econ Polit & Stat, Siena, Italy::Gagliardi, Francesca@Univ Siena, Dipartimento Econ Polit & Stat, Siena, Italy::Verma, Vijay@Univ Siena, Dipartimento Econ Polit & Stat, Siena, Italy","Betti, Gianni@University of Siena::Gagliardi, Francesca@University of Siena::Verma, Vijay@University of Siena","Betti, Gianni@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0414-7806","Marital disruption and economic well-being: a comparative analysis+Aassve, Arnstein; Betti, Gianni; Mazzuco, Stefano; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+2007::Marital disruption and economic well-being: poverty, income and lifestyle deprivation+Aassve, Arnstein; Betti, Gianni; Mazzuco, Stefano; et al.+WHEN MARRIAGE ENDS: ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES OF PARTNERSHIP DISSOLUTION+2009::Counting and multidimensional poverty measurement+Alkire, S.; Foster, J.+Journal of Public Economics+2011::Variance Estimation of Change in Poverty Rates: an Application to the Turkish EU-SILC Survey+Alper, Melike Oguz; Berger, Yves G.+JOURNAL OF OFFICIAL STATISTICS+JUN 2015::Unidimensional and multidimensional fuzzy poverty measures: New approach+Belhadj, Besma; Limam, Mohamed+ECONOMIC MODELLING+JUL 2012::New weighting scheme for the dimensions in multidimensional poverty indices+Belhadj, Besma+ECONOMICS LETTERS+SEP 2012::A new fuzzy unidimensional poverty index from an information theory perspective+Belhadj, Besma+EMPIRICAL ECONOMICS+MAY 2011::A simple variance estimator of change for rotating repeated surveys: an application to the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions household surveys+Berger, Y.

Stratification of Skewed Populations: A Comparison of Optimisation-based versus Approximate Methods,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12230,APR 2018,42,0,"Survey statisticians use either approximate or optimisation-based methods to stratify finite populations. Examples of the former are the cumrootf (Dalenius & Hodges, ) and geometric (Gunning & Horgan, ) methods, while examples of the latter are Sethi () and Kozak () algorithms. The approximate procedures result in inflexible stratum boundaries; this lack of flexibility results in non-optimal boundaries. On the other hand, optimisation-based methods provide stratum boundaries that can simultaneously account for (i) a chosen allocation scheme, (ii) overall sample size or required reliability of the estimator of a studied parameter and (iii) presence or absence of a take-all stratum. Given these additional conditions, optimisation-based methods will result in optimal boundaries. The only disadvantage of these methods is their complexity. However, in the second decade of 21st century, this complexity does not actually pose a problem. We illustrate how these two groups of methods differ by comparing their efficiency for two artificial populations and a real population. Our final point is that statistical offices should prefer optimisation-based over approximate stratification methods; such a decision will help them either save much public money or, if funds are already allocated to a survey, result in more precise estimates of national statistics.","cumrootf method,geometric stratification,Kozak algorithm,Lavallee-Hidiroglou algorithm,numerical optimisation,sample allocation,Sethi algorithm","UNIVARIATE STRATIFICATION,OPTIMUM STRATIFICATION,SAMPLE-SIZES,STRATUM BOUNDARIES,GENETIC ALGORITHM,BUSINESS SURVEYS,SURVEY DESIGN,CONSTRUCTION,LAVALLEE,PACKAGE","Hidiroglou, Michael A.@Stat Canada, Business Survey Methods, Ottawa, ON, Canada::Kozak, Marcin@Univ Informat Technol & Management Rzeszow, Dept Quantitat & Qualitat Methods, Rzeszow, Poland","Hidiroglou, Michael A.@Statistics Canada::Kozak, Marcin@University of Information Technology & Management Rzeszow",not exist,"A General Algorithm for Univariate Stratification+Baillargeon, Sophie; Rivest, Louis-Paul+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+DEC 2009::The construction of stratified designs in R with the package stratification+Baillargeon, Sophie; Rivest, Louis-Paul+SURVEY METHODOLOGY+JUN 2011::Joint determination of optimal stratification and sample allocation using genetic algorithm+Ballin, Marco; Barcaroli, Giulio+SURVEY METHODOLOGY+DEC 2013::POWER ALLOCATIONS - DETERMINING SAMPLE SIZES FOR SUBNATIONAL AREAS+BANKIER, MD+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 1988::SamplingStrata: An R Package for the Optimization of Stratified Sampling+Barcaroli, Giulio+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL SOFTWARE+OCT 2014::A Framework for Cut-off Sampling in Business Survey Design+Benedetti, Roberto; Bee, Marco; Espa, Giuseppe+JOURNAL OF OFFICIAL STATISTICS+DEC 2010::A tree-based approach to forming strata in multipurpose business surveys+Benedetti, Roberto; Espa, Giuseppe; Lafratta, Giovanni+SURVEY METHODOLOGY+DEC 2008::An iterative local search approach applied to the optimal stratification problem+Brito, Jose; Ochi, Luiz; Montenegro, Flavio; et al.+INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS IN OPERATIONAL RESEARCH+NOV 2010::COMPARISON OF METHODS FOR DETERMINING STRATUM BOUNDARIES+COCHRAN, WG+BULLETIN OF THE INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL INSTITUTE+1961::MINIMUM VARIANCE STRATIFICATION+DALENIUS, T; HODGES, JL+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1959::The choice of stratification points+Dalenius, T.; Hodges, J.

What Does Objective Mean in a Dirichlet-multinomial Process?,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12231,APR 2018,37,0,"The Dirichlet-multinomial process can be seen as the generalisation of the binomial model with beta prior distribution when the number of categories is larger than two. In such a scenario, setting informative prior distributions when the number of categories is great becomes difficult, so the need for an objective approach arises. However, what does objective mean in the Dirichlet-multinomial process? To deal with this question, we study the sensitivity of the posterior distribution to the choice of an objective Dirichlet prior from those presented in the available literature. We illustrate the impact of the selection of the prior distribution in several scenarios and discuss the most sensible ones.","Bayesian inference,non-informative priors,posterior mean","CONTINGENCY-TABLES,BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS,DISTRIBUTIONS,INFERENCE,PRIORS,PARAMETERS,MIXTURES","Alvares, Danilo@Univ Valencia, Valencia, Spain::Armero, Carmen@Univ Valencia, Valencia, Spain::Forte, Anabel@Univ Valencia, Valencia, Spain","Alvares, Danilo@University of Valencia::Armero, Carmen@University of Valencia::Forte, Anabel@University of Valencia",not exist,"no title+Agresti,, A.+Categorical data analysis+2013::MIXTURES OF DIRICHLET DISTRIBUTIONS AND ESTIMATION IN CONTINGENCY-TABLES+ALBERT, JH; GUPTA, AK+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1982::Exploring Bayesian models to evaluate control procedures for plant disease+Alvares, Danilo; Armero, Carmen; Fortes, Anabel; et al.+SORT-STATISTICS AND OPERATIONS RESEARCH TRANSACTIONS+JAN-JUN 2016::The interplay of Bayesian and frequentist analysis+Bayarri, MJ; Berger, JO+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+FEB 2004::An essay toward solving a problem in the doctrine of chances+Bayes, T.+Philos T R Soc Lond+1763::The Case for Objective Bayesian Analysis+Berger, James+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2006::Overall Objective Priors+Berger, James O.; Bernardo, Jose M.; Sun, Dongchu+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+MAR 2015::ORDERED GROUP REFERENCE PRIORS WITH APPLICATION TO THE MULTINOMIAL PROBLEM+BERGER, JO; BERNARDO, JM+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1992::An introduction to the imprecise Dirichlet model for multinomial data+Bernard, JM+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPROXIMATE REASONING+JUN 2005::[The geometry of asymptotic inference] Comment: on multivariate Jeffreys' priors+Bernardo,, J.M.+Stat.

Robust Small Area Estimation under Spatial Non-stationarity,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12245,APR 2018,54,0,"The effective use of spatial information in a regression-based approach to small area estimation is an important practical issue. One approach to account for geographic information is by extending the linear mixed model to allow for spatially correlated random area effects. An alternative is to include the spatial information by a non-parametric mixed models. Another option is geographic weighted regression where the model coefficients vary spatially across the geography of interest. Although these approaches are useful for estimating small area means efficiently under strict parametric assumptions, they can be sensitive to outliers. In this paper, we propose robust extensions of the geographically weighted empirical best linear unbiased predictor. In particular, we introduce robust projective and predictive estimators under spatial non-stationarity. Mean squared error estimation is performed by two analytic approaches that account for the spatial structure in the data. Model-based simulations show that the methodology proposed often leads to more efficient estimators. Furthermore, the analytic mean squared error estimators introduced have appealing properties in terms of stability and bias. Finally, we demonstrate in the application that the new methodology is a good choice for producing estimates for average rent prices of apartments in urban planning areas in Berlin.","Berlin housing data,bias correction,geographical weighted regression,mean squared error,model-based simulation,spatial statistics","GEOGRAPHICALLY WEIGHTED REGRESSION,MEAN SQUARED ERROR,PREDICTION,MODELS,BOOTSTRAP,NONSTATIONARITY,COMPONENTS,EBLUP","Baldermann, Claudia@Free Univ Berlin, Inst Stat & Econometr, Berlin, Germany::Salvati, Nicola@Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Econ Management, Pisa, Italy::Schmid, Timo@Free Univ Berlin, Inst Stat & Econometr, Berlin, Germany","Baldermann, Claudia@Free University of Berlin::Salvati, Nicola@University of Pisa::Schmid, Timo@Free University of Berlin","SALVATI, NICOLA@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4160-9387","Crop evapotranspiration: guidelines for computing crop water requirements.+Allen, R.

Estimation Techniques for Ordinal Data in Multiple Frame Surveys with Complex Sampling Designs,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12218,APR 2018,26,0,"Surveys usually include questions where individuals must select one in a series of possible options that can be sorted. On the other hand, multiple frame surveys are becoming a widely used method to decrease bias due to undercoverage of the target population. In this work, we propose statistical techniques for handling ordinal data coming from a multiple frame survey using complex sampling designs and auxiliary information. Our aim is to estimate proportions when the variable of interest has ordinal outcomes. Two estimators are constructed following model-assisted generalised regression and model calibration techniques. Theoretical properties are investigated for these estimators. Simulation studies with different sampling procedures are considered to evaluate the performance of the proposed estimators in finite size samples. An application to a real survey on opinions towards immigration is also included.","Complex surveys,generalised regression estimation,model-assisted inference,model calibration,multiple frames","CALIBRATION ESTIMATION,MODEL","del Mar Rueda, Maria@Univ Granada, Dept Stat & OR, Granada, Spain::Arcos, Antonio@Univ Granada, Dept Stat & OR, Granada, Spain::Molina, David@Univ Granada, Dept Stat & OR, Granada, Spain::Ranalli, Maria Giovanna@Univ Perugia, Dept Polit Sci, Perugia, Italy","del Mar Rueda, Maria@University of Granada::Arcos, Antonio@University of Granada::Molina, David@University of Granada::Ranalli, Maria Giovanna@University of Perugia","Rueda, Maria del Mar@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2903-8745","An Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis+Agresti, A.+WILEY SERIES PROBABI+2007::Frames2: A Package for Estimation in Dual Frame Surveys+Arcos, Antonio; Molina, David; Ranalli, Maria Giovanna; et al.+R JOURNAL+JUN 2015::ESTIMATORS BASED ON SEVERAL STRATIFIED SAMPLES WITH APPLICATIONS TO MULTIPLE FRAME SURVEYS+BANKIER, MD+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1986::ON THE VARIANCES OF ASYMPTOTICALLY NORMAL ESTIMATORS FROM COMPLEX SURVEYS+BINDER, DA+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+1983::Model-assisted estimation for complex surveys using penalised splines+Breidt, FJ; Claeskens, G; Opsomer, JD+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 2005::CALIBRATION ESTIMATORS IN SURVEY SAMPLING+DEVILLE, JC; SARNDAL, CE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1992::Estimators for samples selected from two overlapping frames+Fuller, W.

A Two-Step Procedure to Measure Representativeness of Internet Data Sources,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12217,DEC 2017,54,1,"So far, statistics has mainly relied on information collected from censuses and sample surveys, which are used to produce statistics about selected characteristics of the population. However, because of cost cuts and increasing non-response in sample surveys, statisticians have started to search for new sources of information, such as registers, Internet data sources (IDSs, i.e. web portals) or big data. Administrative sources are already used for purposes of official statistics, while the suitability of the latter two sources is currently being discussed in the literature. Unfortunately, only a few papers devoted to statistical theory point out methodological problems related to the use of IDSs, particularly in the context of survey methodology. The unknown generation mechanism and the complexity of such data are often neglected in view of their size. Hence, before IDSs can be used for statistical purposes, especially for official statistics, they need to be assessed in terms of such fundamental issues as representativeness, non-sampling errors or bias. The paper attempts to fill the first gap by proposing a two-step procedure to measure representativeness of IDSs. The procedure will be exemplified using data about the secondary real estate market in Poland.","representativeness,self-selection mechanism,non-probabilistic samples,Internet data sources,bigdata,real estate market","BIG DATA,SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE,HOUSEHOLD SURVEYS,STATISTICS,CENSUS,BIAS","Beresewicz, Maciej@Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Fac Informat & Elect Econ, Dept Stat, Al Niepodleglosci 10, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland@Stat Off Poznan, Ctr Small Area Estimat, Wojska Polskiego 27-29, PL-60624 Poznan, Poland","Beresewicz, Maciej@Unknow",not exist,"The Modern Census: Evolution, Examples and Evaluation+Baffour, Bernard; King, Thomas; Valente, Paolo+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+DEC 2013::On representativeness of Internet data sources for real estate market in Poland+Beresewicz, M.E.+Austrian J.

Modern Likelihood-Frequentist Inference,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12232,DEC 2017,60,1,"We offer an exposition of modern higher order likelihood inference and introduce software to implement this in a quite general setting. The aim is to make more accessible an important development in statistical theory and practice. The software, implemented in an R package, requires only that the user provide code to compute the likelihood function and to specify extra-likelihood aspects of the model, such as stopping rule or censoring model, through a function generating a dataset under the model. The exposition charts a narrow course through the developments, intending thereby to make these more widely accessible. It includes the likelihood ratio approximation to the distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator, that isthe p formula, and the transformation of this yielding a second-order approximation to the distribution of the signed likelihood ratio test statistic, based on a modified signed likelihood ratio statistic r. This follows developments of Barndorff-Nielsen and others. The software utilises the approximation to required Jacobians as developed by Skovgaard, which is included in the exposition. Several examples of using the software are provided.","Ancillary statistic,conditional inference,likelihood asymptotics,modified profile likelihood,modified signed likelihood ratio,neo-Fisherian inference,p formula,saddlepoint approximation","APPROXIMATE CONDITIONAL INFERENCE,HIGHER-ORDER APPROXIMATIONS,EXPONENTIAL-FAMILIES,PARAMETRIC INFERENCE,ASYMPTOTICS,RATIO,ANCILLARITY,TESTS,INFORMATION,STATISTICS","Pierce, Donald Alan@Oregon State Univ, Dept Stat, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA::Bellio, Ruggero@Univ Udine, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Stat, Udine, Italy","Pierce, Donald Alan@Oregon University System@Oregon State University::Bellio, Ruggero@University of Udine",not exist,"no title+Barndorff-Nielsen, O.

ADMM for Penalized Quantile Regression in Big Data,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12221,DEC 2017,42,0,"Traditional linear programming algorithms for quantile regression, for example, the simplex method and the interior point method, work well for data of small to moderate sizes. However, these methods are difficult to generalize to high-dimensional big data for which penalization is usually necessary. Further, the massive size of contemporary big data calls for the development of large-scale algorithms on distributed computing platforms. The traditional linear programming algorithms are intrinsically sequential and not suitable for such frameworks. In this paper, we discuss how to use the popular ADMM algorithm to solve large-scale penalized quantile regression problems. The ADMM algorithm can be easily parallelized and implemented in modern distributed frameworks. Simulation results demonstrate that the ADMM is as accurate as traditional LP algorithms while faster even in the nonparallel case.","Penalized quantile regression,ADMM,large-scale,divide-and-conquer,Hadoop,MapReduce","ALTERNATING DIRECTION METHOD,VARIABLE SELECTION,OPTIMIZATION,ALGORITHM,MULTIPLIERS,PENALTY,MODELS","Yu, Liqun@Washinton Univ, Dept Math, St Louis, MO 63130 USA::Lin, Nan@Washinton Univ, Dept Math, St Louis, MO 63130 USA","Yu, Liqun@Washington University (WUSTL)::Lin, Nan@Washington University (WUSTL)",not exist,"l(1)-PENALIZED QUANTILE REGRESSION IN HIGH-DIMENSIONAL SPARSE MODELS+Belloni, Alexandre; Chernozhukov, Victor+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 2011::Distributed Optimization and Statistical Learning via the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers+Boyd, S.; Parikh, N.; Chu, E.; et al.+Foundations and Trends in Machine Learning+2010::Computational issues for quantile regression+Chen, C; Wei, Y.+Sankhya: The Indian Journal of Statistics+2005::Mapreduce: Simplified data processing on large clusters+Dean, Jeffrey; Ghemawat, Sanjay+COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM+JAN 2008::On the Global and Linear Convergence of the Generalized Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers+Deng, Wei; Yin, Wotao+JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING+MAR 2016::ON THE DOUGLAS-RACHFORD SPLITTING METHOD AND THE PROXIMAL POINT ALGORITHM FOR MAXIMAL MONOTONE-OPERATORS+ECKSTEIN, J; BERTSEKAS, DP+MATHEMATICAL PROGRAMMING+JUL 6 1992::Variable selection via nonconcave penalized likelihood and its oracle properties+Fan, JQ; Li, RZ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2001::Applications of the method of multipliers to variational inequalities+Gabay, D.+Augmented Lagrangian Methods: Applications to the Solution of Boundary Value Problems+1983::A dual algorithm for the solution of nonlinear variational problems via finite element approximation+Gabay, D.; Mercier, B.+Computers &amp; Mathematics with Applications+1976::CLASS OF NONLINEAR DIRICHLET PROBLEMS - APPROXIMATION VIA FINITE FIRST-ORDER ELEMENT METHOD - SOLUTION VIA PENALTY AND DUALITY+GLOWINSKI, R; MARROCO, A+REVUE FRANCAISE D AUTOMATIQUE INFORMATIQUE RECHERCHE OPERATIONNELLE+1975::MULTIVARIATE QUANTILES AND MULTIPLE-OUTPUT REGRESSION QUANTILES: FROM L-1 OPTIMIZATION TO HALFSPACE DEPTH+Hallin, Marc; Paindaveine, Davy; Siman, Miroslav+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2010::ON THE O(1/n) CONVERGENCE RATE OF THE DOUGLAS-RACHFORD ALTERNATING DIRECTION METHOD+He, Bingsheng; Yuan, Xiaoming+SIAM JOURNAL ON NUMERICAL ANALYSIS+2012::On the linear convergence of the alternating direction method of multipliers+Hong, M.; Luo, Z.-Q.+arXiv preprint arXiv:1208.3922+2012::Convergence analysis of alternating direction method of multipliers for a family of nonconvex problems+Hong, M.; Luo, Z.-Q.; Razaviyayn, M.+arXiv preprint arXiv:1410.1390+2014::no title+Ignizio, J.P.+Goal Programming and Extensions+1976::A proof of convergence for the al-ternating direction method of multipliers applied to polyhedral-constrained functions+J., F.

Interview with Nancy Reid,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12237,DEC 2017,48,0,"Nancy Reid was born in September 1952 in Niagara Falls, Canada. She graduated from the University of Waterloo with a Bachelor in Mathematics and a major in Statistics in 1974. She pursued her training in Statistics at the University of British Columbia (UBC) where she obtained a Master's in Applied Mathematics in 1976 and at Stanford University, where she graduated with a PhD in Statistics in 1979. After spending one year at Imperial College in London visiting Sir David Cox, she joined UBC as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics, where she had an important role in the creation of the Department of Statistics. In 1986, she moved to the University of Toronto, where she has been since then as a faculty in the Department of Statistics. Nancy has served as Chair of the Department between 1997 and 2002. Nancy's research in conditional inference, higher order asymptotics and composite likelihood has been influential in Statistics. Her outstanding contributions to Statistics were recognized nationally and internationally with many awards, including the President's Award of the Committee of Presidents of Statistical Societies (COPSS), Gold Medal awarded by the Statistical Society of Canada and Elected Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences. She received the Doctor of Mathematics, Honoris Causa, University of Waterloo. Nancy served with distinction as Editor of the Canadian Journal of Statistics and President of the Statistical Society of Canada and President of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics. In 2014, she was appointed as Officer of the Order of Canada for her outstanding achievements, exemplary leadership and service to Canadians. The following conversation took place at the JSM 2016 in Chicago, on August 2 and 3, 2016.","Conditional inference,higher order asymptotics,composite likelihood,COPSS award","ACCURATE DIRECTIONAL INFERENCE,HIGHER-ORDER APPROXIMATIONS,LINEAR RANK STATISTICS,MODEL MISSPECIFICATION,CONDITIONAL INFERENCE,VECTOR PARAMETERS,CENSORED-DATA,LIKELIHOOD,ASYMPTOTICS,FREQUENTIST","Staicu, Ana-Maria@North Carolina State Univ, Dept Stat, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA::Reid, Nancy@Unknow","Staicu, Ana-Maria@North Carolina State University@University of North Carolina::Reid, Nancy@Unknow",not exist,"no title+Ahmed, S.

Variance Estimation of Imputed Estimators of Change for Repeated Rotating Surveys,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12197,DEC 2017,47,0,"A common problem in survey sampling is to compare two cross-sectional estimates for the same study variable taken from two different waves or occasions. These cross-sectional estimates often include imputed values to compensate for item non-response. The estimation of the sampling variance of the estimator of change is useful to judge whether the observed change is statistically significant. Estimating the variance of a change is not straightforward because of the rotation in repeated surveys and imputation. We propose using a multivariate linear regression approach and show how it can be used to accommodate the effect of rotation and imputation. The regression approach gives a design-consistent estimation of the variance of change when the sampling fraction is small. We illustrate the proposed approach using random hot-deck imputation, although the proposed estimator can be implemented with other imputation techniques.","Longitudinal surveys,missing data,non-response,overlapping samples,rotation,unequal inclusion probabilities","HOT DECK IMPUTATION,NONRESPONSE,STATISTICS","Berger, Yves G.@Univ Southampton, Southampton, Hants, England::Escobar, Emilio L.@Numerika, Mexico City, DF, Mexico","Berger, Yves G.@University of Southampton::Escobar, Emilio L.@Unknow",not exist,"A Review of Hot Deck Imputation for Survey Non-response+Andridge, Rebecca R.; Little, Roderick J.

Spatially Balanced Sampling: A Review and A Reappraisal,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12216,DEC 2017,64,1,"Spatially distributed data exhibit particular characteristics that should be considered when designing a survey of spatial units. Unfortunately, traditional sampling designs generally do not allow for spatial features, even though it is usually desirable to use information concerning spatial dependence in a sampling design. This paper reviews and compares some recently developed randomised spatial sampling procedures, using simple random sampling without replacement as a benchmark for comparison. The approach taken is design-based and serves to corroborate intuitive arguments about the need to explicitly integrate spatial dependence into sampling survey theory. Some guidance for choosing an appropriate spatial sampling design is provided, and some empirical evidence for the gains from using these designs with spatial populations is presented, using two datasets as illustrations.","design-based inference,spatial units,finite populations,spatial dependence,spatial statistics","EXCLUDING ADJACENT UNITS,INCLUSION PROBABILITIES,STRATIFIED DESIGNS,FOREST INVENTORIES,CONTIGUOUS UNITS,CUBE METHOD,RESOURCES,ALGORITHM,POPULATIONS,STRATEGIES","Benedetti, Roberto@Univ G dAnnunzio, Dept Econ Studies, I-65127 Pescara, Italy::Piersimoni, Federica@ISTAT, Directorate Methodol & Stat Proc Design, I-00184 Rome, Italy::Postiglione, Paolo@Univ G dAnnunzio, Dept Econ Studies, I-65127 Pescara, Italy","Benedetti, Roberto@G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara::Piersimoni, Federica@Unknow::Postiglione, Paolo@G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara",not exist,"no title+[Anonymous].+SMALL AREA ESTIMATIO+2015::THE USE OF GIS IN SPATIAL STATISTICAL SURVEYS+ARBIA, G+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+AUG 1993::Anisotropic spatial sampling designs for urban pollution+Arbia, G; Lafratta, G+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2002::A General Algorithm for Univariate Stratification+Baillargeon, Sophie; Rivest, Louis-Paul+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+DEC 2009::The construction of stratified designs in R with the package stratification+Baillargeon, Sophie; Rivest, Louis-Paul+SURVEY METHODOLOGY+JUN 2011::Sampling properties of spatial total estimators under tessellation stratified designs+Barabesi, L.; Franceschi, S.+ENVIRONMETRICS+MAY 2011::Improved strategies for coverage estimation by using replicated line-intercept sampling+Barabesi, Lucio; Marcheselli, Marzia+ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL STATISTICS+JUN 2008::OPTIMAL SAMPLING DESIGNS FOR DEPENDENT SPATIAL UNITS+BENEDETTI, R; PALMA, D+ENVIRONMETRICS+MAR-APR 1995::Sampling spatial units for agricultural surveys+Benedetti, R.; Piersimoni, F.; Postiglione, P.+ADV SPATIAL SCI SERI+2015::Comparing Implementations of Estimation Methods for Spatial Econometrics+Bivand, Roger; Piras, Gianfranco+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL SOFTWARE+JAN 2015::Optimal sampling for spatial prediction of functional data+Bohorquez, Martha; Giraldo, Ramon; Mateu, Jorge+STATISTICAL METHODS AND APPLICATIONS+MAR 2016::An Extension of Sampford's Method for Unequal Probability Sampling+Bondesson, Lennart; Grafstrom, Anton+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+JUN 2011::A list sequential sampling method suitable for real-time sampling+Bondesson, Lennart; Thorburn, Daniel+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+SEP 2008::Penalized balanced sampling+Breidt, F.

Expected Precision of Estimation and Probability of Ruling Out a Hypothesis Based on a Confidence Interval,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12213,DEC 2017,31,0,"Interval estimation is an important objective of most experimental and observational studies. Knowing at the design stage of the study how wide the confidence interval (CI) is expected to be and where its limits are expected to fall can be very informative. Asymptotic distribution of the confidence limits can also be used to answer complex questions of power analysis by computing power as probability that a CI will exclude a given parameter value. The CI-based approach to power and methods of calculating the expected size and location of asymptotic CIs as a measure of expected precision of estimation are reviewed in the present paper. The theory is illustrated with commonly used estimators, including unadjusted risk differences, odds ratios and rate ratios, as well as more complex estimators based on multivariable linear, logistic and Cox regression models. It is noted that in applications with the non-linear models, some care must be exercised when selecting the appropriate variance expression. In particular, the well-known short-cut' variance formula for the Cox model can be very inaccurate under unequal allocation of subjects to comparison groups. A more accurate expression is derived analytically and validated in simulations. Applications with exact' CIs are also considered.","confidence interval,power,precision,variance,risk difference,odds ratio,rate ratio,hazard ratio,linear regression,logistic regression,Cox regression","PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODEL,SAMPLE-SIZE CALCULATION,REGRESSION-MODEL,FIDUCIAL LIMITS,COVARIATE,TRIALS,RISK","Scosyrev, Emil@Novartis Pharmaceut, One Hlth Plaza, E Hanover, NJ 07936 USA::Bancken, Fabrice@Novartis Pharma AG, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland","Scosyrev, Emil@Novartis::Bancken, Fabrice@Novartis",not exist,"Dealing with discreteness: making 'exact' confidence intervals for proportions, differences of proportions, and odds ratios more exact+Agresti, A+STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH+JAN 2003::no title+Casella, G.; Berger, R.

"A Tutorial on Multilevel Survival Analysis: Methods, Models and Applications",INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12214,AUG 2017,35,6,"Data that have a multilevel structure occur frequently across a range of disciplines, including epidemiology, health services research, public health, education and sociology. We describe three families of regression models for the analysis of multilevel survival data. First, Cox proportional hazards models with mixed effects incorporate cluster-specific random effects that modify the baseline hazard function. Second, piecewise exponential survival models partition the duration of follow-up into mutually exclusive intervals and fit a model that assumes that the hazard function is constant within each interval. This is equivalent to a Poisson regression model that incorporates the duration of exposure within each interval. By incorporating cluster-specific random effects, generalised linear mixed models can be used to analyse these data. Third, after partitioning the duration of follow-up into mutually exclusive intervals, one can use discrete time survival models that use a complementary log-log generalised linear model to model the occurrence of the outcome of interest within each interval. Random effects can be incorporated to account for within-cluster homogeneity in outcomes. We illustrate the application of these methods using data consisting of patients hospitalised with a heart attack. We illustrate the application of these methods using three statistical programming languages (R, SAS and Stata).","Multilevel models,hierarchical regression model,survival analysis,event history models,Cox proportional hazards model,clustered data,health services research,statistical software,frailty models","COVARIANCE ANALYSIS,DATA METAANALYSIS,TIME,EVENT","Austin, Peter C.@Inst Clin Evaluat Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada","Austin, Peter C.@University of Toronto",not exist,"An introduction to survival and event history analysis+Aalen, Odd O.; Borgan, Ornulf; Gjessing, Hakon K.+SURVIVAL AND EVENT HISTORY ANALYSIS: A PROCESS POINT OF VIEW+2008::A REANALYSIS OF THE STANFORD HEART-TRANSPLANT DATA+AITKIN, M; LAIRD, N; FRANCIS, B+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1983::no title+Allison, PD.+Survival analysis using SAS: a practical guide+2010::Calculating the number needed to treat for trials where the outcome is time to an event+Altman, DG; Andersen, PK+BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL+DEC 4 1999::A substantial and confusing variation exists in handling of baseline covariates in randomized controlled trials: a review of trials published in leading medical journals+Austin, Peter C.; Manca, Andrea; Zwarenstein, Merrick; et al.+JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY+FEB 2010::The median hazard ratio: a useful measure of variance and general contextual effects in multilevel survival analysis+Austin, Peter C.; Wagner, Philippe; Merlo, Juan+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+MAR 2017::Discrete-time multilevel hazard analysis+Barber, JS; Murphy, SA; Axinn, WG; et al.+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODOLOGY 2000, VOL 30+2000::COVARIANCE ANALYSIS OF CENSORED SURVIVAL DATA+BRESLOW, N+BIOMETRICS+1974::no title+Cox, D.R.; Oakes, D.+Analysis of survival data+1984::Individual patient data meta-analysis of survival data using Poisson regression models+Crowther, Michael J.; Riley, Richard D.; Staessen, Jan A.; et al.+BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY+MAR 23 2012::Multilevel mixed effects parametric survival models using adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature with application to recurrent events and individual participant data meta-analysis+Crowther, Michael J.; Look, Maxime P.; Riley, Richard D.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+SEP 28 2014::The Frailty Model Introduction+Duchateau, Luc; Janssen, Paul+FRAILTY MODEL+2008::BIASED ESTIMATES OF TREATMENT EFFECT IN RANDOMIZED EXPERIMENTS WITH NONLINEAR REGRESSIONS AND OMITTED COVARIATES+GAIL, MH; WIEAND, S; PIANTADOSI, S+BIOMETRIKA+1984::no title+Goldstein, H.+Multilevel statistical models+2011::no title+Hougaard, P.+Analysis of Multivariate Survival Data+2000::no title+Hox, J.

A Comparison of two Robust Estimation Methods for Business Surveys,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12177,AUG 2017,40,1,"Two alternative robust estimation methods often employed by National Statistical Institutes in business surveys are two-sided M-estimation and one-sided Winsorisation, which can be regarded as an approximate implementation of one-sided M-estimation. We review these methods and evaluate their performance in a simulation of a repeated rotating business survey based on data from the Retail Sales Inquiry conducted by the UK Office for National Statistics. One-sided and two-sided M-estimation are found to have very similar performance, with a slight edge for the former for positive variables. Both methods considerably improve both level and movement estimators. Approaches for setting tuning parameters are evaluated for both methods, and this is a more important issue than the difference between the two approaches. M-estimation works best when tuning parameters are estimated using historical data but is serviceable even when only live data is available. Confidence interval coverage is much improved by the use of a bootstrap percentile confidence interval.","Bootstrap,mean squared error,M-estimation,movement estimation,influential values,outliers,robustness,sample survey,Winsorisation,Winsorization",OUTLIER,"Clark, Robert Graham@Univ Wollongong, Natl Inst Appl Stat Res, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia::Kokic, Philip@Univ Wollongong, Natl Inst Appl Stat Res, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia::Smith, Paul A.@Univ Southampton, Southampton Stat Sci Res Inst S3RI, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England","Clark, Robert Graham@University of Wollongong::Kokic, Philip@University of Wollongong::Smith, Paul A.@University of Southampton",not exist,"Estimation of finite population total for skewed data+Basak, P.; Chandra, H.; Sud, U.+J.

Methods for Scalar-on-Function Regression,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12163,AUG 2017,162,5,"Recent years have seen an explosion of activity in the field of functional data analysis (FDA), in which curves, spectra, images and so onare considered as basic functional data units. A central problem in FDA is how to fit regression models with scalar responses and functional data points as predictors. We review some of the main approaches to this problem, categorising the basic model types as linear, non-linear and non-parametric. We discuss publicly available software packages and illustrate some of the procedures by application to a functional magnetic resonance imaging data set.","Functional additive model,functional generalised linear model,functional linear model,functional polynomial regression,functional single-index model,non-parametric functional regression","GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,BAYESIAN BANDWIDTH ESTIMATION,UNKNOWN ERROR DENSITY,SMOOTHING PARAMETER SELECTION,PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS,TIME-SERIES PREDICTION,LIKELIHOOD RATIO TESTS,KERNEL HILBERT-SPACES,PARTIAL LEAST-SQUARES,NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION","Reiss, Philip T.@NYU, Sch Med, Dept Child & Adolescent Psychiat, New York, NY 10003 USA@NYU, Sch Med, Dept Populat Hlth, New York, NY 10003 USA@Univ Haifa, Dept Stat, Haifa, Israel::Goldsmith, Jeff@Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Stat, New York, NY USA::Shang, Han Lin@Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Finance Actuarial Studies & Stat, Canberra, ACT, Australia::Ogden, R.

"Modelling Clustered Heterogeneity: Fixed Effects, Random Effects and Mixtures",INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12161,AUG 2017,40,1,"Although each statistical unit on which measurements are taken is unique, typically there is not enough information available to account totally for its uniqueness. Therefore, heterogeneity among units has to be limited by structural assumptions. One classical approach is to use random effects models, which assume that heterogeneity can be described by distributional assumptions. However, inference may depend on the assumed mixing distribution, and it is assumed that the random effects and the observed covariates are independent. An alternative considered here is fixed effect models, which let each unit has its own parameter. They are quite flexible but suffer from the large number of parameters. The structural assumption made here is that there are clusters of units that share the same effects. It is shown how clusters can be identified by tailored regularised estimators. Moreover, it is shown that the regularised estimates compete well with estimates for the random effects model, even if the latter is the data generating model. They dominate if clusters are present.","Fixed effects,random effects,mixture modelling,heterogeneity,clustered heterogeneity","GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,VARIABLE SELECTION,REGRESSION-MODELS,ORACLE PROPERTIES,MIXED MODELS,LIKELIHOOD,LASSO,MISSPECIFICATION,ERROR","Tutz, Gerhard@Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Akad Str 1, D-80799 Munich, Germany::Oelker, Margret-Ruth@Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Akad Str 1, D-80799 Munich, Germany","Tutz, Gerhard@University of Munich::Oelker, Margret-Ruth@University of Munich",not exist,"Examples in which misspecification of a random effects distribution reduces efficiency, and possible remedies+Agresti, A; Caffo, B; Ohman-Strickland, P+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+OCT 2004::A general maximum likelihood analysis of variance components in generalized linear models+Aitkin, M+BIOMETRICS+MAR 1999::no title+Baltagi, B.+Econometric analysis of panel data+2008::lme4: Linear Mixed-Effects Models Using Eigen and S4+Bates, D.; Maechler, M.; Bolker, B.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Walker, S</span>.+R Package Version+2013::Simultaneous Factor Selection and Collapsing Levels in ANOVA+Bondell, Howard D.; Reich, Brian J.+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2009::no title+Curtin, T.

Design-based Estimators Calibrated on Estimated Totals from Multiple Surveys,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12160,AUG 2017,38,1,"The use of auxiliary variables to improve the efficiency of estimators is a well-known strategy in survey sampling. Typically, the auxiliary variables used are the totals of appropriate measurement that are exactly known from registers or administrative sources. Increasingly, however, these totals are estimated from surveys and are then used to calibrate estimators and improve their efficiency. We consider different types of survey structures and develop design-based estimators that are calibrated on known as well as estimated totals of auxiliary variables. The optimality properties of these estimators are studied. These estimators can be viewed as extensions of the Montanari generalised regression estimator adapted to the more complex situations. The paper studies interesting special cases to develop insights and guidelines to properly manage the survey-estimated auxiliary totals.","Auxiliary information,calibration,regression estimator,survey-estimated totals","COMBINING INFORMATION,REGRESSION ESTIMATOR,VARIANCE-ESTIMATION,SAMPLE-SURVEYS,PREDICTION,MODEL","Guandalini, Alessio@Italian Natl Inst Stat ISTAT, Integrat Qual Res & Prod Networks Dev Dept, Rome, Italy::Tille, Yves@Univ Neuchatel, Inst Stat, Neuchatel, Switzerland","Guandalini, Alessio@Unknow::Tille, Yves@University of Neuchatel",not exist,"Variance estimation of survey estimates calibrated on estimated control totals-An application to the extended regression estimator and the regression composite estimator+Berger, Yves G.; Munoz, Juan F.; Rancourt, Eric+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+MAY 15 2009::Linear weighting of sample survey data+Bethlehem, JG; Keller, WJ.+J Off Stat+1987::PREDICTION-THEORY FOR FINITE POPULATIONS WHEN MODEL-BASED AND DESIGN-BASED PRINCIPLES ARE COMBINED - WITH AN APPLICATION TO A STUDY OF CHOICE OF TRANSPORTATION MODE ACROSS THE ORESUND STRAITS+CASSEL, CM; SARNDAL, CE; WRETMAN, JH+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+1979::Robust case-weighting for multipurpose establishment surveys+Chambers, R.

Graphical Tools for Detecting Departures from Linear Mixed Model Assumptions and Some Remedial Measures,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12178,AUG 2017,78,1,"We review some results on the analysis of longitudinal data or, more generally, of repeated measures via linear mixed models starting with some exploratory statistical tools that may be employed to specify a tentative model. We follow with a summary of inferential procedures under a Gaussian set-up and then discuss different diagnostic methods focusing on residual analysis but also addressing global and local influence. Based on the interpretation of diagnostic plots related to three types of residuals (marginal, conditional and predicted random effects) as well as on other tools, we proceed to identify remedial measures for possible violations of the proposed model assumptions, ranging from fine-tuning of the model to the use of elliptically symmetric or skew-elliptical linear mixed models as well as of robust estimation methods. We specify many results available in the literature in a unified notation and highlight those with greater practical appeal. In each case, we discuss the availability of model diagnostics as well as of software and give general guidelines for model selection. We conclude with analyses of three practical examples and suggest further directions for research.","Leverage,local influence,mixed models,random coefficients,random effects,residual analysis","LOCAL INFLUENCE,INFLUENCE DIAGNOSTICS,LONGITUDINAL DATA,DELETION DIAGNOSTICS,REGRESSION,SELECTION,VARIANCE,MATRIX,INFORMATION,INFERENCE","Singer, Julio M.@Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Estat, Sao Paulo, Brazil::Rocha, Francisco M.

Vector Stochastic Processes with Polya-Type Correlation Structure,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12204,AUG 2017,31,1,"This paper introduces a simple method to construct a stationary process on the real line with a Polya-type covariance function and with any infinitely divisible marginal distribution, by randomising the timescale of the increment of a second-order Levy process with an appropriate positive random variable. With the construction method extended to the multivariate case, we construct vector stochastic processes with Polya-type direct covariance functions and with any specified infinitely divisible marginal distributions. This makes available a new class of non-Gaussian vector stochastic processes with flexible correlation structure for use in modelling and simulation.","Cross covariance,direct covariance,covariance matrix function,elliptically contoured process,Gaussian process,infinitely divisible,Levy process,Polya-type function","UHLENBECK-TYPE PROCESSES,ACTIVITY TIME PROCESS,SELF-SIMILAR LIMIT,RANDOM-FIELDS,DISTRIBUTIONS,STUDENT","Ma, Chunsheng@Wichita State Univ, Dept Math Stat & Phys, Wichita, KS 67260 USA@Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Econ, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China@Hubei Engn Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Xiaogan 432000, Hubei, Peoples R China","Ma, Chunsheng@Hubei Engineering University@Wichita State University@Wuhan University of Technology",not exist,"MULTIFRACTALITY OF PRODUCTS OF GEOMETRIC ORNSTEIN-UHLENBECK-TYPE PROCESSES+Anh, V.

From a System of National Accounts to a Process of National Wellbeing Accounting,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12215,AUG 2017,56,0,"There are repeated calls to go Beyond GDP', for measures of wellbeing and progress in addition to those that the System of National Accounts (SNA) is designed to provide. We identify key issues that can help build on the rigour of SNA whilst fitting the measurement of economic performance within a broader assessment of national wellbeing and progress. Such drivers are already leading to a proliferation of indicators and accounts, for example in the development of non-monetary measures of natural resources, but there are significant measurement challenges, not least the question of whether a single, overall measure or index of wellbeing is valid. But the challenge of measurement, per se, is one thing: in our view, a more critical issue is whether the measures will actually be used. We propose a dynamic and multi-staged approach for developing SNA, embracing the production and use of measures. This would start by identifying user requirements for wider measures, to provide the basis for national and cross-national developments in well-being accounting. We envisage greater branding and marketing of national well-being concepts to promote measures and support their use.

"Modelling the Ecological Comorbidity of Acute Respiratory Infection, Diarrhoea and Stunting among Children Under the Age of 5 Years in Somalia",INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12206,APR 2017,49,1,"The aim of this study was to assess spatial co-occurrence of acute respiratory infections (ARI), diarrhoea and stunting among children of the age between 6 and 59 months in Somalia. Data were obtained from routine biannual nutrition surveys conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization 2007-2010. A Bayesian hierarchical geostatistical shared component model was fitted to the residual spatial components of the three health conditions. Risk maps of the common spatial effects at 1 x 1 km resolution were derived. The empirical correlations of the enumeration area proportion were 0.37, 0.63 and 0.66 for ARI and stunting, diarrhoea and stunting and ARI and diarrhoea, respectively. Spatially, the posterior residual effects ranged 0.03-20.98, 0.16-6.37 and 0.08-9.66 for shared component between ARI and stunting, diarrhoea and stunting and ARI and diarrhoea, respectively. The analysis showed clearly that the spatial shared component between ARI, diarrhoea and stunting was higher in the southern part of the country. Interventions aimed at controlling and mitigating the adverse effects of these three childhood health conditions should focus on their common putative risk factors, particularly in the South in Somalia.","Diarrhoea,acute respiratory infections,stunting,geostatistics,shared component,Somalia","CATCH-UP GROWTH,EARLY-CHILDHOOD,MALNUTRITION,DISEASE,PNEUMONIA,DEATHS,HEALTH,IMPACT,RISK","Kinyoki, Damaris K.@Kenya Govt Med Res Ctr, Wellcome Trust Res Programme, INFORM Project, Spatial Hlth Metr Grp, Nairobi, Kenya::Manda, Samuel O.@South African Med Res Council, Biostat Res Unit, Pretoria, South Africa@Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Epidemiol & Biostat, Johannesburg, South Africa::Moloney, Grainne M.@UN Childrens Fund UNICEF, Nutr Sect, Kenya Country Off, UN Complex Gigiri, Nairobi, Kenya::Odundo, Elijah O.@UN Food & Agr Org, Food Secur & Nutr Anal Unit FSNAU Somalia, Ngecha Rd Campus, Nairobi, Kenya::Berkley, James A.@Ctr Geog Med Res Coast, Kenyan Med Res Inst, Wellcome Trust Res Programme, Kilifi, Kenya@Univ Oxford, CCVTM, Nuffield Dept Clin Med, Ctr Trop Med & Global Hlth, Oxford OX3 7LJ, England::Noor, Abdisalan M.@Kenya Govt Med Res Ctr, Wellcome Trust Res Programme, INFORM Project, Spatial Hlth Metr Grp, Nairobi, Kenya@Univ Oxford, CCVTM, Nuffield Dept Clin Med, Ctr Trop Med & Global Hlth, Oxford OX3 7LJ, England::Kandala, Ngianga-Bakwin@Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Epidemiol & Biostat, Johannesburg, South Africa@Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Warwick Evidence, Gibbet Hill, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England@Northumbria Univ, Fac Engn & Environm, Dept Math & Informat Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England","Kinyoki, Damaris K.@Kenya Medical Research Institute::Manda, Samuel O.@University of Witwatersrand@South African Medical Research Council::Moloney, Grainne M.@Unknow::Odundo, Elijah O.@Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)::Berkley, James A.@Kenya Medical Research Institute@University of Oxford::Noor, Abdisalan M.@Kenya Medical Research Institute@University of Oxford::Kandala, Ngianga-Bakwin@Northumbria University@University of Witwatersrand@University of Warwick",not exist,"The distribution of people and the dimension of place: methodologies to improve the global estimation of urban extents+Balk, D;

Statistical Scale Space Methods,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12155,APR 2017,137,3,"The goal of statistical scale space analysis is to extract scale-dependent features from noisy data. The data could be for example an observed time series or digital image in which case features in either different temporal or spatial scales would be sought. Since the 1990s, a number of statistical approaches to scale space analysis have been developed, most of them using smoothing to capture scales in the data, but other interpretations of scale have also been proposed. We review the various statistical scale space methods proposed and mention some of their applications.","Smoothing,multi-scale,curve fitting,time series,image processing,applications","BAYESIAN MULTISCALE ANALYSIS,TIME-SERIES,TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIONS,NORTHERN FENNOSCANDIA,SIGNIFICANT FEATURES,DENSITY-ESTIMATION,REGRESSION-CURVES,ADDITIVE-MODELS,SIZER ANALYSIS,IMAGES","Holmstrom, Lasse@Univ Oulu, Dept Math Sci, Oulu, Finland::Pasanen, Leena@Univ Oulu, Dept Math Sci, Oulu, Finland","Holmstrom, Lasse@University of Oulu::Pasanen, Leena@University of Oulu",not exist,"Sub sea surface temperatures in the Polar North Atlantic during the Holocene: Planktic foraminiferal Mg/Ca temperature reconstructions+Aagaard-Sorensen, Steffen; Husum, Katrine; Hald, Morten; et al.+HOLOCENE+JAN 2014::Acceleration of snow melt in an Antarctic Peninsula ice core during the twentieth century+Abram, Nerilie J.; Mulvaney, Robert; Wolff, Ericw.; et al.+NATURE GEOSCIENCE+MAY 2013::no title+[Anonymous].+International Statistical Review+2017::A LOOK AT SOME DATA ON THE OLD FAITHFUL GEYSER+AZZALINI, A; BOWMAN, AW+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+1990::Uniqueness of the Gaussian kernel for scale-space filtering+Babaud, J; Baudin, M; Witkin, AP<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Duda, R</span>.+Fairchild TR 645+1983::UNIQUENESS OF THE GAUSSIAN KERNEL FOR SCALE-SPACE FILTERING+BABAUD, J; WITKIN, AP; BAUDIN, M; et al.+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE+JAN 1986::Multiple Paleopolyploidizations during the Evolution of the Compositae Reveal Parallel Patterns of Duplicate Gene Retention after Millions of Years+Barker, Michael S.; Kane, Nolan C.; Matvienko, Marta; et al.+MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION+NOV 2008::Flicker-induced color and form: Interdependencies and relation to stimulation frequency and phase+Becker, C; Elliott, MA+CONSCIOUSNESS AND COGNITION+MAR 2006::Comparing telomere length of sister chromatids in human lymphocytes using three-dimensional confocal microscopy+Bekaert, S; Koll, S; Thas, O; et al.+CYTOMETRY+MAY 1 2002::Millennial-scale climate variability in the subpolar north atlantic ocean during the late Pliocene+Bolton, CT; Wilson, PA; Bailey, I<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Friedrich, O; Beer, CJ; Becker, J; Baranwal, S; Schiebel, R</span>.+Paleoceanography+2010::Scale space consistency of piecewise constant least squares estimators - another look at the regressogram+Boysen, L.; Liebscher, V.; Munk, A.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Wittich, O</span>.+Asymptotics: Particles, Processes and Inverse Problems: Festschrift for Piet Groeneboom+2007::Scale space view of curve estimation+Chaudhuri, P; Marron, JS+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2000::no title+Chaudhuri, P; Marron, J.+Curvature vs. slope inference for features in nonparametric curve estimates+2002::SiZer for exploration of structures in curves+Chaudhuri, P; Marron, JS+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1999::SiZer for exploration of inhomogeneous structure in temporal distribution of earthquakes+Chen, Shi-jun; Jia, Qing-hua; Ma, Li+EARTHQUAKE SCIENCE+SEP 2005::Episodic zircon age spectra of orogenic granitoids: The supercontinent connection and continental growth+Condie, Kent C.; Aster, Richard C.+PRECAMBRIAN RESEARCH+JUL 2010::Tropical Pacific-high latitude south Atlantic teleconnections as seen in delta O-18 variability in Antarctic coastal ice cores+Divine, D.

A Conversation with Roger Koenker,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12183,APR 2017,0,0,"Roger William Koenker was born February 21, 1947. He graduated from Grinnell College in 1969 and obtained his PhD in Economics from University of Michigan in 1974 under the direction of Saul Hymans. He was Assistant Professor of Economics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) from 1974 to 1976, and a member of Technical Staff at Bell Telephone Laboratories from 1976 to 1983 and returned to UIUC as Professor in 1983. He is currently a William B. McKinley Professor of Economics and Professor of Statistics at UIUC. He is best known for his seminal work on quantile regression, which has emerged as a powerful regression analysis tool across many disciplines. He is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, Fellow of Econometric Society, and recipient of the 2010 Emanuel and Carol Parzen Prize for Statistical Innovation. The conversation covers part of Roger Koenker's career as an econometrician and statistician, starting from his college years.","Econometrics,least absolute deviation,optimization,quantile regression",,"He, Xuming@Univ Michigan, Dept Stat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","He, Xuming@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan",not exist,
Functional Principal Component Regression and Functional Partial Least-squares Regression: An Overview and a Comparative Study,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12116,APR 2017,43,7,"Functional data analysis is a field of growing importance in Statistics. In particular, the functional linear model with scalar response is surely the model that has attracted more attention in both theoretical and applied research. Two of the most important methodologies used to estimate the parameters of the functional linear model with scalar response are functional principal component regression and functional partial least-squares regression. We provide an overview of estimation methods based on these methodologies and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. We emphasise that the role played by the functional principal components and by the functional partial least-squares components that are used in estimation appears to be very important to estimate the functional slope of the model.

Finally, we present an extensive comparative simulation study to compare the performance of all the considered methodologies that may help practitioners in the use of the functional linear model with scalar response.","Cross-validation,eigenfunctions,eigenvalues,functional linear model,functional principal components,functional partial least squares","LINEAR-REGRESSION,QUADRATIC-REGRESSION,SCALAR RESPONSE,MODELS,ESTIMATORS,CONVERGENCE,METHODOLOGY,PREDICTION,RATES","Febrero-Bande, Manuel@Univ Santiago de Compostela, Santiago De Compostela, Spain::Galeano, Pedro@Univ Carlos III Madrid, Madrid, Spain::Gonzalez-Manteiga, Wenceslao@Univ Santiago de Compostela, Santiago De Compostela, Spain","Febrero-Bande, Manuel@University of Santiago De Compostela::Galeano, Pedro@Universidad Carlos III de Madrid::Gonzalez-Manteiga, Wenceslao@University of Santiago De Compostela","Febrero-Bande, Manuel@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9536-2973","An approximated principal component prediction model for continuous-time stochastic processes+Aguilera, AM; Ocana, FA; Valderrama, MJ+APPLIED STOCHASTIC MODELS AND DATA ANALYSIS+JUN 1997::Using basis expansions for estimating functional PLS regression Applications with chemometric data+Aguilera, Ana M.; Escabias, Manuel; Preda, Cristian; et al.+CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS+DEC 15 2010::Prediction in functional linear regression+Cai, T.

One of the choke points affecting both accessibility to a broad spectrum of students and faster progress is classical statistical inference based on normal theory. In this paper, bootstrap-based confidence intervals and randomisation tests conveyed through dynamic visualisation are developed as a means of reducing cognitive demands and increasing the speed with which application areas can be opened up.

Multivariate Hill Estimators,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12120,APR 2017,57,1,We propose two classes of semi-parametric estimators for the tail index of a regular varying elliptical random vector. The first one is based on the distance between a tail probability contour and the observations outside this contour. We denote it as the class of separating estimators. The second one is based on the norm of an arbitrary order. We denote it as the class of angular estimators. We show the asymptotic properties and the finite sample performances of both classes. We also illustrate the separating estimators with an empirical application to 21 worldwide financial market indexes.,"Hill estimator,elliptical distribution,minimum covariance determinant,tail index,L-h norm","TAIL INDEX ESTIMATION,EXTREME-VALUE DISTRIBUTION,REGULAR VARIATION,DISTRIBUTIONS,DEPENDENCE,EXPONENT,QUANTILE,MAXIMUM,MODELS,LAW","Dominicy, Yves@Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, Solvay Brussels Sch Econ & Management, Brussels, Belgium::Ilmonen, Pauliina@Aalto Univ, Sch Sci, Dept Math & Syst Anal, Espoo, Finland::Veredas, David@Vlerick Business Sch, Ghent, Belgium@Univ Ghent, Ghent, Belgium","Dominicy, Yves@Solvay SA@Universite Libre de Bruxelles::Ilmonen, Pauliina@Aalto University::Veredas, David@Ghent University",not exist,"ON SOME LIMIT THEOREMS SIMILAR TO ARC-SIN LAW+BREIMAN, L+THEORY OF PROBILITY AND ITS APPLICATIONS,USSR+1965::MINIMUM-VARIANCE REDUCED-BIAS TAIL INDEX AND HIGH QUANTILE ESTIMATION+Caeiro, Frederico; Gomes, M.

Selecting Adaptive Survey Design Strata with Partial R-indicators,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12159,APR 2017,25,3,"Recent survey literature shows an increasing interest in survey designs that adapt data collection to characteristics of the survey target population. Given a specified quality objective function, the designs attempt to find an optimal balance between quality and costs. Finding the optimal balance may not be straightforward as corresponding optimisation problems are often highly non-linear and non-convex. In this paper, we discuss how to choose strata in such designs and how to allocate these strata in a sequential design with two phases. We use partial R-indicators to build profiles of the data units where more or less attention is required in the data collection. In allocating cases, we look at two extremes: surveys that are run only once, or infrequent, and surveys that are run continuously. We demonstrate the impact of the sample size in a simulation study and provide an application to a real survey, the Dutch Crime Victimisation Survey.","Non-response,responsive survey design,representativeness,paradata","SURVEY RESPONSE,REPRESENTATIVENESS","Schouten, Barry@Stat Netherlands, Dept Proc Dev IT & Methodol, NL-2490 HA The Hague, Netherlands::Shlomo, Natalie@Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Social Stat, Humanities Bridgeford St, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England","Schouten, Barry@Unknow::Shlomo, Natalie@University of Manchester",not exist,"Adaptive survey designs that minimize nonresponse and measurement risk+Calinescu, M.; Schouten, B.; Bhulai, S.+Discussion paper 201224+2012::Adaptive survey designs to minimize mode effects.

Posterior Inference in Bayesian Quantile Regression with Asymmetric Laplace Likelihood,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12114,DEC 2016,69,4,"The paper discusses the asymptotic validity of posterior inference of pseudo-Bayesian quantile regression methods with complete or censored data when an asymmetric Laplace likelihood is used. The asymmetric Laplace likelihood has a special place in the Bayesian quantile regression framework because the usual quantile regression estimator can be derived as the maximum likelihood estimator under such a model, and this working likelihood enables highly efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for posterior sampling. However, it seems to be under-recognised that the stationary distribution for the resulting posterior does not provide valid posterior inference directly. We demonstrate that a simple adjustment to the covariance matrix of the posterior chain leads to asymptotically valid posterior inference. Our simulation results confirm that the posterior inference, when appropriately adjusted, is an attractive alternative to other asymptotic approximations in quantile regression, especially in the presence of censored data.","Bayesian,censoring,posterior,quantile regression","EMPIRICAL LIKELIHOOD,SURVIVAL ANALYSIS,LONGITUDINAL DATA,MODELS,SELECTION","Yang, Yunwen@Google Inc, Seattle, WA 98103 USA::Wang, Huixia Judy@George Washington Univ, Dept Stat, Washington, DC 20052 USA::He, Xuming@Univ Michigan, Dept Stat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Yang, Yunwen@Google Incorporated::Wang, Huixia Judy@George Washington University::He, Xuming@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan",not exist,"Bayesian lasso-mixed quantile regression+Alhamazawi, R.; Yu, K.+J.

Statistical ideas are an essential part of this, and as a partial response, a thematic program on statistical inference, learning and models in big data was held in 2015 in Canada, under the general direction of the Canadian Statistical Sciences Institute, with major funding from, and most activities located at, the Fields Institute for Research in Mathematical Sciences. This paper gives an overview of the topics covered, describing challenges and strategies that seem common to many different areas of application and including some examples of applications to make these challenges and strategies more concrete.","aggregation,computational complexity,dimension reduction,high-dimensional data,streaming data,networks","HIGH-DIMENSIONAL REGRESSION,NONPARAMETRIC-ESTIMATION,OFFICIAL STATISTICS,ORACLE PROPERTIES,NETWORKS,LASSO,DECOMPOSITIONS,SURVEILLANCE,ESTIMATORS,CONFIDENCE","Franke, Beate@UCL, London, England::Plante, Jean-Francois@HEC Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada::Roscher, Ribana@Freie Univ, Berlin, Germany::Lee, En-Shiun Annie@Univ Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada::Smyth, Cathal@Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada::Hatefi, Armin@Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada::Chen, Fuqi@Western Univ, London, ON, Canada::Gil, Einat@Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada::Schwing, Alexander@Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada::Selvitella, Alessandro@McMaster Univ, Hamilton, ON, Canada::Hoffman, Michael M.@Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada::Grosse, Roger@Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada::Hendricks, Dieter@Univ Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa::Reid, Nancy@Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada","Franke, Beate@University College London@University of London::Plante, Jean-Francois@HEC Montreal@University of Montreal::Roscher, Ribana@Free University of Berlin::Lee, En-Shiun Annie@University of Waterloo::Smyth, Cathal@University of Toronto::Hatefi, Armin@University of Toronto::Chen, Fuqi@Western University (University of Western Ontario)::Gil, Einat@University of Toronto::Schwing, Alexander@University of Toronto::Selvitella, Alessandro@McMaster University::Hoffman, Michael M.@University of Toronto::Grosse, Roger@University of Toronto::Hendricks, Dieter@University of Witwatersrand::Reid, Nancy@University of Toronto","Roscher, Ribana@N-2238-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0094-6210::Hatefi, Armin@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8357-7125::Hendricks, Dieter@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4523-6386::Hoffman, Michael@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4517-1562","Penalty, shrinkage and pretest strategies.

"Adversarial and Amiable Inference in Medical Diagnosis, Reliability and Survival Analysis",INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12104,DEC 2016,30,2,"In this paper, we develop a family of bivariate beta distributions that encapsulate both positive and negative correlations, and which can be of general interest for Bayesian inference. We then invoke a use of these bivariate distributions in two contexts. The first is diagnostic testing in medicine, threat detection and signal processing. The second is system survivability assessment, relevant to engineering reliability and to survival analysis in biomedicine. In diagnostic testing, one encounters two parameters that characterize the efficacy of the testing mechanism: test sensitivity and test specificity. These tend to be adversarial when their values are interpreted as utilities. In system survivability, the parameters of interest are the component reliabilities, whose values when interpreted as utilities tend to exhibit co-operative (amiable) behavior. Besides probability modeling and Bayesian inference, this paper has a foundational import. Specifically, it advocates a conceptual change in how one may think about reliability and survival analysis. The philosophical writings of de Finetti, Kolmogorov, Popper and Savage, when brought to bear on these topics constitute the essence of this change. Its consequence is that we have at hand a defensible framework for invoking Bayesian inferential methods in diagnostics, reliability and survival analysis. Another consequence is a deeper appreciation of the judgment of independent lifetimes. Specifically, we make the important point that independent lifetimes entail at a minimum, a two-stage hierarchical construction.","Bayesian inference,bivariate beta distributions,chance,de Finetti's theorem,independence,risk analysis,signal processing,system survivability,threat detection","BIVARIATE BETA DISTRIBUTION,DISTRIBUTIONS,PROPENSITY","Singpurwalla, Nozer D.@City Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China::Arnold, Barry C.@Univ Calif Riverside, Riverside, CA 92521 USA::Gastwirth, Joseph L.@George Washington Univ, Washington, DC USA::Gordon, Anna S.@Mindjet Corp, San Francisco, CA USA::Ng, Hon Keung Tony@Southern Methodist Univ, Dallas, TX USA","Singpurwalla, Nozer D.@City University of Hong Kong::Arnold, Barry C.@University of California System@University of California Riverside::Gastwirth, Joseph L.@George Washington University::Gordon, Anna S.@Unknow::Ng, Hon Keung Tony@Southern Methodist University","SINGPURWALLA, Nozer Darabsha@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3578-2308","LIFE LENGTHS AND ASSOCIATION - A DYNAMIC APPROACH+ARJAS, E; NORROS, I+MATHEMATICS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH+1984::Information and reliability: A Bayesian perspective+Arjas, E.+Reliability and Decision Making+1993::Flexible bivariate beta distributions+Arnold, Barry C.; Hon Keung Tony Ng+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+SEP 2011::no title+BALAKRISHNAN, N.; LAI, C-D.+Continuous Bivariate Distributions+2009::no title+Barlow, R.E.; Mendel, M.B.+Similarity as a Probabilistic Characteristic of Aging+1993::BAYESIAN OUTLOOK AND ITS APPLICATION+CORNFIELD, J+BIOMETRICS+1969::PROPERTIES OF DIAGNOSTIC DATA DISTRIBUTIONS+DAWID, AP+BIOMETRICS+1976::La prevision: Ses lois logiques, ses sources subjectives+De Finetti, B.+Annales de IInstitut Henri Poincare+1937::The statistical precision of medical screening procedures: Application to polygraph and AIDS antibodies test data+Gastwirth, J.L.+Stat.

A Review on Modal Clustering,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12109,DEC 2016,89,1,"In spite of the current availability of numerous methods of cluster analysis, evaluating a clustering configuration is questionable without the definition of a true population structure, representing the ideal partition that clustering methods should try to approximate. A precise statistical notion of cluster, unshared by most of the mainstream methods, is provided by the density-based approach, which assumes that clusters are associated to some specific features of the probability distribution underlying the data. The non-parametric formulation of this approach, known as modal clustering, draws a correspondence between the groups and the modes of the density function. An appealing implication is that the ill-specified task of cluster detection can be regarded to as a more circumscribed problem of estimation, and the number of clusters is also conceptually well defined. In this work, modal clustering is critically reviewed from both conceptual and operational standpoints. The main directions of current research are outlined as well as some challenges and directions of further research.","Density-based clustering,kernel density estimation,mode hunting,non-parametric estimation","NONPARAMETRIC DENSITY-ESTIMATION,MEAN-SHIFT,LEVEL SETS,BANDWIDTH SELECTION,CROSS-VALIDATION,SINGLE LINKAGE,VISUALIZATION,ALGORITHM,TREES,RATES","Menardi, Giovanna@Univ Padua, Dipartimento Sci Stat, Via C Battisti 241, I-35121 Padua, Italy","Menardi, Giovanna@University of Padua",not exist,"OPTICS: Ordering points to identify the clustering structure+Ankerst, M; Breunig, MM; Kriegel, HP; et al.+SIGMOD RECORD, VOL 28, NO 2 - JUNE 1999: SIGMOD99: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 1999 ACM SIGMOD - INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MANAGEMENT OF DATA+1999::Clustering via Nonparametric Density Estimation: The R Package pdfCluster+Azzalini, Adelchi; Menardi, Giovanna+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL SOFTWARE+APR 2014::Clustering via nonparametric density estimation+Azzalini, Adelchi; Torelli, Nicola+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+MAR 2007::Set estimation and nonparametric detection+Baillo, A; Cuevas, A; Justel, A+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+DEC 2000::Total error in a plug-in estimator of level sets+Baillo, A+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+DEC 15 2003::Convergence rates in nonparametric estimation of level sets+Baillo, A; Cuesta-Albertos, JA; Cuevas, A+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+MAY 15 2001::Support vector clustering+Ben-Hur, A; Horn, D; Siegelmann, HT; et al.+JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH+SPR 2002::AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD OF CROSS-VALIDATION FOR THE SMOOTHING OF DENSITY ESTIMATES+BOWMAN, AW+BIOMETRIKA+1984::Multivariate mode hunting: Data analytic tools with measures of significance+Burman, Prabir; Polonik, Wolfgang+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+JUL 2009::FINDING NATURAL CLUSTERS+CARMICHAEL, JW; GEORGE, JA; JULIUS, RS+SYSTEMATIC ZOOLOGY+1968::Generalised blurring mean-shift algorithms for nonparametric clustering+Carreira-Perpinan, M.

On Goodness of Fit for Operational Risk,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12112,DEC 2016,43,1,"The Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) to operational risk, as described by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2011), provides a framework meant to be used by banks for establishing the capital required to be set aside to cover worst-case operational loss scenarios. The problems raised by an AMA approach are primarily statistical in nature, and many lie at the frontier of statistical research. The aim of this paper is to contribute to one of the more pressing challenges of an AMA, namely that of testing the goodness of fit (GoF) of a distributional family to operational loss data. Our focus is on extending certain classically known tests, such as that of Anderson-Darling, with particular emphasis on the right tails of the distributions. The nature of such GoF tests is examined in detail, and computational efficiency of the procedures is taken into account. We also propose a novel saddlepoint approximation method for assessing the asymptotic null distributions of the test statistics based on the eigenvalues of covariance kernels estimated via a jackknife and influence function-based approach.","Anderson-Darling upper-tail test,covariance kernel,eigenvalues,goodness of fit,heavy tails,influence function,jackknife,operational risk,order statistics,saddlepoint approximation","ANDERSON-DARLING TEST,INDEPENDENT RANDOM-VARIABLES,LOG LIKELIHOOD RATIO,QUADRATIC-FORMS,PARAMETERS,APPROXIMATION,CONVERGENCE,STATISTICS,TESTS,TAIL","Feuerverger, Andrey@Univ Toronto, Dept Stat Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada","Feuerverger, Andrey@University of Toronto",not exist,"A GENERAL CLASS OF COEFFICIENTS OF DIVERGENCE OF 1 DISTRIBUTION FROM ANOTHER+ALI, SM; SILVEY, SD+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1966::ASYMPTOTIC THEORY OF CERTAIN GOODNESS OF FIT CRITERIA BASED ON STOCHASTIC PROCESSES+ANDERSON, TW; DARLING, DA+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1952::A TEST OF GOODNESS OF FIT+ANDERSON, TW; DARLING, DA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1954::no title+Ash, R.B.; Gardner, M.F.+TOPICS STOCHASTIC PR+1975::MODIFIED SIGNED LOG LIKELIHOOD RATIO+BARNDORFFNIELSEN, OE+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1991::INFERENCE ON FULL OR PARTIAL PARAMETERS BASED ON THE STANDARDIZED SIGNED LOG LIKELIHOOD RATIO+BARNDORFFNIELSEN, OE+BIOMETRIKA+AUG 1986::no title+no author+Operational Risk: Supervisory Guidelines for the Advanced Measurement Approaches+2011::General saddlepoint approximations: Application to the Anderson-Darling test statistic+Chen, Qian; Giles, David E.+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+2008::Composite goodness-of-fit tests for left-truncated loss samples+Chernobai, A; Rachev, ST; Fabozzi, FJ.+HDB FINANCIAL ECONOM+2012::no title+Chernobai, A.S.; Rachev, S.T.; Fabozzi, F.J.+Operational risk: A guide to Basel II capital requirements, models, and analysis+2007::no title+Courant, R.; Hilbert, D.+Methods of Mathematical Physics+1953::On the composition of elementary errors+Cramer, Harald+SKANDINAVISK AKTUARIETIDSKRIFT+1928::Eine informationstheoretische Ungleichung und ihre Anwendung auf den Beweis der Ergodizit at von Markoffschen Ketten.

Lognormal Distributions and Geometric Averages of Symmetric Positive Definite Matrices,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12113,DEC 2016,65,1,"This article gives a formal definition of a lognormal family of probability distributions on the set of symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices, seen as a matrix-variate extension of the univariate lognormal family of distributions. Two forms of this distribution are obtained as the large sample limiting distribution via the central limit theorem of two types of geometric averages of i.i.d. SPD matrices: the log-Euclidean average and the canonical geometric average. These averages correspond to two different geometries imposed on the set of SPD matrices. The limiting distributions of these averages are used to provide large-sample confidence regions and two-sample tests for the corresponding population means. The methods are illustrated on a voxelwise analysis of diffusion tensor imaging data, permitting a comparison between the various average types from the point of view of their sampling variability.","Random matrices,symmetric matrices,Riemannian manifolds,intrinsic means,manifold-valued data","EXTRINSIC SAMPLE MEANS,LOG-EUCLIDEAN METRICS,DIFFUSION-TENSOR MRI,RIEMANNIAN GEOMETRY,INTRINSIC ANALYSIS,MANIFOLDS,COVARIANCE,STATISTICS,EIGENVECTORS,EIGENVALUES","Schwartzman, Armin@North Carolina State Univ, Dept Stat, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Schwartzman, Armin@North Carolina State University@University of North Carolina","Schwartzman, Armin@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5335-1611","A geometric analysis of diffusion tensor measurements of the human brain+Alexander, AL; Hasan, K; Kindlmann, G; et al.+MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE+AUG 2000::no title+Anderson, T.

H-likelihood Predictive Intervals for Unobservables,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12115,DEC 2016,44,2,"Inferences about unobserved random variables, such as future observations, random effects and latent variables, are of interest. In this paper, to make probability statements about unobserved random variables without assuming priors on fixed parameters, we propose the use of the confidence distribution for fixed parameters. We focus on their interval estimators and related probability statements. In random-effect models, intervals can be formed either for future (yet-to-be-realised) random effects or for realised values of random effects. The consistency of intervals for these two cases requires different regularity conditions. Via numerical studies, their finite sampling properties are investigated.","Predictive distribution,confidence distribution,posterior distribution,likelihood,extended likelihood,h-likelihood,integrated likelihood,likelihood principle,extended likelihood principle,random effects,prediction interval,confidence interval","LINEAR MIXED MODELS,INFERENCE","Lee, Youngjo@Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Stat, Seoul, South Korea::Kim, Gwangsu@Korea Univ, Dept Stat, Seoul, South Korea","Lee, Youngjo@Seoul National University::Kim, Gwangsu@Korea University",not exist,"no title+Aitchison, J.; Dunsmore, I.

Implications of the Data Revolution for Statistics Education,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12110,DEC 2016,65,6,"There has never been a more exciting time to be involved in statistics. Emerging data sources provide new sorts of evidence, provoke new sorts of questions, make possible new sorts of answers and shape the ways that evidence is used to influence policy, public opinion and business practices. Significant developments include open data, big data, data visualisation and the rise of data-driven journalism. These developments are changing the nature of the evidence that is available, the ways in which it is presented and used and the skills needed for its interpretation. Educators should place less emphasis on small samples and linear models and more emphasis on large samples, multivariate description and data visualisation. Techniques used to analyse big data need to be taught. The increasing diversity of data usage requires deeper conceptual analysis in the curriculum; this should include explorations of the functions of modelling, and the politics of data and ethics. The data revolution can invigorate the existing curriculum by exemplifying the perils of biassed sampling, corruption of measures and modelling failures. Students need to learn to think statistically and to develop an aesthetic for data handling and modelling based on solving practical problems.","statistics education,modelling,open data,big data,visualisation,data-driven journalism,curriculum,statistical literacy,change",,"Ridgway, Jim@Univ Durham, Sch Educ, Leazes Rd, Durham DH1 1TA, England","Ridgway, Jim@Durham University",not exist,"The end of theory: the data deluge makes the scientific method obsolete+Anderson, C.+END THEORY DATA DELU+2008::Cassandra's curse: How The Limits to Growth was demonized+Bardi, U.+Ugo Bardi+2008::Overview: Challenges for Teaching Statistics in School Mathematics and Preparing Mathematics Teachers+Batanero, Carmen; Burrill, Gail; Reading, Chris+TEACHING STATISTICS IN SCHOOL MATHEMATICS - CHALLENGES FOR TEACHING AND TEACHER EDUCATION: A JOINT ICMI/IASE STUDY - THE 18TH ICMI STUDY: JOINT ICMI/IASE STUDE: THE 18TH ICMI STUDY+2011::no title+Bilton, N.+Friends, and influence, for sale online+2014::no title+Box, G.E.P.; Draper, H.R.+Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces+1987::no title+Bradshaw, P.+How to be a data journalist+2010::Statistical modeling: The two cultures+Breiman, L+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+AUG 2001::no title+no author+British National Formulary+2014::no title+Brooke, H.+The Revolution will be Digitised: Dispatches from the Information War+2010::Students' misconceptions of statistical inference: A review of the empirical evidence from research on statistics education+Castro Sotos, A.; Vanhoof, S.; Van Den Noortgate, W.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Onghena, P</span>.+Educational Research Review+2007::Avoiding statistical pitfalls+Chatfield, C.+Statistical Science+1991::The introductory statistics course: A ptolemaic curriculum?+Cobb, G.W.+Tech.

Enhancing Statistics Education by Including Qualitative Research,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12158,AUG 2016,48,5,"In this paper, we propose to re-examine the role of qualitative thinking in the early stages of learning statistics and, where relevant, integrate selected elements of qualitative research methods into statistics curricula. We believe that this can help to improve statistics education, deepen desired student understanding of the role of statistics in providing answers to real-world problems and address recurring concerns about student motivation. The paper clarifies the logic underlying our proposal, examines existing connections between qualitative and quantitative research during instruction that often go unacknowledged and can be built upon, explores practical implementation issues and discusses advantages as well as limitations of the proposed approach.","Statistics education,qualitative research,qualitative thinking,qualitative variables,quantitative research,quantitative variables,statistics curriculum,research process,student motivation,skill transfer","MIXED METHODS,SERVICE,FIELD,VIEW","Ograjensek, Irena@Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia::Gal, Iddo@Univ Haifa, Dept Human Serv, Haifa, Israel","Ograjensek, Irena@University of Ljubljana::Gal, Iddo@University of Haifa",not exist,"no title+Aliaga, M.; Cobb, G.; Cuff, C.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Garfield, J.; Gould, R.; Lock, R.; Witmer, J</span>.+Guidelines on assessment and instruction in statistics education+2010::no title+Babbie, E.+Practice of social research+1995::Ethnography: relating the part to the whole+Baszinger, I.; Dodier, N.+Qualitative Research: Theory, Method and Practice+2004::Reasoning about variability in comparing distributions+Ben-Zvi, D.+Stat.

Standardization of Variables and Collinearity Diagnostic in Ridge Regression,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12099,AUG 2016,42,7,"Ridge estimation (RE) is an alternative method to ordinary least squares when there exists a collinearity problem in a linear regression model. The variance inflator factor (VIF) is applied to test if the problem exists in the original model and is also necessary after applying the ridge estimate to check if the chosen value for parameter k has mitigated the collinearity problem. This paper shows that the application of the original data when working with the ridge estimate leads to non-monotone VIF values. Garcia et al. (2014) showed some problems with the traditional VIF used in RE. We propose an augmented VIF, VIFR(j,k), associated with RE, which is obtained by standardizing the data before augmenting the model. The VIFR(j,k) will coincide with the VIF associated with the ordinary least squares estimator when k = 0. The augmented VIF has the very desirable properties of being continuous, monotone in the ridge parameter and higher than one.","Collinearity,linear regression,variance inflator factor,ridge regression,standardization","NONORTHOGONAL PROBLEMS,MULTICOLLINEARITY,ANOMALIES,FOUNDATIONS,CRITIQUE","Garcia, Jose@Almeria Univ, Dept Econ & Business, Almeria 04120, Spain::Salmeron, Roman@Univ Granada, Dept Quantitat Methods Econ & Business, E-18071 Granada, Spain::Garcia, Catalina@Univ Granada, Dept Quantitat Methods Econ & Business, E-18071 Granada, Spain::Lopez Martin, Maria del Mar@Univ Granada, Dept Quantitat Methods Econ & Business, E-18071 Granada, Spain","Garcia, Jose@Universidad de Almeria::Salmeron, Roman@University of Granada::Garcia, Catalina@University of Granada::Lopez Martin, Maria del Mar@University of Granada","garcia, catalina@M-9019-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1622-3877","no title+ANDERSON TW+INTRO MULTIVARIATE S+1985::ASSESSING THE PRESENCE OF HARMFUL COLLINEARITY AND OTHER FORMS OF WEAK DATA THROUGH A TEST FOR SIGNAL-TO-NOISE+BELSLEY, DA+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+1982::no title+Belsley, DA; Kuh, E; Welsch, RE.+Regression Diagnostics: Identifying Influential Data and Sources of Collinearity+1980::The corrected vif+Dias, J.; Castro, J.+J.

Stable Asymptotics for M-estimators,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12102,AUG 2016,34,1,"We review some first-order and higher-order asymptotic techniques for M-estimators, and we study their stability in the presence of data contaminations. We show that the estimating function () and its derivative with respect to the parameter (delta?) play a central role. We discuss in detail the first-order Gaussian density approximation, saddlepoint density approximation, saddlepoint test, tail area approximation via the Lugannani-Rice formula and empirical saddlepoint density approximation (a technique related to the empirical likelihood method). For all these asymptotics, we show that a bounded (in the Euclidean norm) and a bounded delta? (e.g. in the Frobenius norm) yield stable inference in the presence of data contamination. We motivate and illustrate our findings by theoretical and numerical examples about the benchmark case of one-dimensional location model.","Edgeworth expansion,empirical likelihood,higher-order,infinitesimal robustness,p-value,redescending M-estimator,relative error,saddlepoint techniques,von Mises expansion","GENERAL SADDLEPOINT APPROXIMATIONS,MULTIVARIATE M-ESTIMATORS,EMPIRICAL LIKELIHOOD,EXPANSIONS,TESTS","La Vecchia, Davide@Monash Univ, Econometr & Business Stat Dept, Melbourne, Vic, Australia@Univ St Gallen, Inst Math & Stat, Sch Econ & Polit Sci, St Gallen, Switzerland","La Vecchia, Davide@Monash University@University of St Gallen",not exist,"no title+BARNDORFFNIELSE.OE+ASYMPTOTIC TECHNIQUE+1989::no title+Brazzale, A.

Alternative Indicators for the Risk of Non-response Bias: A Simulation Study,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12100,APR 2016,36,7,"The growth of non-response rates for social science surveys has led to increased concern about the risk of non-response bias. Unfortunately, the non-response rate is a poor indicator of when non-response bias is likely to occur. We consider in this paper a set of alternative indicators. A large-scale simulation study is used to explore how each of these indicators performs in a variety of circumstances. Although, as expected, none of the indicators fully depict the impact of non-response in survey estimates, we discuss how they can be used when creating a plausible account of the risks for non-response bias for a survey. We also describe an interesting characteristic of the fraction of missing information that may be helpful in diagnosing not-missing-at-random mechanisms in certain situations.","Bias,missing data,non-response,non-response indicators,survey data quality measures","RESPONSIVE DESIGN,HOUSEHOLD SURVEYS,DATA-COLLECTION,RATES","Nishimura, Raphael@Univ Michigan, Program Survey Methodol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA::Wagner, James@Univ Michigan, Inst Social Res, Ann Arbor, MI USA::Elliott, Michael@Univ Michigan, Inst Social Res, Ann Arbor, MI USA","Nishimura, Raphael@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan::Wagner, James@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan::Elliott, Michael@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan",not exist,"Proxy Pattern-Mixture Analysis for Survey Nonresponse+Andridge, Rebecca R.; Little, Roderick J.

Their careers and even family lives entwine, and both go on to join the pantheon of Canada's great statisticians. This all begins at a time when North American university education, and access to it, is growing explosively. It begins at a small start-up university, an upstart start-up that eschews conventional wisdom, finds a way to mine a seam of the brightest high school students and innovatescatching important waves and becoming a mathematical sciences powerhouse. In this interview, we explore these stories and some lessons that might be learned from them.

On Invariant Post-randomization for Statistical Disclosure Control,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12092,APR 2016,36,1,"In this paper, we investigate certain operational and inferential aspects of invariant Post-randomization Method (PRAM) as a tool for disclosure limitation of categorical data. Invariant PRAM preserves unbiasedness of certain estimators, but inflates their variances and distorts other attributes. We introduce the concept of strongly invariant PRAM, which does not affect data utility or the properties of any statistical method. However, the procedure seems feasible in limited situations. We review methods for constructing invariant PRAM matrices and prove that a conditional approach, which can preserve the original data on any subset of variables, yields invariant PRAM. For multinomial sampling, we derive expressions for variance inflation inflicted by invariant PRAM and variances of certain estimators of the cell probabilities and also their tight upper bounds. We discuss estimation of these quantities and thereby assessing statistical efficiency loss from applying invariant PRAM. We find a connection between invariant PRAM and creating partially synthetic data using a non-parametric approach, and compare estimation variance under the two approaches. Finally, we discuss some aspects of invariant PRAM in a general survey context.","Categorical data,randomized response,sampling design,synthetic data,unbiased estimation,variance inflation","RESPONSE SURVEYS,MICRODATA,RISK,MISCLASSIFICATION,LIMITATION,PROTECTION,SUBJECT,MODEL","Nayak, Tapan K.@US Bur Census, Ctr Disclosure Avoidance Res, Washington, DC 20233 USA@George Washington Univ, Dept Stat, Washington, DC 20052 USA::Adeshiyan, Samson A.@US Energy Informat Adm, Washington, DC 20585 USA","Nayak, Tapan K.@George Washington University::Adeshiyan, Samson A.@Unknow",not exist,"Multiple imputation: an alternative to top coding for statistical disclosure control+An, Di; Little, Roderick J.

Treatment and Control Groups in a Dynamic Setting,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12096,APR 2016,17,0,"The paper considers a version of the question of how to define treatment and control groups in a dynamic setting where treatments can occur at any time (but only once). The version considered pre-supposes that treatments as well as outcomes can be conceptualised as events occurring in temporal locations of a discrete time axis. It is proposed to think of effects as being dependent on both the time when and the time since the treatment occurred. The paper develops corresponding definitions of treatment and control groups, and proposes a notion of comprehensive treatment effect' that takes into account how treatment and control groups are generated. Based on this notion, the paper discusses causal interpretations that do not pre-suppose a potential outcomes framework.","Treatment group,control group,effect shape,comprehensive treatment effect,causal interpretation","MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS,LABOR-MARKET PROGRAMS,CAUSAL,IDENTIFICATION,INFERENCE,DURATION","Rohwer, Goetz@Ruhr Univ Bochum, Fac Social Sci, D-44750 Bochum, Germany","Rohwer, Goetz@Ruhr University Bochum",not exist,"The nonparametric identification of treatment effects in duration models+Abbring, JH; Van den Berg, GJ+ECONOMETRICA+SEP 2003::Why do cohabiting couples marry?

The finite sample behaviour of the weights obtained by the three calibration weighting methods and the effectiveness of the proposed weight trimming method are examined through limited simulation studies.","Exponential tilting,Kullback-Leibler distance,Newton-Raphson procedure,range-restricted calibration weights,regression weighting,pseudo empirical likelihood","EMPIRICAL LIKELIHOOD METHODS,EXPECTED MARGINAL TOTALS,AUXILIARY INFORMATION,FINITE POPULATIONS,SAMPLE-SURVEYS,ESTIMATORS,NONRESPONSE,EFFICIENT,MODEL,ADJUST","Wu, Changbao@Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada::Lu, Wilson W.@Acadia Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Wolfville, NS B4P 2R6, Canada","Wu, Changbao@University of Waterloo::Lu, Wilson W.@Acadia University",not exist,"A class of methods for using person controls in household weighting+Alexander, C.

Reliable Robust Regression Diagnostics,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12103,APR 2016,38,1,"Motivated by the requirement of controlling the number of false discoveries that arises in several application fields, we study the behaviour of diagnostic procedures obtained from popular high-breakdown regression estimators when no outlier is present in the data. We find that the empirical error rates for many of the available techniques are surprisingly far from the prescribed nominal level. Therefore, we propose a simulation-based approach to correct the liberal diagnostics and reach reliable inferences. We provide evidence that our approach performs well in a wide range of settings of practical interest and for a variety of robust regression techniques, thus showing general appeal. We also evaluate the loss of power that can be expected from our corrections under different contamination schemes and show that this loss is often not dramatic. Finally, we detail some possible extensions that may further enhance the applicability of the method.","Forward search,FSDA toolbox,MM-estimation,outlier detection,S-estimation,test size and power,trimming","LEAST TRIMMED SQUARES,OUTLIER DETECTION,MULTIVARIATE OUTLIERS,LINEAR-REGRESSION,S-ESTIMATORS,DATA SETS,SCATTER,CONSISTENCY,EFFICIENCY,TESTS","Salini, Silvia@Univ Milan, Dept Econ Management & Quantitat Methods, Milan, Italy::Cerioli, Andrea@Univ Parma, Dept Econ, I-43100 Parma, Italy::Laurini, Fabrizio@Univ Parma, Dept Econ, I-43100 Parma, Italy::Riani, Marco@Univ Parma, Dept Econ, I-43100 Parma, Italy","Salini, Silvia@University of Milan::Cerioli, Andrea@University of Parma::Laurini, Fabrizio@University of Parma::Riani, Marco@University of Parma","Salini, Silvia@P-8791-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6106-9835::Riani, Marco@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7886-2207","SPARSE LEAST TRIMMED SQUARES REGRESSION FOR ANALYZING HIGH-DIMENSIONAL LARGE DATA SETS+Alfons, Andreas; Croux, Christophe; Gelper, Sarah+ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS+MAR 2013::no title+Atkinson, A.

A Review of Modern Computational Algorithms for Bayesian Optimal Design,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12107,APR 2016,113,17,"Bayesian experimental design is a fast growing area of research with many real-world applications. As computational power has increased over the years, so has the development of simulation-based design methods, which involve a number of algorithms, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo, sequential Monte Carlo and approximate Bayes methods, facilitating more complex design problems to be solved. The Bayesian framework provides a unified approach for incorporating prior information and/or uncertainties regarding the statistical model with a utility function which describes the experimental aims. In this paper, we provide a general overview on the concepts involved in Bayesian experimental design, and focus on describing some of the more commonly used Bayesian utility functions and methods for their estimation, as well as a number of algorithms that are used to search over the design space to find the Bayesian optimal design. We also discuss other computational strategies for further research in Bayesian optimal design.","Bayesian optimal design,decision theory,utility function,stochastic optimisation,posterior distribution approximation","EXPECTED INFORMATION GAINS,PARAMETER-ESTIMATION,CLINICAL-TRIALS,STOCHASTIC-APPROXIMATION,LAPLACE APPROXIMATIONS,SEQUENTIAL DESIGNS,DECISION-ANALYSIS,NONLINEAR MODELS,SAMPLING TIMES,LINEAR-MODELS","Ryan, Elizabeth G.@Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Math Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia@Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, Dept Biostat, London, England::Drovandi, Christopher C.@Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Math Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia@Queensland Univ Technol, ARC Ctr Excellence Math & Stat Frontiers, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia::McGree, James M.@Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Math Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia@Queensland Univ Technol, ARC Ctr Excellence Math & Stat Frontiers, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia::Pettitt, Anthony N.@Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Math Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia@Queensland Univ Technol, ARC Ctr Excellence Math & Stat Frontiers, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia","Ryan, Elizabeth G.@University of London@Kings College London@Queensland University of Technology (QUT)::Drovandi, Christopher C.@Queensland University of Technology (QUT)::McGree, James M.@Queensland University of Technology (QUT)::Pettitt, Anthony N.@Queensland University of Technology (QUT)","McGree, James@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2997-8929::Drovandi, Christopher@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9222-8763::Pettitt, Anthony@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4816-4595","Bayesian-optimal design via interacting particle systems+Amzal, B; Bois, FY; Parent, E; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2006::DT-optimum designs for model discrimination and parameter estimation+Atkinson, A.

Coarsened Propensity Scores and Hybrid Estimators for Missing Data and Causal Inference,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12082,DEC 2015,30,1,"In the areas of missing data and causal inference, there is great interest in doubly robust (DR) estimators that involve both an outcome regression (RG) model and a propensity score (PS) model. These DR estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal if either model is correctly specified. Despite their theoretical appeal, the practical utility of DR estimators has been disputed (e.g. Kang and Schaffer, Statistical Science 2007; 22: 523-539). One of the major concerns is the possibility of erratic estimates resulting from near-zero denominators due to extreme values of the estimated PS. In contrast, the usual RG estimator based on the RG model alone is efficient when the RG model is correct and generally more stable than the DR estimators, although it can be biased when the RG model is incorrect. In light of the unique advantages of the RG and DR estimators, we propose a class of hybrid estimators that attempt to strike a reasonable balance between the RG and DR estimators. These hybrid estimators are motivated by heuristic arguments that coarsened PS estimates are less likely to take extreme values and less sensitive to misspecification of the PS model than the original model-based PS estimates. The proposed estimators are compared with existing estimators in simulation studies and illustrated with real data from a large observational study on obstetric labour progression and birth outcomes.","Double robustness,inverse probability weighting,outcome regression,propensity score,stratification","DOUBLY ROBUST ESTIMATION,INCOMPLETE DATA,MODELS,EPIDEMIOLOGY,SMOKING,BIAS","Zhou, Jie@US FDA, Ctr Devices & Radiol Hlth, Off Surveillance & Biometr, Div Biostat, Silver Spring, MD 20993 USA::Zhang, Zhiwei@US FDA, Ctr Devices & Radiol Hlth, Off Surveillance & Biometr, Div Biostat, Silver Spring, MD 20993 USA::Li, Zhaohai@George Washington Univ, Dept Stat, Washington, DC 20052 USA::Zhang, Jun@Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, Xinhua Hosp, MOE, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China@Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, Xinhua Hosp, Shanghai Key Lab Childrens Environm Hlth, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China","Zhou, Jie@US Food & Drug Administration (FDA)::Zhang, Zhiwei@US Food & Drug Administration (FDA)::Li, Zhaohai@George Washington University::Zhang, Jun@Shanghai Jiao Tong University",not exist,"Perinatal complications associated with maternal tobacco use.+Andres, R L; Day, M C+Seminars in neonatology : SN+2000-Aug::Doubly robust estimation in missing data and causal inference models+Bang, H+BIOMETRICS+DEC 2005::Improving efficiency and robustness of the doubly robust estimator for a population mean with incomplete data+Cao, Weihua; Tsiatis, Anastasios A.; Davidian, Marie+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 2009::Effects of smoking during pregnancy - Five meta-analyses+Castles, A; Adams, EK; Melvin, CL; et al.+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE+APR 1999::Propensity score methods for bias reduction in the comparison of a treatment to a non-randomized control group+D'Agostino, RB+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+OCT 15 1998::Loss-based estimation with cross-validation: applications to microarray data analysis and motif finding+Dudoit, S.; van dersLaan, M.

A Conditional Approach to Measure Mortality Reductions Due to Cancer Screening,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12088,DEC 2015,36,2,"The prevailing lack of consensus about the comparative harms and benefits of cancer screening stems, in part, from the inappropriate calculations of the expected mortality impact of a sustained screening programme. There is an inherent, and often substantial, time lag from the time of screening until the resulting mortality reductions begin, reach their maximum and ultimately end. However, the cumulative mortality reduction reported in a randomised screening trial is typically calculated over an arbitrarily defined follow-up period, including follow-up time where the mortality impact is yet to realise or where it has already been exhausted. Because of this, the cumulative reduction cannot be used for projecting the mortality impact expected from a sustained screening programme. For this purpose, we propose a new measure, the time-specific probability of being helped by screening, given that the cancer would have proven fatal otherwise. This can be decomposed into round-specific impacts, which in turn can be parametrised and estimated from the trial data. This represents a major shift in quantifying the benefits due to a sustained screening programme, based on statistical evidence extracted from existing trial data. We illustrate our approach using data from screening trials in lung and colorectal cancers.","Cancer screening,conditional likelihood,early detection,randomised screening trial","EARLY-DETECTION PROGRAMS,BREAST-CANCER,COLORECTAL-CANCER,DISEASE,MODELS,TRIALS,MAMMOGRAPHY","Liu, Zhihui (Amy)@Canc Care Ontario, Toronto, ON, Canada@Univ Toronto, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Toronto, ON, Canada::Hanley, James A.@McGill Univ, Dept Epidemiol Biostat & Occupat Hlth, Montreal, PQ, Canada::Saarela, Olli@Univ Toronto, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Toronto, ON, Canada::Dendukuri, Nandini@McGill Univ, Dept Epidemiol Biostat & Occupat Hlth, Montreal, PQ, Canada","Liu, Zhihui (Amy)@University of Toronto@Cancer Care Ontario::Hanley, James A.@McGill University::Saarela, Olli@University of Toronto::Dendukuri, Nandini@McGill University",not exist,"An introduction to survival and event history analysis+Aalen, Odd O.; Borgan, Ornulf; Gjessing, Hakon K.+SURVIVAL AND EVENT HISTORY ANALYSIS: A PROCESS POINT OF VIEW+2008::Reduced Lung-Cancer Mortality with Low-Dose Computed Tomographic Screening+Aberle, Denise R.; Adams, Amanda M.; Berg, Christine D.; et al.+NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE+AUG 4 2011::Identification of causal effects using instrumental variables+Angrist, JD; Imbens, GW; Rubin, DB+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1996::The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care.

It is concerned mainly with the period from 1954 (when the first electronic computer was delivered) until 1985 (when this article was written). Initially, many specialised programs were written, but it was soon realised that, for efficiency, general-purpose programseach unifying many statistical techniqueswere required. The development of these programs was gradual and required corresponding developments in statistical theory. Now, the bulk of statistical work, not only for Rothamsted but also for the Agricultural and Food Research Service (AFRS) as a whole, is covered by a few programs, notably Genstat that has an international market.

Approximate Bayesian Computation for a Class of Time Series Models,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12089,DEC 2015,85,7,"In the following article, we consider approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) for certain classes of time series models. In particular, we focus upon scenarios where the likelihoods of the observations and parameter are intractable, by which we mean that one cannot evaluate the likelihood even up to a non-negative unbiased estimate. This paper reviews and develops a class of approximation procedures based upon the idea of ABC, but specifically maintains the probabilistic structure of the original statistical model. This latter idea is useful, in that one can adopt or adapt established computational methods for statistical inference.

"Big Data, Official Statistics and Some Initiatives by the Australian Bureau ofStatistics",INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12105,DEC 2015,28,8,"Official statisticians have been dealing with a diversity of data sources for decades. However, new sources of data in the Big Data domain provide an opportunity to deliver a more efficient and effective statistical service. This paper outlines a number of considerations for the official statistician when deciding whether to embrace a particular new data source in the regular production of official statistics. The principal considerations are relevance, business benefit, and the validity of using the source for official statistics in finite population inferences or analytic inferences. The paper also describes the Big Data Flagship Project of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), which has been established to provide the opportunity for the ABS to gain practical experience in assessing the business, statistical, technical, computational and other issues in using Big Data. In addition, ABS participation in national and international activities in this area will help it share experience and knowledge, while collaboration with academics will enable ABS to better acquire the capability to address business problems using the new sources of data as part of the solution.","Data Quality Framework,privacy,public good,validity of statistical inferences",,"Tam, Siu-Ming@Australian Bur Stat, Methodol & Data Management Div, Belconnen, ACT 2615, Australia::Clarke, Frederic@Australian Bur Stat, Methodol & Data Management Div, Belconnen, ACT 2615, Australia","Tam, Siu-Ming@Unknow::Clarke, Frederic@Unknow",not exist,"Big data and official statistics+no author+ABS Ann.

Using the Fraction of Missing Information to Identify Auxiliary Variables for Imputation Procedures via Proxy Pattern-mixture Models,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12091,DEC 2015,34,6,"In many surveys, imputation procedures are used to account for non-response bias induced by either unit non-response or item non-response. Such procedures are optimised (in terms of reducing non-response bias) when the models include covariates that are highly predictive of both response and outcome variables. To achieve this, we propose a method for selecting sets of covariates used in regression imputation models or to determine imputation cells for one or more outcome variables, using the fraction of missing information (FMI) as obtained via a proxy pattern-mixture (PMM) model as the key metric. In our variable selection approach, we use the PPM model to obtain a maximum likelihood estimate of the FMI for separate sets of candidate imputation models and look for the point at which changes in the FMI level off and further auxiliary variables do not improve the imputation model. We illustrate our proposed approach using empirical data from the Ohio Medicaid Assessment Survey and from the Service Annual Survey.","Maximum likelihood,fraction of missing information,imputation,proxy pattern-mixture models","NONRESPONSE BIAS,ADMINISTRATIVE DATA,INDICATORS,VECTORS","Andridge, Rebecca@Ohio State Univ, Coll Publ Hlth, Columbus, OH 43210 USA::Thompson, Katherine Jenny@US Census Bur, Off Stat Methods & Res Econ Programs, Washington, DC 20233 USA","Andridge, Rebecca@Ohio State University::Thompson, Katherine Jenny@Unknow","Andridge, Rebecca@C-8457-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9991-9647","no title+Andridge, R.

On Families of Distributions with Shape Parameters,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12055,AUG 2015,94,12,"Univariate continuous distributions are one of the fundamental components on which statistical modelling, ancient and modern, frequentist and Bayesian, multi-dimensional and complex, is based. In this article, I review and compare some of the main general techniques for providing families of typically unimodal distributions on R with one or two, or possibly even three, shape parameters, controlling skewness and/or tailweight, in addition to their all-important location and scale parameters. One important and useful family is comprised of the skew-symmetric' distributions brought to prominence by Azzalini. As these are covered in considerable detail elsewhere in the literature, I focus more on their complements and competitors. Principal among these are distributions formed by transforming random variables, by what I call transformation of scale'including two-piece distributionsand by probability integral transformation of non-uniform random variables. I also treat briefly the issues of multi-variate extension, of distributions on subsets of R and of distributions on the circle. The review and comparison is not comprehensive, necessarily being selective and therefore somewhat personal. (c) 2014The Authors.

Assessing Variability of Complex Descriptive Statistics in Monte Carlo Studies Using Resampling Methods,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12087,AUG 2015,16,1,"Good statistical practice dictates that summaries in Monte Carlo studies should always be accompanied by standard errors. Those standard errors are easy to provide for summaries that are sample means over the replications of the Monte Carlo output: for example, bias estimates, power estimates for tests and mean squared error estimates. But often more complex summaries are of interest: medians (often displayed in boxplots), sample variances, ratios of sample variances and non-normality measures such as skewness and kurtosis. In principle, standard errors for most of these latter summaries may be derived from the Delta Method, but that extra step is often a barrier for standard errors to be provided. Here, we highlight the simplicity of using the jackknife and bootstrap to compute these standard errors, even when the summaries are somewhat complicated.","Bootstrap,jackknife,coefficient of variation,delta method,influence curve,standard errors,variability of ratios","JACKKNIFE,BIAS","Boos, Dennis D.@N Carolina State Univ, Dept Stat, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA::Osborne, Jason A.@N Carolina State Univ, Dept Stat, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Boos, Dennis D.@North Carolina State University@University of North Carolina::Osborne, Jason A.@North Carolina State University@University of North Carolina",not exist,"NOTES AND PROBLEMS FINITE-SAMPLE MOMENTS OF THE COEFFICIENT OF VARIATION+Bao, Yong+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+FEB 2009::no title+Boos,, D.

Finding Bayesian Optimal Designs for Nonlinear Models: A Semidefinite Programming-Based Approach,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12073,AUG 2015,56,5,"This paper uses semidefinite programming (SDP) to construct Bayesian optimal design for nonlinear regression models. The setup here extends the formulation of the optimal designs problem as an SDP problem from linear to nonlinear models. Gaussian quadrature formulas (GQF) are used to compute the expectation in the Bayesian design criterion, such as D-, A- or E-optimality. As an illustrative example, we demonstrate the approach using the power-logistic model and compare results in the literature. Additionally, we investigate how the optimal design is impacted by different discretising schemes for the design space, different amounts of uncertainty in the parameter values, different choices of GQF and different prior distributions for the vector of model parameters, including normal priors with and without correlated components. Further applications to find Bayesian D-optimal designs with two regressors for a logistic model and a two-variable generalised linear model with a gamma distributed response are discussed, and some limitations of our approach are noted.","Approximate designs,semidefinite programming,Gaussian quadrature formulas,nonlinear models","SUPPORT-POINTS,REGRESSION,CONSTRUCTION,OPTIMIZATION,ALGORITHMS,VARIABLES,NUMBER","Duarte, Belmiro P.

Extreme Value Theory and Statistics of Univariate Extremes: A Review,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12058,AUG 2015,260,30,"Statistical issues arising in modelling univariate extremes of a random sample have been successfully used in the most diverse fields, such as biometrics, finance, insurance and risk theory. Statistics of univariate extremes (SUE), the subject to be dealt with in this review paper, has recently faced a huge development, partially because rare events can have catastrophic consequences for human activities, through their impact on the natural and constructed environments. In the last decades, there has been a shift from the area of parametric SUE, based on probabilistic asymptotic results in extreme value theory, towards semi-parametric approaches. After a brief reference to Gumbel's block methodology and more recent improvements in the parametric framework, we present an overview of the developments on the estimation of parameters of extreme events and on the testing of extreme value conditions under a semi-parametric framework. We further discuss a few challenging topics in the area of SUE. (c) 2014The Authors.

On Some Principles of Statistical Inference,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12067,AUG 2015,65,5,"Statistical theory aims to provide a foundation for studying the collection and interpretation of data, a foundation that does not depend on the particular details of the substantive field in which the data are being considered. This gives a systematic way to approach new problems, and a common language for summarising results; ideally, the foundations and common language ensure that statistical aspects of one study, or of several studies on closely related phenomena, can be broadly accessible. We discuss some principles of statistical inference, to outline how these are, or could be, used to inform the interpretation of results, and to provide a greater degree of coherence for the foundations of statistics.","Ancillary,Bayesian,conditional,likelihood,models,p-values,sufficient","HIGHER-ORDER ASYMPTOTICS,CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS,EXPONENTIAL-FAMILIES,TAIL PROBABILITIES,LIKELIHOOD,BAYES,DISTRIBUTIONS,FREQUENTIST,PARAMETERS,POINTS","Reid, Nancy@Univ Toronto, Dept Stat, Toronto, ON, Canada::Cox, David R.@Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford OX1 1NF, England","Reid, Nancy@University of Toronto::Cox, David R.@University of Oxford",not exist,"On the minimal sufficiency of the likelihood function+Barndorff-Nielsen, O.; Hoffmann-Jorgensen, J.; Pedersen, K.+Scandinavian Journal of Statistics Theory and Applications+1976::no title+Barndorff-Nielsen, O.

On Pooling of Data and Its Relative Efficiency,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12070,AUG 2015,17,0,"Pooling of data is often carried out to protect privacy or to save cost, with the claimed advantage that it does not lead to much loss of efficiency. We argue that this does not give the complete picture as the estimation of different parameters is affected to different degrees by pooling. We establish a ladder of efficiency loss for estimating the mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis, and more generally multivariate joint cumulants, in powers of the pool size. The asymptotic efficiency of the pooled data non-parametric/parametric maximum likelihood estimator relative to the corresponding unpooled data estimator is reduced by a factor equal to the pool size whenever the order of the cumulant to be estimated is increased by one. The implications of this result are demonstrated in case-control genetic association studies with interactions between genes. Our findings provide a guideline for the discriminate use of data pooling in practice and the assessment of its relative efficiency. As exact maximum likelihood estimates are difficult to obtain if the pool size is large, we address briefly how to obtain computationally efficient estimates from pooled data and suggest Gaussian estimation and non-parametric maximum likelihood as two feasible methods.","Asymptotic relative efficiency,case-control study,Gaussian estimation,haplotype frequency estimation,interaction between genes,lattice theory,non-parametric maximum likelihood","LARGE-SCALE ASSOCIATION,DNA,PREVALENCE,DISEASE,TOOL","Xu, Jinfeng@NYU, New York, NY 10012 USA::Kuk, Anthony@Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore 117548, Singapore","Xu, Jinfeng@New York University::Kuk, Anthony@National University of Singapore","Xu, Jinfeng@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3165-2015","no title+BARNDORFFNIELSE.OE+ASYMPTOTIC TECHNIQUE+1989::GAUSSIAN ESTIMATION FOR CORRELATED BINOMIAL DATA+CROWDER, M+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1985::On repeated measures analysis with misspecified covariance structure+Crowder, M+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2001::The detection of defective members of large populations+Dorfmans, R.+Ann.

Varying Coefficient Regression Models: A Review and New Developments,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12029,APR 2015,76,15,"Varying coefficient regression models are known to be very useful tools for analysing the relation between a response and a group of covariates. Their structure and interpretability are similar to those for the traditional linear regression model, but they are more flexible because of the infinite dimensionality of the corresponding parameter spaces. The aims of this paper are to give an overview on the existing methodological and theoretical developments for varying coefficient models and to discuss their extensions with some new developments. The new developments enable us to use different amount of smoothing for estimating different component functions in the models. They are for a flexible form of varying coefficient models that requires smoothing across different covariates' spaces and are based on the smooth backfitting technique that is admitted as a powerful technique for fitting structural regression models and is also known to free us from the curse of dimensionality.","Varying coefficient models,kernel smoothing,sieve estimation,penalised likelihood methods,partially linear models,longitudinal data,projection,quasi-likelihood,integral equation,shrinkage estimation,robust estimation","DIFFERENT SMOOTHING VARIABLES,PARTIALLY LINEAR-MODELS,NONCONCAVE PENALIZED LIKELIHOOD,POLYNOMIAL SPLINE ESTIMATION,NONLINEAR TIME-SERIES,LONGITUDINAL DATA,ADDITIVE-MODELS,EFFICIENT ESTIMATION,QUANTILE REGRESSION,BANDWIDTH SELECTION","Park, Byeong U.@Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul, South Korea::Mammen, Enno@Univ Mannheim, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany::Lee, Young K.@Kangwon Natl Univ, Chunchon, South Korea::Lee, Eun Ryung@Univ Mannheim, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany","Park, Byeong U.@Seoul National University::Mammen, Enno@University of Mannheim::Lee, Young K.@Kangwon National University::Lee, Eun Ryung@University of Mannheim",not exist,"Efficient estimation of a semiparametric partially linear varying coefficient model+Ahmad, I; Leelahanon, S; Li, Q+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 2005::MULTIVARIATE BINARY DISCRIMINATION BY KERNEL METHOD+AITCHISON, J; AITKEN, CGG+BIOMETRIKA+1976::ESTIMATING OPTIMAL TRANSFORMATIONS FOR MULTIPLE-REGRESSION AND CORRELATION+BREIMAN, L; FRIEDMAN, JH+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1985::Two-step likelihood estimation procedure for varying-coefficient models+Cai, ZW+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+JUL 2002::Efficient estimation and inferences for varying-coefficient models+Cai, ZW; Fan, JQ; Li, RZ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2000::Functional-coefficient regression models for nonlinear time series+Cai, ZW; Fan, JQ; Yao, QW+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2000::FUNCTIONAL-COEFFICIENT AUTOREGRESSIVE MODELS+CHEN, R; TSAY, RS+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::Large sample sieve estimation of semi-nonparametric models+Chen, X.+HDB ECONOMETRICS B+2007::A Sparse Structured Shrinkage Estimator for Nonparametric Varying-Coefficient Model With an Application in Genomics+Daye, Z.

A Conversation with Jean-Louis Bodin,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12081,APR 2015,17,0,"Jean-Louis Bodin has had a distinguished career as an official statistician in the French and European statistical systems, where he has been working for 40years.Born in 1941 in Bordeaux, the capital city of one of the most famous vineyards in the world, he became graduate of two French prestigious schools, the Ecole Polytechnique in 1963, then the ENSAE (Ecole Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Administration Economique) in 1966. After having spent 20years in different positions in the French Statistical System, he dedicated the last 20years of his career to international relations in official statistics and cooperation for strengthening statistical capacities of transition and developing countries. In particular, he was one of the main drafters of the UN Resolution on Fundamental Principles for Official Statistics and of the African Statistical Charter. He is also known for having created AFRISTAT, the Economic and Statistical Observatory of Sub-Saharan African countries. He was also during years one of the French representatives in the UN Statistical Commission, the UN Conference of European Statisticians and the Statistical Committee Programme of the European Union.Jean-Louis Bodin has played for 40years a very active role in national and international statistical societies. He served on many disparate positions in the ISI family: executive director of the International Association of Survey Statisticians from 1981 to 1985 under the successive chairmanships of Gerard Theodore and Leslie Kish, founding member in 1985 with Vera Nyitrai of the International Association for Official Statistics and president of the Association from 1989 to 1991, secretary-general of the National Organizing Committee of the 47th ISI Session held in Paris in August 1989, Chair of the Programme Coordinating Committee of the 50th ISI Session held in Beijing in August 1995, ISI president-elect then president from 1997 to 2001, president of the Jury of the Mahalanobis Prize from 2002 to 2005. He was also president of the Societe de Statistique de Paris in 1994. He received the certificate of Fellow of the American Statistical Association in 1996 and was a member of the ASA Committee for International Relations in Statistics from 1993 to 1997.He was bestowed in 2006 as a Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur (Knight of the Legion of Honour) in France and in 1997 as a Kawaleski Orderu Zasugi(Knight of the Order of Merit) in Poland. He received the Medal of Statistical Merit in Vietnam in 2003 and the African Statistical Award bestowed by the UN Economic Conference for Africa in 2012.This conversation was held in June 2013 with Gilbert Saporta in Paris.Gilbert Saporta: Welcome to this interview, Jean-Louis. I'm delighted that you could spend some time with me to discuss your career, your achievements and your views on some aspects of official statistics. It appears that your professional career as a French official statistician and your participation in ISI activities were tightly linked. <boxed-text content-type=""graphic"" position=""anchor""> <graphic xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""urn:x-wiley:0306-7734:media:insr12081:insr12081-gra-0001"">image</graphic","Official statistical systems,European statistics,ethics and good practices,international cooperation,strengthening statistical capacities",,"Saporta, Gilbert@Conservatoire Natl Arts & Metiers, Dept Ingn Math, F-75003 Paris, France@Conservatoire Natl Arts & Metiers, CEDRIC Lab, F-75003 Paris, France","Saporta, Gilbert@Conservatoire National Arts & Metiers (CNAM)@heSam Universite",not exist,"no title+no author+ETHICALGUIDELINES FOR STATISTICAL PRACTICE+1999::Recent developments in price and related statistics in Argentina+Berumen, E.; Beker, V.+Stat.

"Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz-Statistician, Economist and a European Intellectual",INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12083,APR 2015,46,2,"Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz (1868-1931) was a European statistician. His scientific work covered theoretical economics, stochastics, mathematical statistics and radiology; today, we would call him a cross-disciplinary scientist. With his clear views on mathematical principles with their applications in these fields, he stood in conflict with the mainstream economic schools in Germany at the dawn of the 20th century. He had many prominent students (Gumbel, Leontief and Freudenberg among them), and he carved out the path of modern statistical thinking. He was a true European intellectual with a career path from St. Petersburg via Gottingen to Stra ss burg and finally the Berliner Universitat, now Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin. He is known for the precise calibration of insurance claims applying theat that time hardly knownPoisson distribution to Prussian horse kick and child suicide data. He proposed a simple solution to the Marxian transformation problem and wrote numerous articles and books on the mathematical treatment of statistical (including radiological physical) data. In this article, we sketch his life and work and point out the prominent role that he has in today's statistical thinking.","History of science,statistics,horse kicks,Bortkiewicz",,"Haerdle, Wolfgang Karl@Humboldt Univ, CASE Ctr Appl Stat & Econ, Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz Chair Stat, D-10099 Berlin, Germany@Singapore Management Univ, Lee Kong Chian Sch Business, Singapore 178902, Singapore::Vogt, Annette B.@Max Planck Inst Hist Sci, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Haerdle, Wolfgang Karl@Humboldt University of Berlin@Singapore Management University::Vogt, Annette B.@Max Planck Society",not exist,"Uber die Anwendung der Differenzenmethode bei Reihenaus-gleichungen, Stabilitatsuntersuchungen und Korrelationsmessungen+Anderson, O.+Biometrika+1926::no title+Anderson, O.+Einfuhrung in die mathematische Statistik+1935::no title+Anderson, O.; Andersson, Th.; Gumbel, E.

Statistical Approaches for Non-parametric Frontier Models: A Guided Tour,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12056,APR 2015,137,24,"A rich theory of production and analysis of productive efficiency has developed since the pioneering work by Tjalling C. Koopmans and Gerard Debreu. Michael J. Farrell published the first empirical study, and it appeared in a statistical journal (Journal of the Royal Statistical Society), even though the article provided no statistical theory. The literature in econometrics, management sciences, operations research and mathematical statistics has since been enriched by hundreds of papers trying to develop or implement new tools for analysing productivity and efficiency of firms. Both parametric and non-parametric approaches have been proposed. The mathematical challenge is to derive estimators of production, cost, revenue or profit frontiers, which represent, in the case of production frontiers, the optimal loci of combinations of inputs (like labour, energy and capital) and outputs (the products or services produced by the firms). Optimality is defined in terms of various economic considerations. Then the efficiency of a particular unit is measured by its distance to the estimated frontier. The statistical problem can be viewed as the problem of estimating the support of a multivariate random variable, subject to some shape constraints, in multiple dimensions. These techniques are applied in thousands of papers in the economic and business literature. This guided tour' reviews the development of various non-parametric approaches since the early work of Farrell. Remaining challenges and open issues in this challenging arena are also described.

Statistical Issues in Assessing Forensic Evidence,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12069,APR 2015,43,2,"In 2009, the National Academy of Sciences released a report that emphasized the need for more scientific research in the evaluation of methods in the forensic science disciplines. This needed research includes statistical issues such as bias quantification, validation and estimates of accuracy and precision in different contexts. This article reviews statistical aspects of forensic science with particular reference to the design of studies that are essential to evaluate inferences from forensic evidence. Many sources can affect both the accuracy and the consistency of decisions at each stage of the process, from specimen collection to final decision. The article discusses the importance of identifying these sources and the statistical principles involved in the quantification of, and uncertainty in, estimated probabilities of error. By contrasting the design of a successful community clinical trial with two previous fingerprint studies and with bullet lead studies, this article emphasizes the need for reduced subjectivity, the types of measurements on physical evidence that can lead to more accurate and consistent decisions and the importance of carefully designed studies in the evaluation of forensic evidence.","Designed experiment,variability,bias,error rates,sensitivity,specificity,positive/negative predictive value,confidence interval,fingerprints,DNA analysis","DNA PROFILES,PROBABILITIES","Kafadar, Karen@Univ Virginia, Dept Stat, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA","Kafadar, Karen@University of Virginia",not exist,"no title+Armitages, P.+STAT METHODS MED RES+1971::CONTROLLING THE FALSE DISCOVERY RATE - A PRACTICAL AND POWERFUL APPROACH TO MULTIPLE TESTING+BENJAMINI, Y; HOCHBERG, Y+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1995::Visualization of latent fingerprint corrosion of metallic surfaces+Bond, John W.+JOURNAL OF FORENSIC SCIENCES+JUL 2008::Partial matches in heterogeneous offender databases do not call into question the validity of random match probability calculations+Budowle, Bruce; Baechtel, F.

Applications of Statistics in the Field of General Insurance: An Overview,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12066,APR 2015,48,1,"This is an expository paper on applications of statistics in the field of general insurance, also called non-life insurance. Unlike life insurance where advanced statistical techniques have long been part of financial mathematics and actuarial applications, their use is only relatively recent in non-life insurance. The business model of insurance companies, especially those active in non-life insurance, has seen dramatic changes over the last 15years. The aim of this paper is to convince the readers that especially today non-life insurance is not only an exciting ground to apply existing modern statistical tools but also a fertile environment for new and challenging statistical developments. The activities of an insurance company can be viewed as an industrial process where data management and data analysis play a key role. That is why a fundamental understanding of data-related issues (such as data quality, variability, analysis and correct interpretation) is so essential to the insurance business. These are exactly the tasks where professional statisticians excel. Also, a better understanding of the field of general insurance by statisticians will promote fruitful exchanges between actuaries and statisticians, thereby helping to bring actuarial and statistical professional societies closer to each other. Selected examples are used to cover the essential aspects of general insurance, and all of them are based on the author's experience.

Fifty Years of Classification and Regression Trees,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12016,DEC 2014,144,49,"Fifty years have passed since the publication of the first regression tree algorithm. New techniques have added capabilities that far surpass those of the early methods. Modern classification trees can partition the data with linear splits on subsets of variables and fit nearest neighbor, kernel density, and other models in the partitions. Regression trees can fit almost every kind of traditional statistical model, including least-squares, quantile, logistic, Poisson, and proportional hazards models, as well as models for longitudinal and multiresponse data. Greater availability and affordability of software (much of which is free) have played a significant role in helping the techniques gain acceptance and popularity in the broader scientific community. This article surveys the developments and briefly reviews the key ideas behind some of the major algorithms.","Classification trees,regression trees,machine learning,prediction","CENSORED SURVIVAL-DATA,OMNIVARIATE DECISION TREES,MULTIVARIATE REGRESSION,LOGISTIC-REGRESSION,VARIABLE IMPORTANCE,LONGITUDINAL DATA,SPLIT SELECTION,PATTERN CLASSIFICATION,RECURSIVE PARTITION,ENSEMBLE METHODS","Loh, Wei-Yin@Univ Wisconsin, Dept Stat, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Loh, Wei-Yin@University of Wisconsin Madison@University of Wisconsin System",not exist,"NONPARAMETRIC INFERENCE FOR A FAMILY OF COUNTING PROCESSES+AALEN, O+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1978::Binary partitioning for continuous longitudinal data: categorizing a prognostic variable+Abdolell, M; LeBlanc, M; Stephens, D; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+NOV 30 2002::TREE-STRUCTURED EXPONENTIAL REGRESSION MODELING+AHN, H+BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL+1994::Tree-structured logistic model for over-dispersed binomial data with application to modeling developmental effects+Ahn, H; Chen, JJ+BIOMETRICS+JUN 1997::TREE-STRUCTURED PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS REGRESSION MODELING+AHN, HS; LOH, WY+BIOMETRICS+JUN 1994::Log-gamma regression modeling through regression trees+Ahn, HS+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1996::TREE-STRUCTURED EXTREME-VALUE MODEL REGRESSION+AHN, HS+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1994::Log-normal regression modeling through recursive partitioning+Ahn, HS+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+APR 1996::Knowledge discovery in data streams with regression tree methods+Alberg, Dima; Last, Mark; Kandel, Abraham+WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY+JAN-FEB 2012::no title+Atkinson, B; Therneau, T; Ripley, B.+rpart: Recursive Partitioning and Regression Trees.+2011::Survival trees with time-dependent covariates: application to estimating changes in the incubation period of AIDS.+Bacchetti, P; Segal, M R+Lifetime data analysis+1995::no title+Bishop, YM; Fienberg, SE; Holland, PW.+Discrete Multivariate Analysis - Theory and Practice+1975::no title+Breiman, L.+Classification and regression trees+1984::Random forests+Breiman, L+MACHINE LEARNING+OCT 2001::Bagging predictors+Breiman, L+MACHINE LEARNING+AUG 1996::Classification trees with optimal multivariate decision nodes+Brown, DE; Pittard, CL; Park, H+PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS+JUN 10 1996::LINEAR-REGRESSION WITH CENSORED DATA+BUCKLEY, J; JAMES, I+BIOMETRIKA+1979::Using k-nearest-neighbor classification in the leaves of a tree+Buttrey, SE; Karo, C+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JUL 28 2002::LOTUS: An algorithm for building accurate and comprehensible logistic regression trees+Chan, KY; Loh, WY+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+DEC 2004::Nonparametric estimation of conditional quantiles using quantile regression trees+Chaudhuri, P; Loh, WY+BERNOULLI+OCT 2002::GENERALIZED REGRESSION TREES+CHAUDHURI, P; LO, WD; LOH, WY; et al.+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 1995::PIECEWISE-POLYNOMIAL REGRESSION TREES+CHAUDHURI, P; HUANG, MC; LOH, WY; et al.+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 1994::Bayesian CART model search+Chipman, HA; George, EI; McCulloch, RE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1998::Bayesian treed models+Chipman, HA; George, EI; McCulloch, RE+MACHINE LEARNING+JUL-SEP 2002::Median regression tree for analysis of censored survival data+Cho, Hyung Jun; Hong, Seung-Mo+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART A-SYSTEMS AND HUMANS+MAY 2008::Regression trees for analysis of count data with extra Poisson variation+Choi, Y; Ahn, H; Chen, JJ+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JUN 1 2005::OPTIMAL PARTITIONING FOR CLASSIFICATION AND REGRESSION TREES+CHOU, PA+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE+APR 1991::GENERALIZED REGRESSION TREES+CIAMPI, A+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+AUG 1991::STRATIFICATION BY STEPWISE REGRESSION, CORRESPONDENCE-ANALYSIS AND RECURSIVE PARTITION - A COMPARISON OF 3 METHODS OF ANALYSIS FOR SURVIVAL-DATA WITH COVARIATES+CIAMPI, A; THIFFAULT, J; NAKACHE, JP; et al.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+OCT 1986::RECPAM - A COMPUTER-PROGRAM FOR RECURSIVE PARTITION AND AMALGAMATION FOR CENSORED SURVIVAL-DATA AND OTHER SITUATIONS FREQUENTLY OCCURRING IN BIOSTATISTICS .1.

Disclosure-protected Inference Using Generalised Linear Models,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12054,DEC 2014,32,3,"Vast amounts of data that could be used in the development and evaluation of policy for the benefit of society are collected by statistical agencies. It is therefore no surprise that there is very strong demand from analysts, within business, government, universities and other organisations, to access such data. When allowing access to micro-data, a statistical agency is obliged, often legally, to ensure that it is unlikely to result in the disclosure of information about a particular person or organisation. Managing the risk of disclosure is referred to as statistical disclosure control (SDC). This paper describes an approach to SDC for output from analysis using generalised linear models, including estimates of regression parameters and their variances, diagnostic statistics and plots. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has implemented the approach in a remote analysis system, which returns analysis output from remotely submitted queries. A framework for measuring disclosure risk associated with a remote server is proposed. The disclosure risk and utility of approach are measured in two real-life case studies and in simulation.","Confidentiality,disclosure risk,remote analysis,statistical disclosure control","ACCESS,REGRESSION,SERVERS,DIAGNOSTICS,RISK","Chipperfield, James O.@Australian Bur Stat, Canberra, ACT 2617, Australia::O'Keefe, Christine M.@CSIRO Computat Informat, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Chipperfield, James O.@Unknow::O'Keefe, Christine M.@Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)","O'Keefe, Christine@A-5945-2009@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8193-7820","Remote Data Access and the Risk of Disclosure from Linear Regression: An Empirical Study+Bleninger, Philipp; Drechsler, Joerg; Ronning, Gerd+PRIVACY IN STATISTICAL DATABASES+2010::Guidelines for the checking of outputs based on microdata research+Brandt, M.; Franconi, L.; Gurke, C.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Hundepool, A.; Lucarelli, M; Mol, J.; Welpton, R</span>.+ESSnet SDC, A Network of Excellence in the European Statistical System in the Field of Statistical Disclosure Control+2010::no title+Carroll, R.

Combining Probability Distributions by Multiplication in Metrology: A Viable Method?,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12034,DEC 2014,29,2,"In measurement science quite often the value of a so-called 'output quantity' is inferred from information about 'input quantities' with the help of the 'mathematical model of measurement'. The latter represents the functional relation through which outputs and inputs depend on one another. However, subsets of functionally independent quantities can always be so defined that they suffice to express the entire information available. Reporting information in terms of such a subset may in certain circumstances require aggregating probability distributions whose arguments are interrelated quantities. The option of aggregating by multiplication of distributions is shown to be susceptible of yielding inconsistent results when the roles of inputs and outputs are assigned differently to the quantities. Two alternatives to this practice that do not give rise to such discrepancies are discussed, namely (i) logarithmic pooling with weights summing to one and (ii) linear pooling, of which the former appears to be slightly more favourable for applications in metrology. An example illustrates the inconsistency of results obtained by distinct ways of multiplying distributions and the manner in which these results differ from a logarithmically pooled distribution.","Measurement uncertainty,Borel's paradox,data fusion,logarithmic pooling,linear pooling,change of variable,distributive property","POPULATION-DYNAMICS MODEL,BOWHEAD WHALES,OPINION POOLS,UNCERTAINTY,INFERENCE","Grientschnig, Dieter@Boehler Edelstahl, Chem Labs, A-8605 Kapfenberg, Austria::Lira, Ignacio@Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Mech & Met Engn, Santiago, Chile","Grientschnig, Dieter@Unknow::Lira, Ignacio@Pontificia Universidad  Catolica de Chile",not exist,"PROCEDURE FOR HIGH PRECISION DENSITY DETERMINATIONS BY HYDROSTATIC WEIGHING+BOWMAN, HA; SCHOONOV.RM+JOURNAL OF RESEARCH OF THE NATIONAL BUREAU OF STANDARDS SECTION C-ENGINEERING AND INSTRUMENTATION+1967::An appraisal of Bayesian synthesis, with suggested modifications and diagnostics+Bravington, M.V.+Forty-Sixth Report of the International Whaling Commission+1996::Aggregating Probability Distributions+Clemen, Robert T.; Winkler, Robert L.+ADVANCES IN DECISION ANALYSIS: FROM FOUNDATIONS TO APPLICATIONS+2007::Combining probability distributions from experts in risk analysis+Clemen, RT; Winkler, RL+RISK ANALYSIS+APR 1999::Statistical Models+Davison, A.C.+CAMBRIDGE SERIES STA+2003::Bayesian uncertainty analysis under prior ignorance of the measurand versus analysis using the Supplement 1 to the Guide: a comparison+Elster, Clemens; Toman, Blaza+METROLOGIA+JUN 2009::Calculation of uncertainty in the presence of prior knowledge+Elster, Clemens+METROLOGIA+APR 2007::A CHARACTERIZATION THEOREM FOR EXTERNALLY BAYESIAN GROUPS+GENEST, C+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1984::Combining probability distributions: A critique and annotated bibliography+Genest, C.; Zidek, J.+Statistical Science+1986::no title+no author+CRC HDB CHEM PHYS+2012::Selecting weighting factors in logarithmic opinion pools+Heskes, T+ADVANCES IN NEURAL INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS 10+1998::no title+Jaynes, Edwin T.+Probability Theory: The Logic of Science+2003::Evaluation of Measurement Data-Supplement 1 to the `Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement'-Propagation of distributions using a Monte Carlo method+no author+JCGM 101+2008::no title+no author+JCGM 200+2012::Evaluation of Measurement Data - Supplement 2 to the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement - Extension to any Number of Output Quantities+no author+102 JCGM+2011::Bayesian evaluation of the standard uncertainty and coverage probability in a simple measurement model+Lira, I; Woger, W+MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY+AUG 2001::A Formalism for Expressing the Probability Density Functions of Interrelated Quantities+Lira, I.; Grientschnig, D.+MEASUREMENT SCIENCE REVIEW+2013::Equivalence of alternative Bayesian procedures for evaluating measurement uncertainty+Lira, I.; Grientschnig, D.+METROLOGIA+JUN 2010::Bayesian assessment of uncertainty in metrology: a tutorial+Lira, I.; Grientschnig, D.+METROLOGIA+JUN 2010::On the long-run success rate of coverage intervals+Lira, I.+METROLOGIA+AUG 2008::MARGINALIZATION AND LINEAR OPINION POOLS+MCCONWAY, KJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1981::Inference for deterministic simulation models: The Bayesian melding approach+Poole, D; Raftery, AE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2000::Inference for Deterministic Simulation Models: the Bayesian melding approach+Poole, D.; Raftery, A.

"Akaike's Information Criterion, C-p and Estimators of Loss for Elliptically Symmetric Distributions",INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12052,DEC 2014,36,10,"In this article, we develop a modern perspective on Akaike's information criterion and Mallows's Cp for model selection, and propose generalisations to spherically and elliptically symmetric distributions. Despite the differences in their respective motivation, Cp and Akaike's information criterion are equivalent in the special case of Gaussian linear regression. In this case, they are also equivalent to a third criterion, an unbiased estimator of the quadratic prediction loss, derived from loss estimation theory. We then show that the form of the unbiased estimator of the quadratic prediction loss under a Gaussian assumption still holds under a more general distributional assumption, the family of spherically symmetric distributions. One of the features of our results is that our criterion does not rely on the specificity of the distribution, but only on its spherical symmetry. The same kind of criterion can be derived for a family of elliptically contoured distribution, which allows correlations, when considering the invariant loss. More specifically, the unbiasedness property is relative to a distribution associated to the original density.","Variable selection,loss estimation,unbiasedness,SURE,Stein identity,spherically and elliptically symmetric distributions","GENERAL LINEAR-MODEL,SHRINKAGE ESTIMATORS,CONTOURED DISTRIBUTION,ROBUST IMPROVEMENT,COVARIANCE-MATRIX,CROSS-VALIDATION,REGRESSION,SELECTION,PARAMETER","Boisbunon, Aurelie@Univ Rouen, Normandie Univ, LITIS EA 4108, Ave UnivBP 12, F-76801 St Etienne Du Rouvray, France::Canu, Stephane@Normandie Univ, INSA Rouen, LITIS EA 4108, F-76801 St Etienne Du Rouvray, France::Fourdrinier, Dominique@Univ Rouen, Normandie Univ, LITIS EA 4108, Ave UnivBP 12, F-76801 St Etienne Du Rouvray, France@Cornell Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Ithaca, NY USA::Strawderman, William@Rutgers State Univ, Dept Stat, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA::Wells, Martin T.@Cornell Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Ithaca, NY USA","Boisbunon, Aurelie@University of Rouen::Canu, Stephane@Unknow::Fourdrinier, Dominique@Cornell University@University of Rouen::Strawderman, William@Rutgers State University New Brunswick::Wells, Martin T.@Cornell University",not exist,"NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::A survey of cross-validation procedures for model selection+Arlot, S; Celisse, A.+Stat Surv+2010::SHRINKAGE ESTIMATORS UNDER SPHERICAL-SYMMETRY FOR THE GENERAL LINEAR-MODEL+CELLIER, D; FOURDRINIER, D+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+FEB 1995::ROBUST SHRINKAGE ESTIMATORS OF THE LOCATION PARAMETER FOR ELLIPTICALLY SYMMETRIC DISTRIBUTIONS+CELLIER, D; FOURDRINIER, D; ROBERT, C+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+APR 1989::Comparison of model selection for regression+Cherkassky, V; Ma, YQ+NEURAL COMPUTATION+JUL 2003::ELLIPTICALLY SYMMETRIC DISTRIBUTIONS - A REVIEW AND BIBLIOGRAPHY+CHMIELEWSKI, MA+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+1981::Estimation optimality of corrected AIC and modified Cp in linear regression+Daviesl, Simon L.; Neath, Andrew A.; Cavanaugh, Joseph E.+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+AUG 2006::The estimation of prediction error: Covariance penalties and cross-validation+Efron, B+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2004::Inadmissibility of sample mean and regression coefficients for elliptically contoured distributions+Fan, J.Q.; Fang, K.T.+Northeastern Math.

Local Powers of Optimal One-sample and Multi-sample Tests for the Concentration of Fisher-von Mises-Langevin Distributions,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12047,DEC 2014,26,5,"One-sample and multi-sample tests on the concentration parameter of Fisher-von Mises-Langevin distributions on (hyper-) spheres have been well studied in the literature. However, only little is known about their behaviour under local alternatives, which is due to complications inherent to the curved nature of the parameter space. The aim of the present paper therefore consists in filling that gap by having recourse to the Le Cam methodology, which has recently been adapted from the linear to the spherical setup. We obtain explicit expressions of the powers for the most efficient one-andmulti-sample tests. As a nice by-product, we are also able to write down the powers (against local Fisher-von Mises-Langevin alternatives) of the celebrated Rayleigh test of uniformity. A Monte Carlo simulation study confirms our theoretical findings and shows the empirical powers of the above-mentioned procedures.","Concentration parameter,directional statistics,Fisher-von Mises-Langevin distributions,Le Cam's third lemma,uniform local asymptotic normality",IMPROVED LIKELIHOOD RATIO,"Ley, Christophe@Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, Dept Math, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium::Verdebout, Thomas@Univ Lille 3, INRIA, EQUIPPE, F-59653 Villeneuve Dascq, France","Ley, Christophe@Universite Libre de Bruxelles::Verdebout, Thomas@Inria@Universite Lille-Nord-de-France (ComUE)@Fondation I-SITE ULNE@Universite de Lille",not exist,"Graphical models and directional statistics capture protein structure+Boomsma, W.; Kent, J.T.; Mardia, K.V.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Taylor, C.C.; Hamelryck, T</span>.+ANN LASR 2006 P+2006::Maximum likelihood characterization of rotationally symmetric distributions on the sphere+Duerinckx, Mitia; Ley, Christophe+SANKHYA-SERIES A-MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS AND PROBABILITY+AUG 2012::DISPERSION ON A SPHERE+FISHER, R+PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON SERIES A-MATHEMATICAL AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES+1953::no title+Gauss, CF.+Theoria motus corporum coelestium in sectionibus conicis.

Small-scale Inference: Empirical Bayes and Confidence Methods for as Few as a Single Comparison,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12064,DEC 2014,81,2,"Empirical Bayes methods of estimating the local false discovery rate (LFDR) by maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), originally developed for large numbers of comparisons, are applied to a single comparison. Specifically, when assuming a lower bound on the mixing proportion of true null hypotheses, the LFDR MLE can yield reliable hypothesis tests and confidence intervals given as few as one comparison. Simulations indicate that constrained LFDR MLEs perform markedly better than conventional methods, both in testing and in confidence intervals, for high values of the mixing proportion, but not for low values. (A decision-theoretic interpretation of the confidence distribution made those comparisons possible.) In conclusion, the constrained LFDR estimators and the resulting effect-size interval estimates are not only effective multiple comparison procedures but also they might replace p-values and confidence intervals more generally. The new methodology is illustrated with the analysis of proteomics data.","Confidence distribution,constrained maximum likelihood estimation,empirical Bayes,foundations of statistics,Lindley's paradox,local false discovery rate,multiple comparison procedure,multiple testing,observed confidence level,restricted parameter space","FALSE DISCOVERY RATE,CORRELATED Z-VALUES,STATISTICAL-INFERENCE,IMPRECISE PROBABILITIES,FIDUCIAL DISTRIBUTIONS,FINITE APPROXIMATIONS,DECISION-MAKING,NULL HYPOTHESIS,P-VALUES,INTERVALS","Bickel, David R.@Univ Ottawa, Dept Math & Stat, Dept Biochem Microbiol & Immunol, Ottawa Inst Syst Biol, Ottawa, ON K1H 8M5, Canada","Bickel, David R.@University of Ottawa","Bickel, David R.@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9623-3946","Mathematical foundations for a theory of confidence structures+Balch, Michael Scott+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPROXIMATE REASONING+OCT 2012::A comment on D.

A Unifying Framework for Marginalised Random-Intercept Models of Correlated Binary Outcomes,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12035,AUG 2014,54,1,"We demonstrate that many current approaches for marginal modelling of correlated binary outcomes produce likelihoods that are equivalent to the copula-based models herein. These general copula models of underlying latent threshold random variables yield likelihood-based models for marginal fixed effects estimation and interpretation in the analysis of correlated binary data with exchangeable correlation structures. Moreover, we propose a nomenclature and set of model relationships that substantially elucidates the complex area of marginalised random-intercept models for binary data.

He pursued undergraduate studies at the University of Alberta, where he completed a BEd in 1964 with a major in English and a minor in mathematics. He then specialized in statistics and psychometry, earning a PhD in psychology from Princeton University in 1966. After holding a temporary lectureship in the Department of Psychology at University College London for one year, he joined the Department of Psychology at McGill University, where he rose through the academic ranks. He was chair of his department from 1986 to 1989 and spent sabbatical leaves in Cambridge, Grenoble, and Toulouse. He was named professor emeritus upon his retirement in 2007. Jim is the author of four influential books and over 100 peer-reviewed articles in statistical and psychometric journals. He developed much of the statistical theory behind multidimensional scaling and is widely recognized as the founder of functional data analysis. Three of his papers were read to the Royal Statistical Society, and another won The Canadian Journal of Statistics 2000 Best Paper Award. The Statistical Society of Canada (SSC) awarded him a Gold Medal for research in 1998 and an honorary membership in 2012. Jim was president of the Psychometric Society in 1981-82 and president of the SSC in 2002-03. The following conversation took place at Jim's home in Ottawa, Ontario, on March 14 and April 4, 2012.","Foundations of measurement,functional data analysis,multidimensional scaling,psychometry","FUNCTIONAL DATA-ANALYSIS,PRINCIPAL DIFFERENTIAL ANALYSIS,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,MODEL-BASED PENALTIES,CURVE REGISTRATION,PARAMETER-ESTIMATION,HEIGHT ACCELERATION,COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS,SMOOTHING APPROACH,ITEM ANALYSIS","Genest, Christian@McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ, Canada::Neslehova, Johanna G.@McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ, Canada","Genest, Christian@McGill University::Neslehova, Johanna G.@McGill University",not exist,"DETECTING AND CORRECTING FOR RATER-INDUCED DIFFERENCES IN STANDARDIZED PATIENT TESTS OF CLINICAL COMPETENCE+ABRAHAMOWICZ, M; TAMBLYN, RM; RAMSAY, JO; et al.+ACADEMIC MEDICINE+SEP 1990::NONPARAMETRIC DENSITY-ESTIMATION FOR CENSORED SURVIVAL-DATA - REGRESSION-SPLINE APPROACH+ABRAHAMOWICZ, M; CIAMPI, A; RAMSAY, JO+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+JUN 1992::MULTICATEGORICAL SPLINE MODEL FOR ITEM RESPONSE THEORY+ABRAHAMOWICZ, M; RAMSAY, JO+PSYCHOMETRIKA+MAR 1992::no title+Andrews, D.

A Cognitive Interpretation of Data Analysis,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12028,AUG 2014,88,13,"This paper proposes a scientific model to explain the analysis process. We argue that data analysis is primarily a procedure to build understanding, and as such, it dovetails with the cognitive processes of the human mind. Data analysis tasks closely resemble the cognitive process known as sensemaking. We demonstrate how data analysis is a sensemaking task adapted to use quantitative data. This identification highlights a universal structure within data analysis activities and provides a foundation for a theory of data analysis. The competing tensions of cognitive compatibility and scientific rigour create a series of problems that characterise the data analysis process. These problems form a useful organising model for the data analysis task while allowing methods to remain flexible and situation dependent. The insights of this model are especially helpful for consultants, applied statisticians and teachers of data analysis.","Data analysis,cognition,cognitive process,data analysis model","SPACE-SHUTTLE,STATISTICS,SENSEMAKING,OZONE","Grolemund, Garrett@RStudio Inc, Boston, MA 02210 USA::Wickham, Hadley@Rice Univ, Dept Stat, Houston, TX 77005 USA","Grolemund, Garrett@Unknow::Wickham, Hadley@Rice University",not exist,"Improving the cost structure of sensemaking tasks: Analysing user concepts to inform information system design+Attfield, S.; Blandford, A.+Human-Computer Interaction-INTERACT+2009::no title+Bartlett, F.

Combining Statistical Evidence,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12037,AUG 2014,140,8,"The combination of evidence from independent studies has a curious history. The origins reach back at least to the beginning of the 20th century. Since the mid-1970s, meta-analysis has become popular in several fields, among them medical statistics and the behavioural sciences. The most widely used procedures were perfected in early papers, and subsequently, a kind of groupthink has taken hold of meta-analysis. This explains the need for a review in a statistics journal, destined for a statistical audience. Meta-analysis is not a hot research topic among graduate students in statistics, and by writing this article, we hope to change this. We wish to point out the shortcomings of the mainstream view and exhibit some of the open problems that await the attention of statistical researchers.

A host of competent reviews of meta-analysis have been published, and several book-length treatments are also available. We have listed many of these in the bibliography but cannot guarantee completeness.","Review,meta-analysis,effect size,random effects,meta-regression,software","RANDOM-EFFECTS METAANALYSIS,INDIVIDUAL PATIENT DATA,RANDOM-EFFECTS MODEL,TRIAL SEQUENTIAL-ANALYSIS,WEIGHTED MEANS STATISTICS,ISPOR TASK-FORCE,ONE-WAY ANOVA,CLINICAL-TRIALS,CUMULATIVE METAANALYSIS,PUBLICATION BIAS","Kulinskaya, Elena@Univ E Anglia, Sch Comp Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England::Morgenthaler, Stephan@Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland::Staudte, Robert G.@La Trobe Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia","Kulinskaya, Elena@University of East Anglia::Morgenthaler, Stephan@Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne::Staudte, Robert G.@La Trobe University","staudte, robert@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1281-7387","Approximate is better than ""exact"" for interval estimation of binomial proportions+Agresti, A; Coull, BA+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1998::Heteroscedastic one-way ANOVA and lack-of-fit tests+Akritas, MG; Papadatos, N+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2004::THE TRANSFORMATION OF POISSON, BINOMIAL AND NEGATIVE-BINOMIAL DATA+ANSCOMBE, FJ+BIOMETRIKA+1948::Bivariate random effects meta-analysis of ROC curves+Arends, L.

A Review and Comparison of Bandwidth Selection Methods for Kernel Regression,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12039,AUG 2014,37,10,"Over the last decades, several methods for selecting the bandwidth have been introduced in kernel regression. They differ quite a bit, and although there already exist more selection methods than for any other regression smoother, one can still observe coming up new ones. Given the need of automatic data-driven bandwidth selectors for applied statistics, this review is intended to explain and, above all, compare these methods. About 20 different selection methods have been revised, implemented and compared in an extensive simulation study.","Kernel regression,bandwidth selection,plug-in,cross-validation","GENERALIZED CROSS-VALIDATION,SMOOTHING PARAMETER SELECTION,NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION,DENSITY-ESTIMATION,VARIABLE BANDWIDTH,CURVE ESTIMATION,BOOTSTRAP,CHOICE,ERROR,CP","Koehler, Max@Univ Gottingen, Fac Econ Sci, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany::Schindler, Anja@Univ Gottingen, Fac Econ Sci, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany::Sperlich, Stefan@Univ Geneva, Dept Sci Econ, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland@Univ Geneva, Res Ctr Stat, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland","Koehler, Max@University of Gottingen::Schindler, Anja@University of Gottingen::Sperlich, Stefan@University of Geneva",not exist,"Fitting autoregressive models for prediction+Akaike, H.+Ann.

Numerical Maximisation of Likelihood: A Neglected Alternative to EM?,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12041,AUG 2014,51,22,"There is by now a long tradition of using the EM algorithm to find maximum-likelihood estimates (MLEs) when the data are incomplete in any of a wide range of ways, even when the observed-data likelihood can easily be evaluated and numerical maximisation of that likelihood is available as a conceptually simple route to the MLEs. It is rare in the literature to see numerical maximisation employed if EM is possible. But with excellent general-purpose numerical optimisers now available free, there is no longer any reason, as a matter of course, to avoid direct numerical maximisation of likelihood. In this tutorial, I present seven examples of models in which numerical maximisation of likelihood appears to have some advantages over the use of EM as a route to MLEs. The mathematical and coding effort is minimal, as there is no need to derive and code the E and M steps, only a likelihood evaluator. In all the examples, the unconstrained optimiser nlm available in R is used, and transformations are used to impose constraints on parameters.

I suggest therefore that the following question be asked of proposed new applications of EM: Can the MLEs be found more simply and directly by using a general-purpose numerical optimiser?","maximum likelihood,EM algorithm,numerical maximisation,constrained optimisation,Poisson mixtures,Markov chains,hidden Markov models","HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,ALGORITHM,DISTRIBUTIONS,CONVERGENCE,MIXTURES","MacDonald, Iain L.@Univ Cape Town, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa","MacDonald, Iain L.@University of Cape Town",not exist,"Mixed hidden Markov models: An extension of the hidden Markov model to the longitudinal data setting+Altman, Rachel MacKay+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2007::Application of hidden Markov models to multiple sclerosis lesion count data+Altman, RM; Petkau, AJ+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+AUG 15 2005::DOMAINS OF CONVERGENCE FOR THE EM ALGORITHM - A CAUTIONARY TALE IN A LOCATION ESTIMATION PROBLEM+ARSLAN, O; CONSTABLE, PDL; KENT, JT+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+SEP 1993::Statistical applications of the multivariate skew normal distribution+Azzalini, A; Capitanio, A+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1999::Smooth tests of fit for a mixture of two Poisson distributions+Best, D.J.; Rayner, J.C.W.; Thas, O.+P 4 ANN ASEARC C 17+2011::no title+Bishop, C.

"Soft Questions, Hard Answers: Jacob Bernoulli's Probability in Historical Context",INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12049,APR 2014,23,3,"On the 300th anniversary of the publication of Jacob Bernoulli's Ars Conjectandi, the book is revisited in historical context and seen in a new light. Bernoulli's announced goal of extending the application of probability from games to civil life was frustrated by the a priori difficulty of specifying equally likely cases. The great approximation theorem Bernoulli proved and suggested could lead to empirical applications was impractical for all but unrealistically large sample sizes, but it was immensely influential in the development of the mathematics of probability.","history of probability,dice,Law of Large Numbers,Huygens,Cardano","LARGE NUMBERS,LAW","Stigler, Stephen@Univ Chicago, Dept Stat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Stigler, Stephen@University of Chicago",not exist,"Decoding Cardano's Liber de Ludo Aleae+Bellhouse, D+HISTORIA MATHEMATICA+MAY 2005::no title+Bernoulli, J.+Ars Conjectandi+1713::no title+Bernoulli, Jacob.+The Art of Conjecturing+2006::Liber de ludo aleae+Cardano, G.+Hieronymi Cardani, Opera Omnia, Tomus Primus+1663::no title+Courcier.+Notice des Principaux Ouvrages de Fonds et autres en Grand Nombre+1819::no title+Daston, Lorraine.+Classical Probability in the Enlightenment+1988::Probability, Probabilities, Theory of+De Morgan, A.+The Penny Cyclopedia+1841::Cardan, Jerome+De Morgan, A.+The Penny Cyclopedia+1836::TERCENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARY OF BERNOULLI'S LAW OF LARGE NUMBERS+Denker, Manfred+BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY+JUL 2013::Mysteries of Cardano the Probabilist+Diaconis, P.+Stanford Statistics Technical Report No. 2003-3+2003::no title+Edwards, A.W.F.+Pascal's Arithmetical Triangle+2002::no title+Hacking, Ian.+The Emergence of Probability: A Philosophical Study of Early Ideas About Probability, Induction, and Statistical Inference+2006::no title+Hald, A.+A history of probability &amp; statistics and their applications before 1750+1990::no title+HUYGENS C+EXERCITATIONUM MATH+1657::no title+McCullagh, P.; Nelder, J.A.+Generalized Linear Models+1989::no title+Ore, O.+Cardano the Gambling Scholar+1953::A Tricentenary history of the Law of Large Numbers+Seneta, Eugene+BERNOULLI+SEP 2013::NON-ADDITIVE PROBABILITIES IN WORK OF BERNOULLI AND LAMBERT+SHAFER, G+ARCHIVE FOR HISTORY OF EXACT SCIENCES+1978::no title+SHEYNIN OB+ARCH HIST EXACT SCI+1971::Chance is 350 years old+Stigler, S.

Bernoulli gave a mathematically rigorous proof of what has come to be called the weak law of large numbers, relevant to discovering ratios of unknown factors through sampling. The Art of Conjecturing was a bridge between the mathematics of expectation in games of chance as found in Huygens's On Reckoning in Games of Chance and mathematical probability as found in Abraham De Moivre's The Doctrine of Chances. This paper looks at the conceptual context as well as the mathematics of Bernoulli's book.","probability without chance,Art of conjecturing,Huygens,Jacob Bernoulli, De Moivre, Bernoulli's fundamental theorem or weak law of large numbers",,"Sylla, Edith Dudley@N Carolina State Univ, Dept Hist, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Sylla, Edith Dudley@North Carolina State University@University of North Carolina",not exist,"edition critique par Pierre Clair et Francois Girbal+Antoine, Arnauld; Nicole, Pierre.+La Logique ou L'Art de penser+1981::no title+Arnauld, A.+The Art of Thinking (Port Royal Logic)+1662::no title+Bernoulli, J.+Ars Conjectandi, Opus Posthumum+1713::no title+Bernoulli, Ja.+Der Briefwechsel von Jacob Bernoulli+1993::Die Werke von Jakob Bernoulli+Bernoulli, Ja.+Herausgegeben von der Naturforschenden Gesellschaft in Basel+1975::no title+Bernoulli, Ja.+The Art of Conjecturing, trans. and intro+2006::no title+BERNOULLI, JAK.+Opera+1744::The Doctrine of Chances without Chance: Determinism, Mathematical Probability, and Quantification in the Seventeenth Century+Daston, L.+The Invention of Physical Science.

A Brief Survey of Modern Optimization for Statisticians,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12022,APR 2014,94,10,"Modern computational statistics is turning more and more to high-dimensional optimization to handle the deluge of big data. Once a model is formulated, its parameters can be estimated by optimization. Because model parsimony is important, models routinely include non-differentiable penalty terms such as the lasso. This sober reality complicates minimization and maximization. Our broad survey stresses a few important principles in algorithm design. Rather than view these principles in isolation, it is more productive to mix and match them. A few well-chosen examples illustrate this point. Algorithm derivation is also emphasized, and theory is downplayed, particularly the abstractions of the convex calculus. Thus, our survey should be useful and accessible to a broad audience.","acceleration,augmented Lagrangian,penalization,MM algorithm,Newton's method,Block relaxation","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,EM ALGORITHM,LEAST-SQUARES,MATRIX FACTORIZATION,EXPONENTIAL FAMILY,INCOMPLETE-DATA,MM ALGORITHMS,LASSO,ACCELERATION","Lange, Kenneth@Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Biomath, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA@Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Stat, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA@Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Human Genet, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA::Chi, Eric C.@Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Human Genet, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA::Zhou, Hua@N Carolina State Univ, Dept Stat, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Lange, Kenneth@University of California System@University of California Los Angeles::Chi, Eric C.@University of California System@University of California Los Angeles::Zhou, Hua@North Carolina State University@University of North Carolina","Chi, Eric@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4647-0895","no title+no author+P KDD CUP WORKSH+2007::A Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm for Linear Inverse Problems+Beck, Amir; Teboulle, Marc+SIAM JOURNAL ON IMAGING SCIENCES+2009::Acceleration schemes with application to the EM algorithm+Berlinet, A.; Roland, Ch.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+MAY 1 2007::Sparse estimation of a covariance matrix+Bien, Jacob; Tibshirani, Robert J.+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 2011::Block relaxation algorithms in statistics+De Leeuw, J.+Information Systems and Data Analysis+1994::MONOTONICITY OF QUADRATIC-APPROXIMATION ALGORITHMS+BOHNING, D; LINDSAY, BG+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+1988::no title+Borwein, J.

Multiple Local Maxima in Restricted Likelihoods and Posterior Distributions for Mixed Linear Models,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12046,APR 2014,28,1,"Scattered reports of multiple maxima in posterior distributions or likelihoods for mixed linear models appear throughout the literature. Less scrutinised is the restricted likelihood, which is the posterior distribution for a specific prior distribution. This paper surveys existing literature and proposes a unifying framework for understanding multiple maxima. For those problems with covariance structures that are diagonalisable in a specific sense, the restricted likelihood can be viewed as a generalised linear model with gamma errors, identity link and a prior distribution on the error variance. The generalised linear model portion of the restricted likelihood can be made to conflict with the portion of the restricted likelihood that functions like a prior distribution on the error variance, giving two local maxima in the restricted likelihood. Applying in addition an explicit conjugate prior distribution to variance parameters permits a second local maximum in the marginal posterior distribution even if the likelihood contribution has a single maximum. Moreover, reparameterisation from variance to precision can change the posterior modality; the converse also is true. Modellers should beware of these potential pitfalls when selecting prior distributions or using peak-finding algorithms to estimate parameters.","Variance component,diagonalisable covariance,precision reparameterisation,generalised linear model,random effects","VARIANCE-COMPONENTS,BIMODALITY,LOCATION","Henn, Lisa@Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Biostatist, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA::Hodges, James S.@Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Biostatist, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Henn, Lisa@Unknow::Hodges, James S.@Unknow",not exist,"BAYESIAN IMAGE-RESTORATION, WITH 2 APPLICATIONS IN SPATIAL STATISTICS+BESAG, J; YORK, J; MOLLIE, A+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+MAR 1991::On the existence of the maximum likelihood estimate in variance components model+Demidenko, E.; Massam, H.+Sankhya, Indian J.

Non-parametric Analysis of Gap Times for Multiple Event Data: An Overview,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12031,APR 2014,24,3,"Multiple event data are frequently encountered in medical follow-up, engineering and other applications when the multiple events are considered as the major outcomes. They may be repetitions of the same event (recurrent events) or may be events of different nature. Times between successive events (gap times) are often of direct interest in these applications. The stochastic-ordering structure and within-subject dependence of multiple events generate statistical challenges for analysing such data, including induced dependent censoring and non-identifiability of marginal distributions. This paper provides an overview of a class of existing non-parametric estimation methods for gap time distributions for various types of multiple event data, where sampling bias from induced dependent censoring is effectively adjusted. We discuss the statistical issues in gap time analysis, describe the estimation procedures and illustrate the methods with a comparative simulation study and a real application to an AIDS clinical trial. A comprehensive understanding of challenges and available methods for non-parametric analysis can be useful because there is no existing standard approach to identifying an appropriate gap time method that can be used to address research question of interest. The methods discussed in this review would allow practitioners to effectively handle a variety of real-world multiple event data.","recurrent events,multivariate failure times,non-identifiability,Induced dependent censoring,joint and conditional distributions","SURVIVAL FUNCTION,RECURRENT EVENTS,SEMIPARAMETRIC REGRESSION,MARGINAL REGRESSION,SERIAL EVENTS,CENSORED-DATA,DISTRIBUTIONS,MODEL","Zhu, Hong@Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Div Biostat, Dept Clin Sci, Dallas, TX 75390 USA","Zhu, Hong@University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Dallas@University of Texas System",not exist,"A COMPARATIVE TRIAL OF DIDANOSINE OR ZALCITABINE AFTER TREATMENT WITH ZIDOVUDINE IN PATIENTS WITH HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS INFECTION+ABRAMS, DI; GOLDMAN, AI; LAUNER, C; et al.+NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE+MAR 10 1994::COX REGRESSION-MODEL FOR COUNTING-PROCESSES - A LARGE SAMPLE STUDY+ANDERSEN, PK; GILL, RD+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1982::Semiparametric regression analysis on longitudinal pattern of recurrent gap times+Chen, YQ; Wang, MC; Huang, YJ+BIOSTATISTICS+APR 2004::MODEL FOR ASSOCIATION IN BIVARIATE LIFE TABLES AND ITS APPLICATION IN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL-STUDIES OF FAMILIAL TENDENCY IN CHRONIC DISEASE INCIDENCE+CLAYTON, DG+BIOMETRIKA+1978::A QUALITY-OF-LIFE-ORIENTED ENDPOINT FOR COMPARING THERAPIES+GELBER, RD; GELMAN, RS; GOLDHIRSCH, A+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1989::Nonparametric estimation of the bivariate recurrence time distribution+Huang, CY; Wang, MC+BIOMETRICS+JUN 2005::Nonparametric estimation of the joint distribution of survival time and mark variables+Huang, YJ; Louis, TA+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1998::Marginal regression of gaps between recurrent events+Huang, YJ; Chen, YQ+LIFETIME DATA ANALYSIS+SEP 2003::NONPARAMETRIC-ESTIMATION FROM INCOMPLETE OBSERVATIONS+KAPLAN, EL; MEIER, P+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1958::SOME SIMPLE ROBUST METHODS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF RECURRENT EVENTS+LAWLESS, JF; NADEAU, C+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 1995::Nonparametric tests for the gap time distributions of serial events based on censored data+Lin, DY; Ying, ZL+BIOMETRICS+JUN 2001::Nonparametric estimation of the gap time distributions for serial events with censored data+Lin, DY; Sun, W; Ying, ZL+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1999::Semiparametric regression for the mean and rate functions of recurrent events+Lin, DY; Wei, LJ; Yang, I; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2000::Nonparametric estimation with recurrent event data+Pena, EA; Strawderman, RL; Hollander, M+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2001::SOME GRAPHICAL DISPLAYS AND MARGINAL REGRESSION-ANALYSES FOR RECURRENT FAILURE TIMES AND TIME-DEPENDENT COVARIATES+PEPE, MS; CAI, JW+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1993::ON THE REGRESSION-ANALYSIS OF MULTIVARIATE FAILURE TIME DATA+PRENTICE, RL; WILLIAMS, BJ; PETERSON, AV+BIOMETRIKA+1981::Regression methods for gap time hazard functions of sequentially ordered multivariate failure time data+Schaubel, DE; Cai, JW+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 2004::Non-parametric estimation of gap time survival functions for ordered multivariate failure time data+Schaubel, DE; Cai, JW+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUN 30 2004::Locally efficient estimation of a multivariate survival function in longitudinal studies+van der Laan, MJ; Hubbard, AE; Robins, JM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2002::Nonparametric estimation of the bivariate survival function with an application to vertically transmitted AIDS+Visser, M+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1996::Analyzing recurrent event data with informative censoring+Wang, MC; Qin, J; Chiang, CT+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2001::Nonparametric estimation of a recurrent survival function+Wang, MC; Chang, SH+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1999::Nonparametric estimation of successive duration times under dependent censoring+Wang, WJ; Wells, MT+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1998::Bivariate frailty model for the analysis of multivariate survival time+Xue, X.; Brookmeyer, R.+Lifetime Data Anal.+1996"
Asymptotics for Autocovariances and Integrated Periodograms for Linear Processes Observed at Lower Frequencies,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12019,APR 2014,15,4,"One of the most frequently used class of processes in time series analysis is the one of linear processes. For many statistical quantities, among them sample autocovariances and sample autocorrelations, central limit theorems are available in the literature. We investigate classical linear processes under a nonstandard observation pattern; namely, we assume that we are only able to observe the linear process at a lower frequency. It is shown that such observation pattern destroys the linear structure of the observations and leads to substantially different asymptotic results for standard statistical quantities. Central limit theorems are given for sample autocovariances and sample autocorrelations as well as more general integrated periodograms and ratio statistics. Moreover, for specific autoregressive processes, the possibilities to estimate the parameters of the underlying autoregression from lower frequency observations are addressed. Finally, we suggest for autoregressions of order 2 a valid bootstrap procedure.

A Conversation with Colin L. Mallows,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12038,DEC 2013,38,0,"Colin L. Mallows has had a distinguished career as a research statistician in the telecommunications industry, primarily at Bell Labs, that has spanned more than 50years.Best known for creating C-p', the regression model diagnostic procedure that has been widely used and probably benefitted all statisticians who have done regressions, Mallows also has, and continues, to produce influential research on a wide variety of statistical and mathematical topics. He has received the Wilks Memorial Award, the American Statistical Associations' highest award and presented both the Fisher Lecture and the Deming Lecture at the Joint Statistical Meetings. Mallows is one of only two statisticians (the other being George Box) to have received all three of these honours that are among the highest the profession bestows.Born in England in 1930, Mallows received his PhD at the age of 22 from University College London under F.N. David and N.L. Johnson. In 1956, John Tukey invited him to spend a year at Princeton, and in 1960, Mallows joined Bell Labs, the R&D unit of AT&T, which at the time was the regulated monopoly telecommunications provider in the USA (Ma Bell). Mallows served as Department Head of one of the two Bell Labs Statistics Research Departments for many years and remained at Bell Labs until 1995, when he joined the AT&T Labs unit that was created as part of the restructuring of the telecommunications industry. Since his retirement from AT&T Labs in 2000, Mallows continues to consult part-time in Avaya Labs, which is a sister company in telecommunications that also traces its roots back to AT&T and Bell Labs.This conversation was held in November, 2011, with two long-time colleagues and collaborators from both Bell Labs and now Avaya Labs.

A Survey of L-1 Regression,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12023,DEC 2013,111,18,"L-1 regularization, or regularization with an L-1 penalty, is a popular idea in statistics and machine learning. This paper reviews the concept and application of L-1 regularization for regression. It is not our aim to present a comprehensive list of the utilities of the L-1 penalty in the regression setting. Rather, we focus on what we believe is the set of most representative uses of this regularization technique, which we describe in some detail. Thus, we deal with a number of L-1-regularized methods for linear regression, generalized linear models, and time series analysis. Although this review targets practice rather than theory, we do give some theoretical details about L-1-penalized linear regression, usually referred to as the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso).","Regularization,lasso,L-1-regularized regression,sparsity","SPARSE LOGISTIC-REGRESSION,GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,LEAST ANGLE REGRESSION,VARIABLE SELECTION,COORDINATE DESCENT,DANTZIG SELECTOR,ADAPTIVE LASSO,NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION,BAYESIAN REGULARIZATION,PENALIZED REGRESSION","Vidaurre, Diego@Univ Oxford, Dept Psychiat, Oxford Ctr Human Brain Act, Oxford OX1 2JD, England::Bielza, Concha@Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Inteligencia Artificial, Computat Intelligence Grp, E-28040 Madrid, Spain::Larranaga, Pedro@Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Inteligencia Artificial, Computat Intelligence Grp, E-28040 Madrid, Spain","Vidaurre, Diego@University of Oxford::Bielza, Concha@Polytechnic University of Madrid::Larranaga, Pedro@Polytechnic University of Madrid","Larranaga, Pedro@F-9293-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0652-9872::Bielza, Concha@F-9277-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7109-2668","SCALE MIXTURES OF NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS+ANDREWS, DF; MALLOWS, CL+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1974::Regularization of wavelet approximations+Antoniadis, A; Fan, JQ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2001::Bolasso: Model Consistent Lasso Estimation Through the Bootstrap+Bach, F.

Proportional Odds Models with High-Dimensional Data Structure,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12032,DEC 2013,47,2,"The proportional odds model is the most widely used model when the response has ordered categories. In the case of high-dimensional predictor structure, the common maximum likelihood approach typically fails when all predictors are included. A boosting technique pomBoost is proposed to fit the model by implicitly selecting the influential predictors. The approach distinguishes between metric and categorical predictors. In the case of categorical predictors, where each predictor relates to a set of parameters, the objective is to select simultaneously all the associated parameters. In addition, the approach distinguishes between nominal and ordinal predictors. In the case of ordinal predictors, the proposed technique uses the ordering of the ordinal predictors by penalizing the difference between the parameters of adjacent categories. The technique has also a provision to consider some mandatory predictors (if any) that must be part of the final sparse model. The performance of the proposed boosting algorithm is evaluated in a simulation study and applications with respect to mean squared error and prediction error.

"The Modern Census: Evolution, Examples and Evaluation",INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12036,DEC 2013,61,10,"A national census provides important information on a country's population that is used in government planning and to underpin the national statistical system. Therefore, the quality of such information is paramount but is not as simple as the crude accuracy of population totals. Furthermore, changes in the pace and nature of modern life, such as the growing geographical mobility of the population, increasingly pose challenges to census practice and data quality. More recently, even the need for a census has been questioned on grounds of financial austerity and widespread availability of alternative population information sources. This article reviews how the modern census originated and how it evolved to confront these challenges, driven by indicators of quality and needs of users, and provides reflections on the future of the census within the national statistical infrastructure. To illustrate our discussions, we use case studies from a diverse range of national contexts. We demonstrate the implications that a country's needs, circumstances and experiences have on the census approach and practice while identifying the fundamental demographic assumptions.","Census,evaluation,international comparison,census quality","STATISTICS,HOUSEHOLD,HISTORY","Baffour, Bernard@Univ Queensland, Inst Social Sci Res, Brisbane, Qld, Australia::King, Thomas@Univ Newcastle, Sch Educ Commun & Language Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England::Valente, Paolo@UNECE, Stat Div, Geneva, Switzerland","Baffour, Bernard@University of Queensland::King, Thomas@Newcastle University - UK::Valente, Paolo@Unknow","Baffour, Bernard@O-7950-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9820-2617::King, Thomas@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4740-1595","2011 UK Census Coverage Assessment and Adjustment Strategy+Abbott, O.+Population Trends+2009::no title+Anderson, M.+The American Census: A Social History+1988::An evaluation of census quality+Baffour, B; Valente, P.+Stat J IAOS+2012::The rise of survey sampling+Bethlehem, J.+Discussion Paper 0915+2009::The 2010 Brazilian population census: innovations and impacts in data collection+Bianchini, Z.+58 WORLD C INT STAT+2011::no title+Bingham, T.+The Rule of Law+2010::Managing data quality in a statistical agency+Brackston, G.+Statistics Canada Survey Methodology.+1999::Supporting a population and housing census in a post conflict fragile countryDemocratic Republic of Congo+Bradford-Smith, K.+17 GSS METH C 27 JUN+2012::THE 1991 CENSUS ADJUSTMENT - UNDERCOUNT OR BAD DATA+BREIMAN, L+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+NOV 1994::A methodological strategy for a one-number census in the UK+Brown, JJ; Diamond, ID; Chambers, RL; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1999::Census quality+Cezard, M.; Lefebvre, O.+Institut National de la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques (National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies) report+2008::no title+Champkin, J.+Happy birthday, 7 billionth baby.

A Summary of Attack Methods and Confidentiality Protection Measures for Fully Automated Remote Analysis Systems,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12021,DEC 2013,60,9,"This paper presents a summary of the current state of research on reducing the risk of disclosure related to what may be called non-traditional outputs for statistical agencies. Whereas traditional outputs include frequency tables, magnitude tables and public use microdata files, non-traditional outputs include outputs associated with user-defined exploratory data analysis and statistical modelling offered through a remote analysis system. In remote analysis, a system accepts a query from an analyst, runs it on data held in a secure environment, and then returns the results to the analyst. There is a considerable current interest in fully automated remote analysis systems, because these have the potential to enable agencies to respond to growing researcher demand for more and more detailed data. In practice, a range of protective measures is most effective in remote analysis, and the choice of this range depends heavily on the context including the regulatory environment, the dataset itself, and the purpose of the access.This paper provides a summary of known attack methods on remote analysis system outputs, focussing on exploratory data analysis and linear regression. The paper also summarizes the associated suggested protective measures designed to prevent disclosures and thwart attacks in fully automated remote analysis systems. Some commentary on the attacks and measures is provided.","Confidentiality,privacy,remote analysis,statistical disclosure control,analysis output checking","STATISTICAL DISCLOSURE CONTROL,EXPLORATORY DATA-ANALYSIS,TABULAR DATA,ACCESS,MICRODATA,RISK,SERVERS,REGRESSION,CENSUS,DIAGNOSTICS","O'Keefe, Christine M.@CSIRO Math Informat & Stat, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia::Chipperfield, James O.@Australian Bur Stat, Belconnen, ACT 2616, Australia","O'Keefe, Christine M.@Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)::Chipperfield, James O.@Unknow","O'Keefe, Christine@A-5945-2009@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8193-7820","Privacy, accuracy, and consistency too: A holistic solution to contingency table release+BARAK, B.; CHAUDHURI, K.; DWORK, C.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; KALE, S.; MCSHERRY, F.; TALWAR, K</span>.+P 26 ACM SIGMOD SIGA+2007::Remote Data Access and the Risk of Disclosure from Linear Regression: An Empirical Study+Bleninger, Philipp; Drechsler, Joerg; Ronning, Gerd+PRIVACY IN STATISTICAL DATABASES+2010::Guidelines for the checking of outputs based on microdata research.

Fingerprint-Based Recognition,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12017,AUG 2013,21,2,"Biometric recognition, or biometrics, refers to the authentication of an individual on the basis of her or his biometric traits. Among the various biometric traits (e.g., face, iris, fingerprint, and voice), fingerprint-based authentication has the longest history and has been successfully adopted in both forensic and civilian applications. Advances in fingerprint capture technology have resulted in new large-scale civilian applications (e.g., US Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology program). However, these systems still encounter difficulties due to various noise factors present in operating environments. There is also a general lack of scientific development in forensic methods, including fingerprint-based methods, in terms of identifying, incorporating, and quantifying sources of variability in the decision-making process. The purpose of this article is to give an overview of current practice in fingerprint-based recognition, its challenges, and areas of future research.","Biometric authentication,biometric variability,fingerprint recognition,identification,verification","INDIVIDUALITY,MODELS","Dass, Sarat C.@Univ Teknol Petronas, Perak, Malaysia@Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Dass, Sarat C.@Michigan State University@Universiti Teknologi Petronas",not exist,"no title+no author+Strengthening forensic science in the United States: a path forward+2009::HIERARCHICAL MIXTURE MODELS FOR ASSESSING FINGERPRINT INDIVIDUALITY+Dass, Sarat C.; Li, Mingfei+ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS+DEC 2009::Assessing Fingerprint Individuality in Presence of Noisy Minutiae+Dass, Sarat C.+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY+MAR 2010::Fingerprint-based recognition+Dass, Sarat C.; Jain, Anil K.+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 2007::Scientific Principles of Friction Ridge Analysis: Applying Daubert to Latent Fingerprint Identification+Ferriola, T.J.+Reprinted from Criminal Law Bulletin (with permission)+2002::no title+Henry, E.

Minimax-Optimal Strength of Statistical Evidence for a Composite Alternative Hypothesis,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12008,AUG 2013,75,3,"While the likelihood ratio measures statistical support for an alternative hypothesis about a single parameter value, it is undefined for an alternative hypothesis that is composite in the sense that it corresponds to multiple parameter values. Regarding the parameter of interest as a random variable enables measuring support for a composite alternative hypothesis without requiring the elicitation or estimation of a prior distribution, as described below. In this setting, in which parameter randomness represents variability rather than uncertainty, the ideal measure of the support for one hypothesis over another is the difference in the posterior and prior log-odds. That ideal support may be replaced by any measure of support that, on a per-observation basis, is asymptotically unbiased as a predictor of the ideal support. Such measures of support are easily interpreted and, if desired, can be combined with any specified or estimated prior probability of the null hypothesis. Two qualifying measures of support are minimax-optimal. An application to proteomics data indicates that a modification of optimal support computed from data for a single protein can closely approximate the estimated difference in posterior and prior odds that would be available with the data for 20 proteins.","Direct likelihood,empirical Bayes,indirect evidence,information for discrimination,minimum description length,likelihood paradigm,likelihoodism,multiple comparisons,multiple testing,normalized maximum likelihood,objective Bayes factor,objective Bayesian model selection,pure likelihood,random-effects model,strength of statistical evidence,weighted likelihood","DISCOVERY RATE ESTIMATION,BAYES FACTORS,GENE-EXPRESSION,WEIGHTED LIKELIHOOD,DISTRIBUTIONS,PROBABILITY,ASSOCIATION,PREDICTION,INFERENCE,REGRET","Bickel, David R.@Univ Ottawa, Dept Biochem Microbiol & Immunol, Ottawa Inst Syst Biol, Ottawa, ON K1H 8M5, Canada@Univ Ottawa, Dept Math & Stat, Ottawa, ON K1H 8M5, Canada","Bickel, David R.@University of Ottawa","Bickel, David R.@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9623-3946","POSTERIOR BAYES FACTORS+AITKIN, M+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1991::Statistical Inference: An Integrated Bayesian/Likelihood Approach+Aitkin, M.+MONOGRAPHS STAT APPL+2010::A mixture model approach for the analysis of microarray gene expression data+Allison, DB; Gadbury, GL; Heo, MS; et al.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+MAR 28 2002::The intrinsic Bayes factor for model selection and prediction+Berger, JO; Pericchi, LR+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1996::Pseudo likelihood, explanatory power, and Bayes's theorem (comment on A likelihood paradigm for clinical trials by Z.

Objective Bayes Factors for Inequality Constrained Hypotheses,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12010,AUG 2013,37,4,This paper will present a Bayes factor for the comparison of an inequality constrained hypothesis with its complement or an unconstrained hypothesis. Equivalent sets of hypotheses form the basis for the quantification of the complexity of an inequality constrained hypothesis. It will be shown that the prior distribution can be chosen such that one of the terms in the Bayes factor is the quantification of the complexity of the hypothesis of interest. The other term in the Bayes factor represents a measure of the fit of the hypothesis. Using a vague prior distribution this fit value is essentially determined by the data. The result is an objective Bayes factor.,"Bayes factor,equivalent hypotheses,inequality constraints,model complexity","LATENT CLASS ANALYSIS,CONTINGENCY-TABLES,P-VALUES,MODELS,DISTRIBUTIONS","Hoijtink, Herbert@Univ Utrecht, Dept Methods & Stat, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands@CITO Inst Educ Measurement, NL-6801 MG Arnhem, Netherlands","Hoijtink, Herbert@Utrecht University",not exist,"no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical Data Analysis+2002::Default Bayes factors for nonnested hypothesis testing+Berger, JO; Mortera, J+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1999::FITTING A RESPONSE MODEL FOR N DICHOTOMOUSLY SCORED ITEMS+BOCK, RD; LIEBERMAN, M+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1970::RECONCILING BAYESIAN AND FREQUENTIST EVIDENCE IN THE ONE-SIDED TESTING PROBLEM+CASELLA, G; BERGER, RL+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1987::Marginal likelihood from the Gibbs output+Chib, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1995::THE EARTH IS ROUND (P-LESS-THAN.05)+COHEN, J+AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST+DEC 1994::Markov chain Monte Carlo convergence diagnostics: A comparative review+Cowles, MK; Carlin, BP+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1996::LATENT CLASS ANALYSIS WITH ORDERED LATENT CLASSES+CROON, M+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+NOV 1990::no title+no author+Explanatory item response models: A generalized linear and nonlinear approach+2004::SAMPLING-BASED APPROACHES TO CALCULATING MARGINAL DENSITIES+GELFAND, AE; SMITH, AFM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1990::no title+Gelman, A.; Carlin, J.

Modelling Strategies for Repeated Multiple Response Data,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12015,AUG 2013,62,2,"This article discusses modelling strategies for repeated measurements of multiple response variables. Such data arise in the context of categorical variables where one can select more than one of the categories as the response. We consider each of the multiple responses as a binary outcome and use a marginal (or population-averaged) modelling approach to analyse its means. Generalized estimating equations are used to account for different correlation structures, both over time and between items. We also discuss an alternative approach using a generalized linear mixed model with conditional interpretations. We illustrate the methods using data from a panel study in Australia called the Household, Income, and Labour Dynamics Survey.","Repeated measurements,generalized linear models,generalized estimating equations,generalized linear mixed models","GENERALIZED ESTIMATING EQUATIONS,LINEAR MIXED MODELS,LONGITUDINAL BINARY RESPONSES,WORKING-CORRELATION-STRUCTURE,GOODNESS-OF-FIT,MARGINAL INDEPENDENCE,CATEGORY CHOICES,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,MULTILEVEL MODELS,MISSING DATA","Suesse, Thomas@Univ Wollongong, Sch Math & Appl Stat, Ctr Stat & Survey Methodol, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia::Liu, Ivy@Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Math Stat & Operat Res, Wellington, New Zealand","Suesse, Thomas@University of Wollongong::Liu, Ivy@Victoria University Wellington","Liu, Ivy@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3152-2632","Modeling a categorical variable allowing arbitrarily many category choices+Agresti, A; Liu, IM+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1999::no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical Data Analysis+2002::Strategies for modeling a categorical variable allowing multiple category choices+Agresti, A; Liu, I+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS &amp; RESEARCH+MAY 2001::Analysis of longitudinal binary data with missing data due to dropouts+Ali, MW; Talukder, E+JOURNAL OF BIOPHARMACEUTICAL STATISTICS+2005::Goodness-of-fit tests for GEE modeling with binary responses+Barnhart, HX; Williamson, JM+BIOMETRICS+JUN 1998::R-package lme4: Linear mixed-effects models using S4 classes+Bates, D; Maechler, M.+R PACKAGE LME4 LINEA+2010::Modeling association between two or more categorical variables that allow for multiple category choices+Bilder, Christopher R.; Loughin, Thomas M.+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2007::Testing for marginal independence between two categorical variables with multiple responses+Bilder, CR; Loughin, TM+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2004::Testing for conditional multiple marginal independence+Bilder, CR; Loughin, TM+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2002::Multiple marginal independence testing for pick any/C variables+Bilder, CR; Loughin, TM; Nettleton, D+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+2000::Maximizing generalized linear mixed model likelihoods with an automated Monte Carlo EM algorithm+Booth, JG; Hobert, JP+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1999::BIAS CORRECTION IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS WITH A SINGLE-COMPONENT OF DISPERSION+BRESLOW, NE; LIN, XH+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1995::APPROXIMATE INFERENCE IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS+BRESLOW, NE; CLAYTON, DG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::no title+By, K.; Qaqish, B.

Advances in Joint Modelling: A Review of Recent Developments with Application to the Survival of End Stage Renal Disease Patients,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12018,AUG 2013,58,10,"The use of joint modelling approaches is becoming increasingly popular when an association exists between survival and longitudinal processes. Widely recognized for their gain in efficiency, joint models also offer a reduction in bias compared with naive methods. With the increasing popularity comes a constantly expanding literature on joint modelling approaches. The aim of this paper is to give an overview of recent literature relating to joint models, in particular those that focus on the time-to-event survival process. A discussion is provided on the range of survival submodels that have been implemented in a joint modelling framework. A particular focus is given to the recent advancements in software used to build these models. Illustrated through the use of two different real-life data examples that focus on the survival of end-stage renal disease patients, the use of the JM and joineR packages within R are demonstrated. The possible future direction for this field of research is also discussed.","Joint model,renal survival data,longitudinal,software advancements","TIME-TO-EVENT,PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODEL,CHRONIC KIDNEY-DISEASE,LONGITUDINAL DATA,FAILURE TIME,MEASUREMENT ERRORS,REGRESSION-MODELS,INCOMPLETE DATA,RISKS,LIKELIHOOD","McCrink, Lisa M.@Queens Univ Belfast, Ctr Stat Sci & Operat Res CenSSOR, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland::Marshall, Adele H.@Queens Univ Belfast, Ctr Stat Sci & Operat Res CenSSOR, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland::Cairns, Karen J.@Queens Univ Belfast, Ctr Stat Sci & Operat Res CenSSOR, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland","McCrink, Lisa M.@Queens University Belfast::Marshall, Adele H.@Queens University Belfast::Cairns, Karen J.@Queens University Belfast","McFetridge, Lisa@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1372-1360","A flexible B-spline model for multiple longitudinal biomarkers and survival+Brown, ER; Ibrahim, JG; DeGruttola, V+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2005::A Bayesian semiparametric joint hierarchical model for longitudinal and survival data+Brown, ER; Ibrahim, JG+BIOMETRICS+JUN 2003::REGRESSION MODELS AND LIFE-TABLES+COX, DR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1972::STJM: stata module to fit shared parameter joint models of longitudinal and survival data+Crowther, M.+Technical Report+2011::A Bayesian framework for functional mapping through joint modeling of longitudinal and time-to-event data+Das, K; Li, R; Huang, Z<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Gai, J; Wu, R</span>.+Int.

On the Use of Auxiliary and Paradata for Dealing With Non-sampling Errors in Household Surveys,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12009,AUG 2013,50,2,"In this paper, we consider the use of auxiliary and paradata for dealing with non-response and measurement errors in household surveys. Three over-arching purposes are distinguished: response enhancement, statistical adjustment, and bias exploration. Attention is given to the varying focus at the different phases of statistical production from collection, processing to analysis, and how to select and utilize the useful auxiliary and paradata. Administrative register data provide the richest source of relevant auxiliary information, in addition to data collected in previous surveys and censuses. Due to their importance in effective dealings with non-sampling errors, one should make every effort to increase their availability in the statistical system and, at the same time, to develop efficient statistical methods that capitalize on the combined data sources.","Non-response,measurement error,household survey,auxiliary variable,paradata,response enhancement,statistical adjustment,bias exploration","SURVEY NONRESPONSE,IMPROVING REPRESENTATIVENESS,NONIGNORABLE NONRESPONSE,SURVEY RESPONSE,MISSING DATA,INDICATORS,EMPLOYMENT,DESIGN","Zhang, Li-Chun@Stat Norway, N-0033 Oslo, Norway::Thomsen, Ib@Stat Norway, N-0033 Oslo, Norway::Kleven, Oyvin@Stat Norway, N-0033 Oslo, Norway","Zhang, Li-Chun@Statistics Norway::Thomsen, Ib@Statistics Norway::Kleven, Oyvin@Statistics Norway",not exist,"Modeling and estimation methods for household size in the presence of nonignorable nonresponse applied to the Norwegian Consumer Expenditure Survey+Belsby, L; BjOrnstad, J.

Improving Electricity Market Price Forecasting with Factor Models for the Optimal Generation Bid,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/insr.12014,AUG 2013,66,2,"In liberalized electricity markets, the electricity generation companies usually manage their production by developing hourly bids that are sent to the day-ahead market. As the prices at which the energy will be purchased are unknown until the end of the bidding process, forecasting of spot prices has become an essential element in electricity management strategies. In this article, we apply forecasting factor models to the market framework in Spain and Portugal and study their performance. Although their goodness of fit is similar to that of autoregressive integrated moving average models, they are easier to implement. The second part of the paper uses the spot-price forecasting model to generate inputs for a stochastic programming model, which is then used to determine the company's optimal generation bid. The resulting optimal bidding curves are presented and analyzed in the context of the Iberian day-ahead electricity market.","Electricity market prices,short-term forecasting,stochastic programming,factor models,price scenarios","DYNAMIC FACTOR MODELS,MULTIVARIATE TIME-SERIES,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,NUMBER,ENERGY","Pilar Munoz, M.@Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Stat & Operat Res, ES-08034 Barcelona, Spain::Corchero, Cristina@Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Stat & Operat Res, ES-08034 Barcelona, Spain@Catalonia Inst Energy Res, St Adria Del Besos 08930, Spain::Heredia, F-Javier@Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Stat & Operat Res, ES-08034 Barcelona, Spain","Pilar Munoz, M.@Polytechnic University of Catalonia::Corchero, Cristina@Polytechnic University of Catalonia@Institut de Recerca en Energia de Catalunya (IREC)::Heredia, F-Javier@Polytechnic University of Catalonia","Corchero, Cristina@G-5229-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8465-0830","Seasonal dynamic factor analysis and bootstrap inference: application to electricity market forecasting+Alonso, A.

Interpreting DNA evidence: A review,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,DEC 2003,115,23,"The paper provides a review of current issues relating to the use of DNA profiling in forensic science. A short historical section gives the main statistical milestones that occurred during a rapid development of DNA technology and operational uses. Greater detail is then provided for interpretation issues involving STR DNA profiles, including:

methods that take account of population substructure in DNA calculations;

parallel work carried out by the US National Research Council;

the move away from multiple independence testing in favour of experiments that demonstrate the robustness of casework procedures;

the questionable practice of source attribution 'with reasonable scientific certainty';

the effect on the interpretation of profiles obtained under increasingly sensitive techniques, the LCN technique in particular;

the use of DNA profiles as an intelligence tool;

the interpretation of DNA mixtures.

Experience of presenting DNA evidence within UK courts is also discussed. The paper then summarises a generic interpretation framework based on the concept of likelihood ratio within a hierarchy of propositions. Finally the use of Bayesian networks to interpret DNA evidence is reviewed.","forensic science,interpretation of evidence,likelihood ratio,DNA profile,DNA mixtures,Bayesian networks","INFERRING ETHNIC-ORIGIN,SINGLE LOCUS PROFILES,POPULATION-GENETICS,FORENSIC-SCIENCE,STATISTICAL EVALUATION,SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE,BAYESIAN NETWORKS,DATABASE SEARCH,NRCS REPORT,PEAK AREAS","Foreman, LA@Forens Sci Serv Inc, London SE1 7LP, England@Forens Sci Serv Inc, Solihull, W Midlands, England::Champod, C@Forens Sci Serv Inc, London SE1 7LP, England@Forens Sci Serv Inc, Solihull, W Midlands, England::Evett, IW@Forens Sci Serv Inc, London SE1 7LP, England@Forens Sci Serv Inc, Solihull, W Midlands, England::Lambert, JA@Forens Sci Serv Inc, London SE1 7LP, England@Forens Sci Serv Inc, Solihull, W Midlands, England::Pope, S@Forens Sci Serv Inc, London SE1 7LP, England@Forens Sci Serv Inc, Solihull, W Midlands, England","Foreman, LA@Unknow@Unknow::Champod, C@Unknow@Unknow::Evett, IW@Unknow@Unknow::Lambert, JA@Unknow@Unknow::Pope, S@Unknow@Unknow","POPE, SUSAN@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0042-2839","no title+AITKEN CGG+IN PRESS THEORETICAL+2002::PROBABILISTIC REASONING IN EVIDENTIAL ASSESSMENT+AITKEN, CGG; GAMMERMAN, AJ+JOURNAL OF THE FORENSIC SCIENCE SOCIETY+SEP-OCT 1989::Statistical modelling in specific case analysis+Aitken, CGG; Connolly, T; Gammerman, A; et al.+SCIENCE &amp; JUSTICE+OCT-DEC 1996::Error and misunderstandings in the second NRC report+Balding, D.J.+Jurimetrics+1997::DNA PROFILE MATCH PROBABILITY CALCULATION - HOW TO ALLOW FOR POPULATION STRATIFICATION, RELATEDNESS, DATABASE SELECTION AND SINGLE BANDS+BALDING, DJ; NICHOLS, RA+FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL+FEB 1994::Population genetics of STR loci in Caucasians+Balding, DJ; Greenhalgh, M; Nichols, RA+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LEGAL MEDICINE+JUN 1996::Evaluating DNA profile evidence when the suspect is identified through a database search+Balding, DJ; Donnelly, P+JOURNAL OF FORENSIC SCIENCES+JUL 1996::ESTIMATING PRODUCTS IN FORENSIC IDENTIFICATION USING DNA PROFILES+BALDING, DJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1995::INFERENCE IN FORENSIC IDENTIFICATION+BALDING, DJ; DONNELLY, P+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1995::INFERRING IDENTITY FROM DNA PROFILE EVIDENCE+BALDING, DJ; DONNELLY, P+PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA+DEC 5 1995::When can a DNA profile be regarded as unique?+Balding, DJ+SCIENCE &amp; JUSTICE+OCT-DEC 1999::Interpreting DNA evidence: Can probability theory help?+Balding, DJ+STATISTICAL SCIENCE IN THE COURTROOM+2000::Statistical inference in crime investigations using deoxyribonucleic acid profiling (with discussion)+Berry, DA; Evett, IW; Pinchin, R.+Applied Statistics+1992::The fallacy of independence testing and the use of the product rule+Buckleton, JS; Walsh, S; Harbison, SA+SCIENCE &amp; JUSTICE+APR-JUN 2001::FIXED-BIN ANALYSIS FOR STATISTICAL EVALUATION OF CONTINUOUS DISTRIBUTIONS OF ALLELIC DATA FROM VNTR LOCI, FOR USE IN FORENSIC COMPARISONS+BUDOWLE, B; GIUSTI, AM; WAYE, JS; et al.+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS+MAY 1991::Source attribution of a forensic DNA profile+Budowle, B.; Chakraborty, R.; Carmody, G.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Monson, K.

Questioning a courtroom proof of the uniqueness of fingerprints,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,DEC 2003,21,20,"Forensic scientists or analysts concerned with ""individualization"" often presume that features such as fingerprint minutia are unique to each individual. In the United States, defendants in criminal cases have been demanding proof of such assumptions. In at least two cases, the government of the United States has successfully relied on an unpublished statistical study prepared specifically for litigation to demonstrate the uniqueness of fingerprints. This article suggests that the study is neither designed nor executed in a way that can show whether an individual's fingerprint impressions are unique.","forensic statistics,individualization,probability evidence,fingerprints",SCIENCE,"Kaye, DH@Arizona State Univ, Ctr Study Law Sci & Technol, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Kaye, DH@Arizona State University",not exist,"no title+Aitken, C.

Sentencing illicit drug traffickers: How do the courts handle random sampling issues?,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,DEC 2003,40,1,"While many European justice systems distinguish between possession of and trafficking in illicit drugs, sentencing in drug cases in those countries tends not to depend (at least formally) upon the quantity of drugs seized from a defendant, but rather on the circumstances in which the defendant was found with drugs. Courts in the United States, on the other hand, penalize those convicted of drug crimes through an elaborate system of sentencing rules and guidelines. These sentences depend only upon the amount of drugs (possibly adjusted for circumstances) and the defendant's criminal history. Because of the enormous amount of work needed to determine drug type and quantity in each case, sampling the evidence and estimates of drug quantity have been accepted in most courts in the United States. During the last two years, several major developments in U.S. federal sentencing have taken place. It all started in June 2000 with the Supreme Court case Apprendi v. New Jersey, in which Justice O'Connor, in dissent, termed a ""watershed in constitutional law"". Prior to Apprendi, a judge would sentence a convicted drug trafficker to imprisonment using the preponderance standard of proof on the quantities of drugs seized. The affect of Apprendi is to make more juries decide the quantity of drugs by the reasonable doubt standard. Although Apprendi had nothing to do with illicit drugs, the implication now is that all federal sentencing protocols are under revision. Since Apprendi was decided, huge numbers of cases involving convicted drug traffickers have relied upon its reasoning on appeal, with the result that a ruling from the Supreme Court on further clarification of this issue is expected. This article discusses the impact so far of Apprendi on statistical issues involved in estimating total drug quantity and considers possible future directions under the changing protocols.","controlled substances,drug laws,federal sentencing guidelines,forensic statistics,homogeneity,multistage sampling,random sampling,standards of proof",SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE,"Izenman, AJ@Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA","Izenman, AJ@Temple University@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)",not exist,"Sampling - How big a sample?+Aitken, CGG+JOURNAL OF FORENSIC SCIENCES+JUL 1999::no title+BEAUPRE B+USA TODAY       0820+1996::Annotated bibliography of composite sampling part A: 1936-92+Boswell, MT; Gore, SD; Lovison, G; et al.+ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL STATISTICS+MAR 1996::no title+*BRIT STAND+5309 BS+1993::no title+*BUR JUST ASS+NJ153853 US DEP JUST+1996::no title+Cochran, WG.+Sampling techniques+1977::REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLING OF STREET DRUG EXHIBITS+COLON, M; RODRIGUEZ, G; DIAZ, RO+JOURNAL OF FORENSIC SCIENCES+MAY 1993::ON THE PRESENTATION OF THE RESULTS OF SAMPLE SURVEYS AS LEGAL EVIDENCE+DEMING, WE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1954::no title+*DEP JUST+DEA BRIEFS BACKG LAW+2002::no title+Desu, M.

Statistical issues arising in disparate impact cases and the use of the expectancy curve in assessing the validity of pre-employment tests,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,DEC 2003,31,2,"Disparate impact cases concern the potential adverse effect seemingly neutral employment practices, such as passing a pre-employment test or possessing a fixed level of education, have on minority applicants. Their purpose is to eliminate discrimination by subterfuge, i.e., imposing a requirement that eliminates many minority individuals who could do the job but who do not meet the requirement. When a significantly higher fraction of applicants from minority groups fail the requirement compared to majority applicants, the requirement needs to be shown to be job-related. Statistical techniques used at the various stages of a disparate impact claim are described. Properties of the expectancy curve, which describes the utility of a pre-employment test and helps in defining a band of scores defining ""equivalently skilled"" applicants are discussed.","banding,correlation,disparate impact,expectancy curve,grouping,pseudo-likelihood,total gain","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,INTERVAL ESTIMATION,DISCRIMINATION,EMPLOYMENT","Gastwirth, JL@George Washington Univ, Dept Stat, Washington, DC 20052 USA@Macalester Coll, Dept Math, St Paul, MN 55105 USA@NHLBI, Off Biostat Res, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA::Miao, WW@George Washington Univ, Dept Stat, Washington, DC 20052 USA@Macalester Coll, Dept Math, St Paul, MN 55105 USA@NHLBI, Off Biostat Res, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA::Zheng, G@George Washington Univ, Dept Stat, Washington, DC 20052 USA@Macalester Coll, Dept Math, St Paul, MN 55105 USA@NHLBI, Off Biostat Res, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Gastwirth, JL@George Washington University@Macalester College@NIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI)@National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA::Miao, WW@George Washington University@Macalester College@NIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI)@National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA::Zheng, G@George Washington University@Macalester College@NIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI)@National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA",not exist,"Approximate is better than ""exact"" for interval estimation of binomial proportions+Agresti, A; Coull, BA+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1998::no title+ARVEY RD+FAIRNESS SELECTING E+1979::no title+BALDUS DC+STAT PROF EMPLOYMENT+1980::IS THE TEST CONTENT-VALID - OR, DOES IT REALLY MEASURE A CONSTRUCT+BARRETT, RS+EMPLOYEE RELATIONS LAW JOURNAL+1981::no title+BARTHOLET E+HARVARD LAW REV+1982::no title+BRESLOW NE+WHO IARC SCI PUBLICA+1980::Interval estimation for a binomial proportion - Comment - Rejoinder+Brown, LD; Cai, TT; DasGupta, A; et al.+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 2001::ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE LIKELIHOOD RATIO+CHERNOFF, H+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1954::no title+Finkelstein, M.

Proper and improper multiple imputation,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,DEC 2003,11,39,"Multiple imputation has become viewed as a general solution to missing data problems in statistics. However, in order to lead to consistent asymptotically normal estimators, correct variance estimators and valid tests, the imputations must be proper. So far it seems that only Bayesian multiple imputation, i.e. using a Bayesian predictive distribution to generate the imputations, or approximately Bayesian multiple imputations has been shown to lead to proper imputations in some settings. In this paper, we shall see that Bayesian multiple imputation does not generally lead to proper multiple imputations. Furthermore, it will be argued that for general statistical use, Bayesian multiple imputation is inefficient even when it is proper.","missing data,multiple imputation,congeniality,efficiency",,"Nielsen, SF@Univ Copenhagen, Dept Appl Math & Stat, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark","Nielsen, SF@University of Copenhagen",not exist,"Inference and monitoring convergence+Gelman, A.+Markov chain Monte Carlo in practice+1996::IGNORABILITY AND COARSE DATA+HEITJAN, DF; RUBIN, DB+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1991::MULTIPLE-IMPUTATION INFERENCES WITH UNCONGENIAL SOURCES OF INPUT+MENG, XL+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+NOV 1994::Relative coarsening at random+Nielsen, SF+STATISTICA NEERLANDICA+MAR 2000::Inference for imputation estimators+Robins, JM; Wang, NS+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 2000::no title+Rubin, D.

Discussion: Efficiency and self-efficiency with multiple imputation inference,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,DEC 2003,0,11,"By closely examining the examples provided in Nielsen (2003), this paper further explores the relationship between self-efficiency (Meng, 1994) and the validity of Rubin's multiple imputation (RMI) variance combining rule. The RMI variance combining rule is based on the common assumption/intuition that the efficiency of our estimators decreases when we have less data. However, there are estimation procedures that will do the opposite, that is, they can produce more efficient estimators with less data. Self-efficiency is a theoretical formulation for excluding such procedures. When a user, typically unaware of the hidden self-inefficiency of his choice, adopts a self-inefficient complete-data estimation procedure to conduct an RMI inference, the theoretical validity of his inference becomes a complex issue, as we demonstrate. We also propose a diagnostic tool for assessing potential self-inefficiency and the bias in the RMI variance estimator, at the outset of RMI inference, by constructing a convenient proxy to the RMI point estimator.","congeniality,incomplete data,missing data,variance decomposition",,"Meng, XL@Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA@Inst Mexicano Petr, Mexico City 07730, DF, Mexico::Romero, M@Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA@Inst Mexicano Petr, Mexico City 07730, DF, Mexico","Meng, XL@Harvard University@Instituto Mexicano del Petroleo::Romero, M@Harvard University@Instituto Mexicano del Petroleo",not exist,

Hierarchical models in environmental science,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2003.tb00192.x,AUG 2003,68,122,"Environmental systems are complicated. They include very intricate spatio-temporal processes, interacting on a wide variety of scales. There is increasingly vast amounts of data for such processes from geographical information systems, remote sensing platforms, monitoring networks, and computer models. In addition, often there is a great variety of scientific knowledge available for such systems, from partial differential equations based on first principles to panel surveys. It is argued that it is not generally adequate to consider such processes from a joint perspective. Instead, the processes often must be considered as a coherently linked system of conditional models. This paper provides a brief overview of hierarchical approaches applied to environmental processes. The key elements of such models can be considered in three general stages, the data stage, process stage, and parameter stage. In each stage, complicated dependence structure is mitigated by conditioning. For example, the data stage can incorporate measurement errors as well as multiple datasets with varying supports. The process and parameter stages can allow spatial and spatio-temporal processes as well as the direct inclusion of scientific knowledge. The paper concludes with a discussion of some outstanding problems in hierarchical modelling of environmental systems, including the need for new collaboration approaches.","Bayesian,CAR,change of support,climate,co-kriging,conditional,convolution,dynamic,Markov random field,MCMC,ozone,PDE,spatial,spatio-temporal,spectral","STATIONARY COVARIANCE FUNCTIONS,MARKOV RANDOM-FIELDS,SPACE-TIME MODELS,STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS,KALMAN FILTER,PREDICTION,SYSTEMS,INTERPOLATION,EXPOSURE,DISEASE","Wikle, CK@Univ Missouri, Dept Stat, Columbia, MO 65203 USA","Wikle, CK@University of Missouri Columbia@University of Missouri System",not exist,"no title+BERLINER LM+IN PRESS J GEOPHYSIC+2003::Long-lead prediction of Pacific SSTs via Bayesian dynamic modeling+Berliner, LM; Wikle, CK; Cressie, N+JOURNAL OF CLIMATE+NOV 15 2000::Hierarchical Bayesian time series models+Berliner, LM+MAXIMUM ENTROPY AND BAYESIAN METHODS+1996::SPATIAL INTERACTION AND STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS OF LATTICE SYSTEMS+BESAG, J+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1974::BAYESIAN COMPUTATION AND STOCHASTIC-SYSTEMS+BESAG, J; GREEN, P; HIGDON, D; et al.+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+FEB 1995::Spatial Poisson regression for health and exposure data measured at disparate resolutions+Best, NG; Ickstadt, K; Wolpert, RL+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2000::The Community Climate System Model+Blackmon, M; Boville, B; Bryan, F; et al.+BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY+NOV 2001::Blur-generated non-separable space-time models+Brown, PE; Karesen, KF; Roberts, GO; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2000::Space-time calibration of radar rainfall data+Brown, PE; Diggle, PJ; Lord, ME; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2001::MULTIVARIATE SPATIAL INTERPOLATION AND EXPOSURE TO AIR-POLLUTANTS+BROWN, PJ; LE, ND; ZIDEK, JV+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+DEC 1994::no title+Carlin, BP; Louis, TA.+Bayes and Empirical Bayes Methods for Data Analysis+2000::MULTISCALE SYSTEMS, KALMAN FILTERS, AND RICCATI-EQUATIONS+CHOU, KC; WILLSKY, AS; NIKOUKHAH, R+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+MAR 1994::Bayesian methods for mapping disease risk+Clayton, D.; Bernardinelli, L.+Geographical and Environmental Epidemiology: Methods for Small Area Studies+1992::no title+CLIFF, A.

Statistical assessment of numerical models,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,AUG 2003,42,13,"Evaluation of physically based computer models for air quality applications is crucial to assist in control strategy selection. The high risk of getting the wrong control strategy has costly economic and social consequences. The objective comparison of modeled concentrations with observed field data is one approach to assessment of model performance. For dry deposition fluxes and concentrations of air pollutants there is a very limited supply of evaluation data sets. We develop a formal method for evaluation of the performance of numerical models, which can be implemented even when the field measurements are very sparse. This approach is applied to a current U.S. Environmental Protection Agency air quality model. In other cases, exemplified by an ozone study from the California Central Valley, the observed field is relatively data rich, and more or less standard geostatistical tools can be used to compare model to data. Yet another situation is when the cost of model runs is prohibitive, and a statistical approach to approximating the model output is needed. We describe two ways of obtaining such approximations.

A common technical issue in the assessment of environmental numerical models is the need for tools to estimate nonstationary spatial covariance structures.

Sequential data assimilation techniques in oceanography,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2003.tb00194.x,AUG 2003,50,125,We review recent developments of sequential data assimilation techniques used in oceanography to integrate spatio-temporal observations into numerical models describing physical and ecological dynamics. Theoretical aspects from the simple case of linear dynamics to the general case of nonlinear dynamics are described from a geostatistical point-of-view. Current methods derived from the Kalman filter are presented from the least complex to the most general and perspectives for nonlinear estimation by sequential importance resampling filters are discussed. Furthermore an extension of the ensemble Kalman filter to transformed Gaussian variables is presented and illustrated using a simplified ecological model. The described methods are designed for predicting over geographical regions using a high spatial resolution under the practical constraint of keeping computing time sufficiently low to obtain the prediction before the fact. Therefore the paper focuses on widely used and computationally efficient methods.,"data assimilation,geostatistics,Kalman filter,non-linear dynamical systems,state-space models,ecological model","EXTENDED KALMAN FILTER,SUBSPACE STATISTICAL ESTIMATION,OCEAN MODEL,FORMULATION,DYNAMICS,SCHEMES,INVERSE,SYSTEMS","Bertino, L@Nansen Environm & Remote Sensing Ctr, Bergen, Norway@Ecole Mines, Ctr Geostat, Paris, France::Evensen, G@Nansen Environm & Remote Sensing Ctr, Bergen, Norway@Ecole Mines, Ctr Geostat, Paris, France::Wackernagel, H@Nansen Environm & Remote Sensing Ctr, Bergen, Norway@Ecole Mines, Ctr Geostat, Paris, France","Bertino, L@Unknow@PSL Research University Paris@MINES ParisTech::Evensen, G@Unknow@PSL Research University Paris@MINES ParisTech::Wackernagel, H@Unknow@PSL Research University Paris@MINES ParisTech","Bertino, Laurent@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1220-7207","An ensemble Kalman filter with a complex marine ecosystem model: hindcasting phytoplankton in the Cretan Sea+Allen, J.

Health effects of air pollution: A statistical review,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,AUG 2003,162,88,"We critically review and compare epidemiological designs and statistical approaches to estimate associations between air pollution and health. More specifically, we aim to address the following questions:

1. Which epidemiological designs and statistical methods are available to estimate associations between air pollution and health?

2. What are the recent methodological advances in the estimation of the health effects of air pollution in time series studies?

3. What are the the main methodological challenges and future research opportunities relevant to regulatory policy?

In question 1, we identify strengths and limitations of time series, cohort, case-crossover and panel sampling designs. In question 2, we focus on time series studies and we review statistical methods for: 1) combining information across multiple locations to estimate overall air pollution effects; 2) estimating the health effects of air pollution taking into account of model uncertainties; 3) investigating the consequences of exposure measurement error in the estimation of the health effects of air pollution; and 4) estimating air pollution-health exposure-response curves. Here, we also discuss the extent to which these statistical contributions have addressed key substantive questions. In question 3, within a set of policy-relevant-questions, we identify research opportunities and point out current data limitations.","time series,air pollution,epidemiological designs,hierarchical models,exposure measurement error,model choice","CASE-CROSSOVER DESIGN,EXPOSURE MEASUREMENT ERROR,SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES,MARGINAL REGRESSION-MODELS,LONG-TERM EXPOSURE,LARGEST US CITIES,PARTICULATE MATTER,DAILY MORTALITY,TIME-SERIES,HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS","Dominici, F@Johns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA@Univ Washington, Sch Publ Hlth & Community Med, Dept Biostat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA@Univ Washington, Sch Publ Hlth & Community Med, Dept Environm Hlth, Seattle, WA 98195 USA@Duke Univ, Inst Stat & Decis Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA::Sheppard, L@Johns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA@Univ Washington, Sch Publ Hlth & Community Med, Dept Biostat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA@Univ Washington, Sch Publ Hlth & Community Med, Dept Environm Hlth, Seattle, WA 98195 USA@Duke Univ, Inst Stat & Decis Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA::Clyde, M@Johns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA@Univ Washington, Sch Publ Hlth & Community Med, Dept Biostat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA@Univ Washington, Sch Publ Hlth & Community Med, Dept Environm Hlth, Seattle, WA 98195 USA@Duke Univ, Inst Stat & Decis Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Dominici, F@Johns Hopkins University@Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health@University of Washington Seattle@University of Washington@University of Washington Seattle@University of Washington@Duke University::Sheppard, L@Johns Hopkins University@Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health@University of Washington Seattle@University of Washington@University of Washington Seattle@University of Washington@Duke University::Clyde, M@Johns Hopkins University@Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health@University of Washington Seattle@University of Washington@University of Washington Seattle@University of Washington@Duke University",not exist,"Information theory and extension of the maximum likelihood principle+Akaike, H.+2 INT S INF THEOR+1973::THE DISTRIBUTED LAG BETWEEN CAPITAL APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPENDITURES+ALMON, S+ECONOMETRICA+1965::BIAS ARISING IN CASE-CONTROL STUDIES FROM SELECTION OF CONTROLS FROM OVERLAPPING GROUPS+AUSTIN, H; FLANDERS, WD; ROTHMAN, KJ+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+SEP 1989::Health effects of outdoor air pollution+Bascom, R; Bromberg, PA; Hill, C; et al.+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE+FEB 1996::Health effects of outdoor air pollution+Bascom, R; Bromberg, PA; Costa, DA; et al.+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE+JAN 1996::Selection bias and confounding in case-crossover analyses of environmental time-series data+Bateson, TF; Schwartz, J+EPIDEMIOLOGY+NOV 2001::Control for seasonal variation and time trend in case crossover studies of acute effects of environmental exposures+Bateson, TF; Schwartz, J+EPIDEMIOLOGY+SEP 1999::Spatial Poisson regression for health and exposure data measured at disparate resolutions+Best, NG; Ickstadt, K; Wolpert, RL+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2000::The lag structure between particulate air pollution and respiratory and cardiovascular deaths in 10 US cities+Braga, ALF; Zanobetti, A; Schwartz, J+JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE+NOV 2001::APPROXIMATE INFERENCE IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS+BRESLOW, NE; CLAYTON, DG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::Mapping urban air pollution using GIS: a regression-based approach+Briggs, DJ; Collins, S; Elliott, P; et al.+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE+OCT-NOV 1997::AIR-POLLUTION EFFECTS ON HOSPITAL ADMISSION RATES - A RANDOM EFFECTS MODELING APPROACH+BURNETT, R; KREWSKI, D+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+DEC 1994::Adjusting for temporal variation in the analysis of parallel time series of health and environmental variables+Cakmak, S; Burnett, R; Krewski, D+JOURNAL OF EXPOSURE ANALYSIS AND ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY+APR-JUN 1998::Methods for detecting and estimating population threshold concentrations for air pollution-related mortality with exposure measurement error+Cakmak, S; Burnett, RT; Krewski, D+RISK ANALYSIS+JUN 1999::no title+Carlin, B; Louis, T.+Bayes and empirical Bayes methods for data analysis+1996::no title+CARLIN BP+ASA P BIOM SECT AL V+1997::no title+Carroll, R.

Statistical regularity and free will: L.A.J. Quetelet and P.A. Nekrasov,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,AUG 2003,48,8,"In the 19th century, causes of empirically observed stability of averages in settings relating to human behaviour were a topic of intense discussion in western Europe. This followed an extensive study of empirical stability by the founder of modern statistics (and of the International Statistical Institute) L.A.J. Quetelet, published in 1835, in what he called ""Social Physics"". The eminent mathematician of strong probabilistic and philosophical inclination and Russian Orthodox religious belief, P.A. Nekrasov, took up and modified Quetelet's Social Physics in 1902, with (social) independence seen as prime cause of statistical regularity. Our paper focuses on the role free will plays in the statistical writings of Quetelet and of Nekrasov.

Bridging the gap between different statistical approaches: An integrated framework for modelling,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,AUG 2003,56,3,"This paper proposes a template for modelling complex datasets that integrates traditional statistical modelling approaches with more recent advances in statistics and modelling through an exploratory framework. Our approach builds on the well-known and long standing traditional idea of 'good practice in statistics' by establishing a comprehensive framework for modelling that focuses on exploration, prediction, interpretation and reliability assessment, a relatively new idea that allows individual assessment of predictions.

The integrated framework we present comprises two stages. The first involves the use of exploratory methods to help visually understand the data and identify a parsimonious set of explanatory variables. The second encompasses a two step modelling process, where the use of non-parametric methods such as decision trees and generalized additive models are promoted to identify important variables and their modelling relationship with the response before a final predictive model is considered. We focus on fitting the predictive model using parametric, non-parametric and Bayesian approaches.

This paper is motivated by a medical problem where interest focuses on developing a risk stratification system for morbidity of 1,710 cardiac patients given a suite of demographic, clinical and preoperative variables. Although the methods we use are applied specifically to this case study, these methods can be applied across any field, irrespective of the type of response.","binary response,cardiac morbidity,decision trees,generalized additive models,generalized linear models,multivariate adaptive regression splines,multiple additive regression trees reliability","ADAPTIVE REGRESSION SPLINES,CARDIAC-SURGERY,LOGISTIC-REGRESSION,MARS,RISK,CLASSIFICATION,TREES,SEA","Kuhnert, PM@Prince Charles Hosp, Dept Cardiac Surg, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia@Univ Queensland, Ctr Ecol, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia@Univ Newcastle, Sch Math & Phys Sci, Newcastle, NSW 2308, Australia::Mengersen, K@Prince Charles Hosp, Dept Cardiac Surg, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia@Univ Queensland, Ctr Ecol, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia@Univ Newcastle, Sch Math & Phys Sci, Newcastle, NSW 2308, Australia::Tesar, P@Prince Charles Hosp, Dept Cardiac Surg, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia@Univ Queensland, Ctr Ecol, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia@Univ Newcastle, Sch Math & Phys Sci, Newcastle, NSW 2308, Australia","Kuhnert, PM@Prince Charles Hospital@University of Queensland@University of Newcastle::Mengersen, K@Prince Charles Hospital@University of Queensland@University of Newcastle::Tesar, P@Prince Charles Hospital@University of Queensland@University of Newcastle","Kuhnert, Petra@D-1883-2009::Mengersen, Kerrie@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8625-9168","Spatiotemporal modelling for the annual egg production method of stock assessment using generalized additive models+Augustin, NH; Borchers, DL; Clarke, ED; et al.+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES+DEC 1998::Current approaches to modelling the environmental niche of eucalypts: Implication for management of forest biodiversity+Austin, MP; Meyers, JA+FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT+SEP 1996::Bedside estimation of risk as an aid for decision-making in cardiac surgery+Bernstein, AD; Parsonnet, V+ANNALS OF THORACIC SURGERY+MAR 2000::no title+BESAG J+STAT SCI+1995::Combining models of health and exposure data: the SAVIAH study+Best, NG; Ickstadt, K; Wolpert, RL<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Briggs, DJ</span>.+Spatial epidemiology: methods and applications+2000::Arcing classifiers+Breiman, L+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 1998::no title+Breiman, L.+Classification and regression trees+1984::Bagging predictors+Breiman, L+MACHINE LEARNING+AUG 1996::Bayesian CART model search+Chipman, HA; George, EI; McCulloch, RE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1998::Forecasting exchange rates using TSMARS+De Gooijer, JG; Ray, BK; Krager, H+JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MONEY AND FINANCE+JUN 1998::Classification and regression trees: A powerful yet simple technique for ecological data analysis+De'ath, G; Fabricius, KE+ECOLOGY+NOV 2000::A Bayesian CART algorithm+Denison, DGT; Mallick, BK; Smith, AFM+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1998::Bayesian MARS+Denison, DGT; Mallick, BK; Smith, AFM+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+DEC 1998::A COMPARISON OF 2 NONPARAMETRIC-ESTIMATION SCHEMES - MARS AND NEURAL NETWORKS+DEVEAUX, RD; PSICHOGIOS, DC; UNGAR, LH+COMPUTERS &amp; CHEMICAL ENGINEERING+AUG 1993::MODELING OF TOPOGRAPHIC EFFECTS ON ANTARCTIC SEA-ICE USING MULTIVARIATE ADAPTIVE REGRESSION SPLINES+DEVEAUX, RD; GORDON, AL; COMISO, JC; et al.+JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS+NOV 15 1993::Genetic analysis of the age at menopause by using estimating equations and Bayesian random effects models+Do, KA; Broom, BM; Kuhnert, P; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+MAY 15 2000::The cardiac anesthesia risk evaluation score - A clinically useful predictor of mortality and morbidity after cardiac surgery+Dupuis, JY; Wang, F; Nathan, H; et al.+ANESTHESIOLOGY+FEB 2001::Environmental models of cetacean abundance: Reducing uncertainty in population trends+Forney, KA+CONSERVATION BIOLOGY+OCT 2000::Patterns in the spawning of cod (Gadus morhua L.), sole (Solea solea L.) and plaice (Pleuronectes platessa L.) in the Irish Sea as determined by generalized additive modelling+Fox, CJ; O'Brien, CM; Dickey-Collas, M; et al.+FISHERIES OCEANOGRAPHY+MAR 2000::MODERN NONLINEAR-REGRESSION METHODS+FRANK, IE+CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS+JAN 1995::Experiments with a new boosting algorithm+Freund, Y.; Schapire, R.E.+Machine Learning.

A Bayesian formulation of exploratory data analysis and goodness-of-fit testing,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,AUG 2003,45,90,"Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and Bayesian inference (or, more generally, complex statistical modeling)-which are generally considered as unrelated statistical paradigms-can be particularly effective in combination. In this paper, we present a Bayesian framework for EDA based on posterior predictive checks. We explain how posterior predictive simulations can be used to create reference distributions for EDA graphs, and how this approach resolves some theoretical problems in Bayesian data analysis. We show how the generalization of Bayesian inference to include replicated data y(rep) and replicated parameters theta(rep) follows a long tradition of generalizations in Bayesian theory.

On the theoretical level, we present a predictive Bayesian formulation of goodness-of-fit testing, distinguishing between p-values (posterior probabilities that specified antisymmetric discrepancy measures will exceed 0) and u-values (data summaries with uniform sampling distributions). We explain that p-values, unlike u-values, are Bayesian probability statements in that they condition on observed data.

Having reviewed the general theoretical framework, we discuss the implications for statistical graphics and exploratory data analysis, with the goal being to unify exploratory data analysis with more formal statistical methods based on probability models. We interpret various graphical displays as posterior predictive checks and discuss how Bayesian inference can be used to determine reference distributions.

The goal of this work is not to downgrade descriptive statistics, or to suggest they be replaced by Bayesian modeling, but rather to suggest how exploratory data analysis fits into the probability-modeling paradigm.

We conclude with a discussion of the implications for practical Bayesian inference. In particular, we anticipate that Bayesian software can be generalized to draw simulations of replicated data and parameters from their posterior predictive distribution, and these can in turn be used to calibrate EDA graphs.","bootstrap,Fisher's exact test,graphics,mixture model,model checking,multiple imputation,prior predictive check,posterior predictive check,p-value,u-value","VARIANCE-COMPONENTS,MODEL,INFERENCE,REGRESSION","Gelman, A@Columbia Univ, Dept Stat, New York, NY 10027 USA","Gelman, A@Columbia University",not exist,"no title+Berger, J.+Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis+1985::no title+BERKHOF J+POSTERIOR PREDICTIVE+2002::no title+BOX, G.

Some aspects of neutral to right priors,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,AUG 2003,21,4,"Neutral to right priors are generalizations of Dirichlet process priors that fit in well with right-censored data. These priors are naturally induced by increasing processes with independent increments which, in turn, may be viewed as priors for the cumulative hazard function. This connection together with the Levy representation of independent increment processes provides a convenient means of studying properties of neutral to right priors.

This article is a review of the theoretical aspects of neutral to right priors and provides a number of new results on their structural properties. Notable among the new results are characterizations of neutral to right priors in terms of the posterior and the cumulative hazard function. We also show that neutral to right priors are of the following nature: Consistency of Bayes' estimates implies consistency of the posterior, and posterior-consistency for complete observations automatically yields posterior-consistency for right-censored data.","neutral to right,beta process,beta-Stacy process,posterior consistency,cumulative hazard function,Bayesian nonparametric inference,independent increment process,right-censored observations","BETA-PROCESSES,DISTRIBUTIONS,MODELS","Dey, J@Wayne State Univ, Detroit, MI 48202 USA@Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA::Erickson, R@Wayne State Univ, Detroit, MI 48202 USA@Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA::Ramamoorthi, RV@Wayne State Univ, Detroit, MI 48202 USA@Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Dey, J@Wayne State University@Michigan State University::Erickson, R@Wayne State University@Michigan State University::Ramamoorthi, RV@Wayne State University@Michigan State University",not exist,"DISCRIMINATION OF POISSON PROCESSES+BROWN, M+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1971::CONCEPTS OF INDEPENDENCE FOR PROPORTIONS WITH A GENERALIZATION OF DIRICHLET DISTRIBUTION+CONNOR, RJ; MOSIMANN, JE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1969::REGRESSION MODELS AND LIFE-TABLES+COX, DR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1972::Implementation of Bayesian non-parametric inference based on beta processes+Damien, P; Laud, PW; Smith, AFM+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+MAR 1996::no title+DEY DK+PRACTICAL NONPARAMET+1998::ON INCONSISTENT BAYES ESTIMATES OF LOCATION+DIACONIS, P; FREEDMAN, D+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+MAR 1986::TAILFREE AND NEUTRAL RANDOM PROBABILITIES AND THEIR POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTIONS+DOKSUM, K+ANNALS OF PROBABILITY+1974::BAYESIAN NONPARAMETRIC ESTIMATION BASED ON CENSORED DATA+FERGUSON, TS; PHADIA, EG+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1979::PRIOR DISTRIBUTIONS ON SPACES OF PROBABILITY MEASURES+FERGUSON, TS+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1974::BAYESIAN ANALYSIS OF SOME NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS+FERGUSON, TS+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1973::no title+Ghosh, JK; Ramamoorthi, RV.+Bayesian nonparametrics+2003::A SURVEY OF PRODUCT-INTEGRATION WITH A VIEW TOWARD APPLICATION IN SURVIVAL ANALYSIS+GILL, RD; JOHANSEN, S+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1990::NONPARAMETRIC BAYES ESTIMATORS BASED ON BETA PROCESSES IN MODELS FOR LIFE-HISTORY DATA+HJORT, NL+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+SEP 1990::no title+ITO K+LECT NOTES SERIES+1969::On posterior consistency of survival models+Kim, Y; Lee, J+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2001::no title+Meyer, P.

Statistical surveillance. Optimality and methods,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2003.tb00205.x,AUG 2003,141,80,"Different criteria of optimality are used in different subcultures of statistical surveillance. One aim with this review is to bridge the gap between the different areas. The shortcomings of some criteria of optimality are demonstrated by their implications. Some commonly used methods are examined in detail, with respect to optimality. The examination is made for a standard situation in order to focus on the inferential principles. A uniform presentation of methods, by expressions of likelihood ratios, facilitates the comparisons between methods. The correspondences between criteria of optimality and methods are examined. The situations and parameter values for which some commonly used methods have optimality properties are thus determined. A linear approximation of the full likelihood ratio method, which satisfies several criteria of optimality, is presented. This linear approximation is used to examine when linear methods are approximately optimal. Methods for complicated situations are reviewed with respect to optimality and robustness.","change-point,control chart,CUSUM,EWMA,likelihood ratio,monitoring,quality control,repeated decisions,shewhart,statistical process control,stopping rule","EWMA CONTROL CHARTS,AVERAGE CONTROL CHARTS,QUALITY-CONTROL PROCEDURE,WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGES,LIKELIHOOD RATIO METHODS,CONTROL SCHEMES,CHANGE-POINT,RUN-LENGTH,GAUSSIAN-PROCESSES,CUSUM PROCEDURE","Frisen, M@Univ Gothenburg, Dept Stat, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden","Frisen, M@University of Gothenburg",not exist,"A comparison of control charting procedures for monitoring process dispersion+Acosta-Mejia, CA; Pignatiello, JJ; Rao, BV+IIE TRANSACTIONS+JUN 1999::Monitoring reduction in variability with the range+Acosta-Mejia, CA+IIE TRANSACTIONS+JUN 1998::EVALUATION OF CONTROL CHARTS UNDER LINEAR TREND+AERNE, LA; CHAMP, CW; RIGDON, SE+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1991::EWMA control charts for the smallest and largest observations+Amin, RW; Wolff, H; Besenfelder, W; et al.+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 1999::no title+ANDERSSON E+20015 GOT U DEP STAT+2001::Monitoring cyclical processes.

Bootstrap methods for time series,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,AUG 2003,69,88,"The bootstrap is a method for estimating the distribution of an estimator or test statistic by resampling one's data or a model estimated from the data. The methods that are available for implementing the bootstrap and the accuracy of bootstrap estimates depend on whether the data are an independent random sample or a time series. This paper is concerned with the application of the bootstrap to time-series data when one does not have a finite-dimensional parametric model that reduces the data generation process to independent random sampling. We review the methods that have been proposed for implementing the bootstrap in this situation and discuss the accuracy of these methods relative to that of first-order asymptotic approximations. We argue that methods for implementing the bootstrap with time-series data are not as well understood as methods for data that are independent random samples. Although promising bootstrap methods for time series are available, there is a considerable need for further research in the application of the bootstrap to time series. We describe some of the important unsolved problems.","resampling,block bootstrap,asymptotic approximation confidence interval","CONSISTENT COVARIANCE-MATRIX,BLOCK BOOTSTRAP,DEPENDENT DATA,STATIONARY OBSERVATIONS,MOMENTS ESTIMATORS,GENERALIZED-METHOD,SIEVE BOOTSTRAP,ORDER,HETEROSKEDASTICITY,AUTOREGRESSIONS","Hardle, W@Humboldt Univ, CASE, Berlin, Germany@Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL USA@Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Stat Math, D-3300 Braunschweig, Germany::Horowitz, J@Humboldt Univ, CASE, Berlin, Germany@Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL USA@Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Stat Math, D-3300 Braunschweig, Germany::Kreiss, JP@Humboldt Univ, CASE, Berlin, Germany@Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL USA@Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Stat Math, D-3300 Braunschweig, Germany","Hardle, W@Humboldt University of Berlin@Northwestern University@Braunschweig University of Technology::Horowitz, J@Humboldt University of Berlin@Northwestern University@Braunschweig University of Technology::Kreiss, JP@Humboldt University of Berlin@Northwestern University@Braunschweig University of Technology",not exist,"no title+ANDREWS DWK+1334 YAL U COWL FDN+2001::no title+ANDREWS DWK+1370 YAL U COWL FDN+2002::Higher-order improvements of a computationally attractive k-step bootstrap for extremum estimators+Andrews, DWK+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 2002::HETEROSKEDASTICITY AND AUTOCORRELATION CONSISTENT COVARIANCE-MATRIX ESTIMATION+ANDREWS, DWK+ECONOMETRICA+MAY 1991::no title+Beran, R.

It introduces three slightly different approaches with different emphasis on describing the emergence and diffusion of ICT and the respective economic and social change. These are termed the indicators approach, the new economy approach and the intellectual capital approach. The paper also discusses the basic requirements for the establishment of a new statistical system, as well as the present obstacles and problems of this work.

OECD efforts to address the measurement and policy challenges posed by the information society,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,APR 2003,8,0,"The OECD has acted as a forum for the discussion of policies regarding the information society for over 20-years, producing guidelines and recommendations in areas such as privacy of personal information, computer security, cryptography, regulatory reform of communications, and most recently on-line consumer protection and the taxation of e-commerce. By and large, this work was undertaken without the benefit of statistical measures. But the economic performance of a number of OECD Member countries during the 1990s underscores that the policy challenges being posed by the information society are increasingly economic in nature-how ICT is affecting productivity, growth rates, inflation, labour markets etc.-necessitating the need for statistically rigorous data. This paper outlines how recent efforts by national statistical offices to improve this situation have allowed researchers to gain new insight into the economic impact associated with ICTs and applications like e-commerce, leading to a number of policy recommendations as to how best to exploit the economic potential of these technologies. The paper ends by outlining important policy issues that require new statistical efforts.","information society,economic impact,societal impact,information economy,ICT value added,policy and statistics,growth",,"Wyckoff, AW@Org Econ Cooperat & Dev, Paris, France","Wyckoff, AW@Unknow",not exist,no title+BALLMER S+CEO MICROSOFT   0711+2001::no title+COLECCHIA A+OECD STI WORKING PAP+2001::no title+ODLYZKO A+FIRSTMONDAY+2001::no title+*OECD+EC SOC IMP EL COMM+1999::no title+*OECD+GLOB INF INFR GLOB I+1996::no title+no author+The New Economy: beyond the Hype+2001::no title+PILAT D+OECD STI WORKING PAP+2001::no title+SCHREYER P+OECD STI WORKING PAP+2000
The citizens' right to information and the duties of a democratic state in modern IT environment - in the light of the UN fundamental principles of official statistics and the ISI Declaration on Statistical Ethics,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,APR 2003,3,2,"Modern information technologies, particularly the technology of very large data bases, Internet and modern mass media, have changed the processes of production, storage and dissemination of information. These technologies have a direct impact on the practical realization of citizens' rights to information. In democratic societies, in modern IT environment, information is produced and disseminated by many social and economic entities. Many producers and disseminators of information do not know or do not obey the criteria which should be met by any information delivered to the public. In this paper the advantages and the threats for the citizens' rights, to information generated by the distribution and globalization of information processes in modern IT environment are discussed.

It seems that for the protection of the citizens' rights to information, there is the need for specification and codification of quality criteria and standards for information produced and disseminated with the use of modern IT. Official statistics may and should play an important,and active role in defining those criteria and standards. Professional ethics of statisticians and of official statistics seems to be the proper basis for that. Ethical principles of statistics are formulated in two basic documents: The fundamental principles of official statistics adopted by the UN Statistical Commission in 1994 and the ISI Declaration on statistical ethics adopted by the ISI in 1985.","official statistics,statistical ethics,standardisation,harmonisation,meta-data,IT environment,citizens' rights to information",,"Olenski, J@Warsaw Univ, Fac Econ, Warsaw, Poland","Olenski, J@University of Warsaw",not exist,no title+*ISI DECL PROF ETH+INT STAT REV+1986::no title+KONECZNY F+WIELOSC CYWILIZACYJ+1932::no title+no author+Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics+1994

These developments have been on both the supply side (ICT industry) and the demand side (use of IT by sector). The content of ABS ICT surveys has changed significantly over the last few years and are expected to develop further in line with industry changes and emerging policy needs.

Recent developments in household collections have been the inclusion of IT use questions in the 2001 Census of Population and Housing and in various ABS social surveys such as Children's Participation in Culture and Leisure Activities. Annual business IT use surveys are now conducted and include topics such as Internet commerce and IT security. Biennial ICT industry surveys are conducted to provide data on ICT production, imports and exports, ICT industry employment, performance and structure information. An Internet activity survey is run every six months and provides regional Internet access details and infrastructure details on Internet service providers.

A major development for 2002-03 will be the compilation of an ICT satellite account.

Official statistics on ICT in Japan,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,APR 2003,3,0,"Taking into account the developments of ICT in recent years, a lot of countries are dealing with the preparation of statistics on ICT.

In Japan, the Basic Law on Formation of an Advanced Information and Telecommunications Network Society (Basic Law on IT) was enforced on January 6, 2001, in which the Government is obliged to prepare official statistics related to ICT.

In Japan, at least 41 kinds of official statistical surveys, including questions related to ICT, have been conducted in the past five years. Their main purpose, survey items and survey methods are various and different from each other. To grasp the new development in IT as a whole, ""IT Indicators in Japan"", which is a new compendium on ICT, was compiled in 2001. Also, ""Information and Communications in Japan"", which is a white paper published in 2001, presented basic data on the extent to which IT has permeated the economic activity and people's lives.

In addition, the 11th revision of the Japan Standard Industrial Classification (JSIC) was published by the Statistical Standards Department, Statistics Bureau, Ministry of Public Management, Home Affairs, Posts and Telecommunications (MPHPT) in March 2002 in response to the change of economy and society including the development of ICT.

The Working Group on Indicators for the Information Society of OECD has been working for several years in order to prepare internationally comparable and statistically measurable ICT indicators and related ICT statistics.

In this paper, an overview of the present situation of Japanese official statistics related to ICT is given with some analysis. In addition, some problems are raised which should be considered from the viewpoint of the necessity and measurability and so on for the appropriate preparation of ICT indicators and e-commerce-related statistics.

""IT; Information Technology"" and ""ICT; Information and Communications Technology"" are often used without any distinction. ""ICT"" is used in this paper except where ""IT"" is used as a proper noun, as it is considered almost the same as ""IT"".

Measuring knowledge development and developing official statistics for the information age,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,APR 2003,39,3,"Measuring knowledge development is a new statistical activity that warrants urgent attention in the light of the current Internet explosion. The Internet creates virtual networks by connecting information nodes, knowledge nexus, people and institutions. The Internet has resulted in an unprecedented proliferation of Information, Communication, Knowledge and Entertainment (ICKE), which has in turn brought about structural changes in all aspects of social, economic and political governance. For public policy formulators, including the statistical community, it is imperative that the knowledge development aspect of ICKE be measured. Being abstract, knowledge is difficult to quantify. However, the manifestations of attributes and variables of any knowledge development activity are measurable. The paper outlines a conceptual framework for achieving this. This proposed framework adopts a socio-technological approach, premised on contemporary information and knowledge development as an integral of the people and technology dimensions. To illustrate the workability of the proposed model, the paper identifies some parameters and variables in the current statistical system, and highlights some new data generated via the Internet Subscriber Study and ICT Exposition Visitor Study. All illustrations refer to Malaysian data. Finally, the paper outlines 'way forward' initiatives for establishing a full-fledged set of information and knowledge development indicators.","data knowledge chain,conceptual framework,measurement parameters,hard and soft factors,Internet Subscriber Study (ISS)",,"Ramachandran, R@Natl Informat Technol Council Secretariat, MIMOS Berhad, Kuala Lumpur 57000, Malaysia","Ramachandran, R@Unknow",not exist,"no title+APRIL D+CONNECTEDNESS SERIES+2000::no title+ASHA RP+IOAS SAT M STAT INF+2001::no title+BEHAN K+UNDERSTANDING INFORM+1990::Organising knowledge in the knowledge development cycle+Bhatt, G.+Journal of Knowledge Management+2000::Knowledge capabilities as the focus of organizational development and strategy+Dawson, R.+Journal of Knowledge Management+2000::no title+*DEP STAT+HOUS EXP SURV+1998::no title+*DEP STAT MAL+EC CENS+2001::no title+*DEP STAT MAL+SOC STAT B+1998::no title+Dickenson, P.; Ellison, J.+Plugging in: The increase of household internet use continuous into 1999+1999::no title+Drucker, P.+The Landmarks of Tomorrow+1959::no title+ELLISON J+CONNECTEDNESS SERIES+2001::no title+HALIM AA+NITC MALAYSIA PUBLIC+2000::no title+HAYWOOD T+INFORICH INFOPOOR AC+1995::no title+HOWKINS J+DEV INFORMATION AGE+1997::no title+JAYANATH+ACCESS EQUITY BENCHM+2000::no title+JESKANENSUNDSTR.H+INT STAT REV+2001::no title+JOHN KJ+NATL INFORMATION TEC+1996::no title+LAUDON KC+INFORMATION TECHNOLO+1995::Measuring market knowledge competence in new product development+Li, T.+Journal of Knowledge Management+1999::The learning economy+Lundvall, B.; Johnson, B.+Journal of Industry Studies+1994::no title+no author+Knowledge Societies: Information Technology for Sustainable Development+1998::no title+MOSES M+COMPUTER AGE 20 YEAR+1979::no title+NIELSON A+INTERNET SUBSCRIBER+2001::no title+NURMELA J+FINNS MODERN INFORMA+1997::no title+*OECD+MEAS PEOPL KNOW HUM+1996::no title+PARJO L+ROAD FINNISH SOC STA+2001::no title+RAHMAN MA+BENGL COMP COUNC C P+1990::no title+RAMACHANDRAN R+11 NAT INF TECHN COU+2001::no title+RAMACHANDRAN R+IAOS SAT M STAT INF+2001::no title+Rogers, M.E.+Diffusion of Innovations+1995::no title+SHARIFFADEEN TMA+BUILDING KNOWLEDGE S+2000::no title+*STAT FINL+ROAD FINN INF SOC+1997::no title+Stewart, T.A.+Intellectual Capital the New Wealth of Organizations+1998::no title+TURNER C+INFORMATION EC BUSIN+2000::no title+*UN+COMP METH HDI+1999::no title+VANDOREN C+HIST KNOWLEDGE PAST+1991::no title+WILLIAMS BK+USING INFORMATION TE+1995::no title+WYCKOFF AW+INT STAT REV+2001::no title+no author+INFORMATION HIGHWAY+2001"

Covariate measurement error in quadratic regression,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,APR 2003,43,18,"We consider quadratic regression models where the explanatory variable is measured with error. The effect of classical measurement error is to flatten the curvature of the estimated function. The effect on the observed turning point depends on the location of the true turning point relative to the population mean of the true predictor. Two methods for adjusting parameter estimates for the measurement error are compared. First, two versions of regression calibration estimation are considered. This approximates the model between the observed variables using the moments of the true explanatory variable given its surrogate measurement. For certain models an expanded regression calibration approximation is exact. The second approach uses moment-based methods which require no assumptions about the distribution of the covariates measured with error. The estimates are compared in a simulation study, and used to examine the sensitivity to measurement error in models relating income inequality to the level of economic development. The simulations indicate that the expanded regression calibration estimator dominates the other estimators when its distributional assumptions are satisfied. When they fail, a small-sample modification of the method-of-moments estimator performs best. Both estimators are sensitive to misspecification of the measurement error model.","corrected score,errors-in-variables,income inequality,kuznets curve,method of moments,regression calibration","IN-VARIABLES MODELS,SIMULATION-EXTRAPOLATION,POLYNOMIAL REGRESSION,CONSUMER DEMAND,FIELLER THEOREM,ENGEL CURVES,LIKELIHOOD,PREDICTORS,ESTIMATOR,SET","Kuha, J@Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Stat, London WC2A 2AE, England@Univ Bristol, Dept Econ, Bristol BS8 1TN, Avon, England::Temple, J@Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Stat, London WC2A 2AE, England@Univ Bristol, Dept Econ, Bristol BS8 1TN, Avon, England","Kuha, J@London School Economics & Political Science@University of London@University of Bristol::Temple, J@London School Economics & Political Science@University of London@University of Bristol",not exist,"INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE ESTIMATOR FOR THE NONLINEAR ERRORS-IN-VARIABLES MODEL+AMEMIYA, Y+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+1985::Quadratic engel curves and consumer demand+Banks, J; Blundell, R; Lewbel, A+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+NOV 1997::MODELS OF FUNCTIONAL-RELATIONSHIP ILLUSTRATED ON ASTRONOMICAL DATA+BARTON, DE; DAVID, FN+BULLETIN OF THE INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL INSTITUTE+1960::WHAT DO WE LEARN ABOUT CONSUMER DEMAND PATTERNS FROM MICRO DATA+BLUNDELL, R; PASHARDES, P; WEBER, G+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+JUN 1993::FIELLER THEOREM AND THE GENERAL LINEAR-MODEL+BUONACCORSI, JP+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+1979::A modified estimating equation approach to correcting for measurement error in regression+Buonaccorsi, JP+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1996::no title+Carroll, R.

"Bayesian international evidence on heavy tails, non-stationarity and asymmetry over the business cycle",INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,APR 2003,34,0,"Although leptokurtosis is fairly common in macroeconomic time series, agreement over what non-normal distributions are plausible, is rare. The paper proposes a linear model that allows for trend versus difference stationarity and asymmetric behavior over the business cycle along with several distributional alternatives for the disturbance terms. It proposes computationally feasible Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to perform Bayesian computations, applies the model to industrial production data of seven industrialized countries, and relies on prior predictive densities to compare models with Student-t, symmetric stable, EGARCH, exponential power family and finite-mixture-of-normals errors. The relationship between unit root inference, asymmetry and leptokurtosis is examined in detail using the exact, finite-sample posteriors corresponding to the different models.","leptokurtosis,model comparison,Markov Chain Carlo,unit roots,asymmetry,business cycles,industrial production","MACROECONOMIC TIME-SERIES,CONDITIONAL HETEROSKEDASTICITY,POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTIONS,MARKOV-CHAINS,TRENDS","Tsionas, EG@Athens Univ Econ & Bus, Dept Econ, Athens 10434, Greece@IMOP, Athens, Greece","Tsionas, EG@Athens University of Economics & Business@Unknow",not exist,"no title+AKRIGAY V+J BUSINESS EC STAT+1989::no title+AKRIGAY V+J BUSINESS EC STAT+1988::Comment on modeling asset returns with alternative stable distributions+Baillie, R.T.+Economet.

Bayesian hypothesis testing: a reference approach,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.2307/1403862,DEC 2002,38,49,"For any probability model M equivalent to {p(x\theta, omega), theta is an element of Theta, omega is an element of Omega} assumed to describe the probabilistic behaviour of data x is an element of X; it is argued that testing whether or not the available data are compatible with the hypothesis H(0) equivalent to (theta = theta(0)) is best considered as a formal decision problem on whether to use(a(0)), or not to use (a(1)), the simpler probability model (or null model) M(0) equivalent to {p(x\theta(0), omega), omega is an element of Omega}, where the loss difference L(a(0), theta, omega) - L(a(1), theta, omega) is proportional to the amount of information delta(theta(0), theta, omega) which would be lost if the simplified model MO were used as a proxy for the assumed model M. For any prior distribution pi(theta, omega), the appropriate normative solution is obtained by rejecting the null model MO whenever the corresponding posterior expectation integral integral delta(theta(0), theta, omega) pi(theta, omega \ x)dtheta domega is sufficiently, large.

Specification of a subjective prior is always difficult, and often polemical, in scientific communication Information theory may be used to specify a prior, the reference prior, which only depends on the assumed model M, and mathematically describes a situation where no prior information is available about the quantity of interest. The reference posterior expectation, d(theta(0), x) = integral delta pi(delta \ x)ddelta, of the amount of information delta(theta(0), theta, omega) which could be lost if the null model were used, provides an attractive non-negative test function, the intrinsic statistic, which is invariant under reparametrization.

The intrinsic statistic d(theta(0), x) is measured in units of information, and it is easily calibrated (for any sample size and any dimensionality) in terms of some average long-likelihood ratios.. The corresponding Bayes decision rule the Bayesian reference criterion (BRC), indicates that the null model M(0) should only be rejected if the posterior expected loss of information from using the simplified model M(0) is too large or, equivalently, if the associated expected average log-likelihood ratio is large enough.

The BRC criterion provides a general reference Bayesian solution to hypothesis testing which does not assume a probability mass concentrated on M(0) and, hence, it is immune to Lindley's paradox. The theory is illustrated within the context of multivariate normal data, where it is shown to avoid Rao's paradox on the inconsistency between univariate and multivariate frequentist hypothesis testing.","amount of information,decision theory,Lindley's paradox,loss function,model criticism,model choice,precise hypothesis testing,Rao's paradox,reference analysis,reference prior","PARADOX,INFERENCE,PRIORS","Bernardo, JM@Univ Valencia, Dept Estadist & 10, E-46100 Burjassot, Valencia, Spain@Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, IIMAS, Mexico City 01000, DF, Mexico::Rueda, R@Univ Valencia, Dept Estadist & 10, E-46100 Burjassot, Valencia, Spain@Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, IIMAS, Mexico City 01000, DF, Mexico","Bernardo, JM@University of Valencia@Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico::Rueda, R@University of Valencia@Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico","Bernardo, Jose M@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3825-9328","On the development of the reference prior method+Berger, J O; Bernardo, J M.+Bayesian Stat.+1992::Testing precise hypotheses+Berger, J.

Nonparametric varying-coefficient models for the analysis of longitudinal data,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.2307/1403863,DEC 2002,54,16,"Longitudinal methods have been widely used in biomedicine and epidemiology to study the patterns of time-varying variables, such as disease progression or trends of health status. Data sets of longitudinal studies usually involve repeatedly measured outcomes and covariates on a set of randomly chosen subjects over time. An important goal of statistical analyses is to evaluate the effects of the covariates, which may or may not depend on time, on the outcomes of interest. Because fully parametric models may be subject to model misspecification and completely unstructured nonparametric models may suffer from the drawbacks of ""curse of dimensionality"", the varying-coefficient models are a class of structural nonparametric models which are particularly useful in longitudinal analyses. In this article, we present several important nonparametric estimation and inference methods for this class of models, demonstrate the, advantages,, limitations and practical implementations of these methods in different longitudinal settings, and discuss some potential directions of further research in this area. Applications of these methods are illustrated through two epidemiological examples.","bootstrap,confidence bands,hypothesis testing,local polynomials,longitudinal data,smoothing methods,splines,varying coefficient models","KERNEL REGRESSION ESTIMATION,LINEAR-MODELS,SERIAL-CORRELATION,CONFIDENCE BANDS,CLUSTERED DATA,ERRORS,CURVES,PREDICTOR,INFERENCE,SPLINE","Wu, CO@NHLBI, Off Biostat Res, DECA, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA@NICHHD, Div Epidemiol Stat & Prevent Res, Bethesda, MD 20852 USA::Yu, KF@NHLBI, Off Biostat Res, DECA, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA@NICHHD, Div Epidemiol Stat & Prevent Res, Bethesda, MD 20852 USA","Wu, CO@NIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI)@National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA@National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA@NIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)::Yu, KF@NIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI)@National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA@National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA@NIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)",not exist,"STATISTICAL PREDICTOR IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+1970::Simultaneous non-parametric regressions of unbalanced longitudinal data+Besse, PC; Cardot, H; Ferraty, F+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+MAY 12 1997::Inferences for a semiparametric model with panel data+Cheng, SC; Wei, LJ+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 2000::no title+de Boor, C.+A Practical Guide to Splines+1978::no title+Diggle, P.

Graphical diagnostics for modeling unstructured covariance matrice's,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.2307/1403864,DEC 2002,42,5,"Prudent statistical analysis of correlated data requires accounting. for the correlation among the measurements. Specifying a form for the covariance matrix of the data could reduce the high number of parameters of the covariance and increase efficiency of the inferences about the regression parameters. Motivated by the success of ordinary, partial and inverse correlograms in identifying parsimonious models for stationary time series, we introduce generalizations of these plots for nonstationary data. Their roles in detecting heterogeneity and correlation of the data and identifying parsimonious models for the covariance matrix are illuminated using a longitudinal dataset. Decomposition of a covariance matrix into ""variance"" and ""dependence"" components provides the necessary ingredients for the proposed graphs. This amounts to replacing a 3-D correlation plot by a pair of 2-D plots, providing complementary information about dependence and heterogeneity. Models identified and fitted using the variance-correlation decomposition of a covariance matrix are not guaranteed to be positive definite, but those using the modified Cholesky decomposition are. Limitations of our graphical diagnostics for general multivariate data where the measurements are not (time-) ordered are discussed.","Cholesky decomposition,correlogram,inverse correlogram,linear covariance models,partial correlogram,positive-definiteness constraint,regressogram,toeplitz matrix,unconstrained parameterization.","GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,LONGITUDINAL DATA,TIME-SERIES","Pourahmadi, M@No Illinois Univ, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA@Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Pourahmadi, M@Northern Illinois University@University of Chicago",not exist,"ASYMPTOTICALLY EFFICIENT ESTIMATION OF COVARIANCE MATRICES WITH LINEAR STRUCTURE+ANDERSON, TW+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1973::no title+ANDERSON TW+INTRO MULTIVARIATE A+1984::no title+Basford, K.

On choosing and bounding probability metrics,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.2307/1403865,DEC 2002,50,306,"When studying convergence of measures, an. important, issue is the choice of probability metric. We provide a summary and some new results concerning bounds among some important probability metrics/distances that are used by statisticians and probabilists. Knowledge of other metrics can provide a means of deriving bounds for another one in an applied problem. Considering other metrics can also provide alternate insights. We also give examples that show that rates of convergence can strongly depend on the metric chosen. Careful consideration is necessary when choosing a metric.","discrepancy,hellinger distance,probability metrics,prokhorov metric,relative entropy,rates of convergence,wasserstein distance","RANDOM-WALKS,MARKOV-CHAINS,CONVERGENCE","Gibbs, AL@York Univ, Dept Math & Stat, N York, ON M3J 1P3, Canada@Harvey Mudd Coll, Dept Math, Claremont, CA 91711 USA::Su, FE@York Univ, Dept Math & Stat, N York, ON M3J 1P3, Canada@Harvey Mudd Coll, Dept Math, Claremont, CA 91711 USA","Gibbs, AL@York University - Canada@Harvey Mudd College::Su, FE@York University - Canada@Harvey Mudd College",not exist,"STRONG UNIFORM TIMES AND FINITE RANDOM-WALKS+ALDOUS, D; DIACONIS, P+ADVANCES IN APPLIED MATHEMATICS+MAR 1987::no title+Bernardo, JM; Smith, AFM.+Bayesian theory+1994::no title+Borovkov, A.

Bayesian MCMC mapping of quantitative trait loci in a half-sib design: a graphical model perspective,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,AUG 2002,59,3,"Graphical models provide a powerful and flexible approach to the analysis of complex problems in genetics. While task-specific software may be extremely efficient for any particular analysis, it is often difficult to adapt to new computational challenges. By viewing these genetic applications in a more general framework, many problems can be handled by essentially the same software. This is advantageous in an area where fast methodological development is essential. Once a method has been fully developed and tested, problem-specific software may then be required. The aim of this paper is to illustrate the potential use of a graphical model approach to genetic analyses by taking a very simple and well-understood problem by way of example.","pedigree analysis,peeling,conditional distribution,Bayesian networks,graphical models,Markov chain Monte Carlo,mixing,block updating","CHAIN-MONTE-CARLO,LINKAGE ANALYSIS,COMPLEX PEDIGREES,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,INHERITANCE MODEL,EXPERT-SYSTEMS,SINGLE MARKERS,POPULATIONS,METHODOLOGY,INFERENCE","Sheehan, NA@Univ Leicester, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Leicester LE1 6TP, Leics, England@Danish Inst Agr Sci, Dept Anim Breeding & Genet, DK-8820 Tjele, Denmark::Gulbrandtsen, B@Univ Leicester, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Leicester LE1 6TP, Leics, England@Danish Inst Agr Sci, Dept Anim Breeding & Genet, DK-8820 Tjele, Denmark::Lund, MS@Univ Leicester, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Leicester LE1 6TP, Leics, England@Danish Inst Agr Sci, Dept Anim Breeding & Genet, DK-8820 Tjele, Denmark::Sorensen, DA@Univ Leicester, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Leicester LE1 6TP, Leics, England@Danish Inst Agr Sci, Dept Anim Breeding & Genet, DK-8820 Tjele, Denmark","Sheehan, NA@University of Leicester@Aarhus University::Gulbrandtsen, B@University of Leicester@Aarhus University::Lund, MS@University of Leicester@Aarhus University::Sorensen, DA@University of Leicester@Aarhus University",not exist,"Hugin: a shell for building Bayesian belief universes for expert systems+Andersen, S.K.; Olesen, K.G.; Jensen, F.V.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Jensen, F</span>.+P 11 INT JOINT C ART+1989::PROBABILITY FUNCTIONS ON COMPLEX PEDIGREES+CANNINGS, C; THOMPSON, EA; SKOLNICK, MH+ADVANCES IN APPLIED PROBABILITY+1978::EMPIRICAL THRESHOLD VALUES FOR QUANTITATIVE TRAIT MAPPING+CHURCHILL, GA; DOERGE, RW+GENETICS+NOV 1994::Applications of a general propagation algorithm for probabilistic expert systems+Dawid, A.P.+Statistics and Computing+March 1992::GENERAL MODEL FOR GENETIC ANALYSIS OF PEDIGREE DATA+ELSTON, RC; STEWART, J+HUMAN HEREDITY+1971::no title+FALCONER, D.

"Randomized response, statistical disclosure control and misclassification: a review",INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.2307/1403910,AUG 2002,32,37,"This paper discusses analysis of categorical data which have been misclassified and where misclassification probabilities are known. Fields where this kind of misclassification occurs are randonlitized response, statistical disclosure control, and classification with known sensitivity and specificity. Estimates of true frequencies are given, and adjustments to the odds ratio are discussed. Moment estimates and maximum likelihood estimates are compared and it is proved that they are the same in the interior of the parameter space. Since moment estimators are regularly outside the parameter space, special attention is paid to the possibility of boundary solutions. An example is given.","contingency table,EM algorithm,misclassification,odds ratio,randomized response,sensitivity,specificity,statistical disclosure control","CATEGORICAL-DATA,EM ALGORITHM","van den Hout, A@Univ Utrecht, Fac Social Sci, Dept Methodol & Stat, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands::van der Heijden, PGM@Univ Utrecht, Fac Social Sci, Dept Methodol & Stat, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands","van den Hout, A@Utrecht University::van der Heijden, PGM@Utrecht University",not exist,"no title+Agresti, A.+An Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis.+1996::no title+AGRESTI, Alan.+Categorical data analysis+1990::no title+BARNDORFFNIELSE.O+ENCY STAT SCI+1982::no title+Bishop, YM; Fienberg, SE; Holland, PW.+Discrete Multivariate Analysis - Theory and Practice+1975::ESTIMATING PROPORTIONS FROM RANDOMIZED-RESPONSE DATA USING THE EM ALGORITHM+BOURKE, PD; MORAN, MA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1988::no title+Chaudhuri, A.; Mukerjee, R.+Randomized Response : Theory and Techniques+1988::A REVIEW OF METHODS FOR MISCLASSIFIED CATEGORICAL-DATA IN EPIDEMIOLOGY+CHEN, TT+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+SEP 1989::BIAS DUE TO MISCLASSIFICATION IN ESTIMATION OF RELATIVE RISK+COPELAND, KT; CHECKOWAY, H; MCMICHAEL, AJ; et al.+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+1977::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::no title+Efron, B; Tibshirani, R.+An Introduction to the Bootstrap+1993::no title+Fox, J.A.; Tacy, P.E.+Randomized Response : A Method for Sensitive Survey+1986::Post randomisation for statistical disclosure control: theory and implementation+Gouweleeuw, J; Kooiman, P; Willenborg, L.+J Offical Stat+1998::THE EFFECT OF MISCLASSIFICATION IN THE PRESENCE OF COVARIATES+GREENLAND, S+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+1980::VARIANCE-ESTIMATION FOR EPIDEMIOLOGIC EFFECT ESTIMATES UNDER MISCLASSIFICATION+GREENLAND, S+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUL 1988::PRAM: A Method for Disclosure Limitation of Microdata+Kooiman, P.; Willenborg, L.; Gouweleeuw, J.+Research Paper 9705+1997::Categorical data analysis and misclassification+Kuha, J.; Skinner, C.+Survey Measurement and Process Quality+1997::ASKING SENSITIVE QUESTIONS INDIRECTLY+KUK, AYC+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1990::ITERATIVE TECHNIQUE FOR RECTIFICATION OF OBSERVED DISTRIBUTIONS+LUCY, LB+ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL+1974::no title+McLachlan, G.

The effect of using household as a sampling unit,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2002.tb00364.x,AUG 2002,27,10,"The effect of sampling people through households is considered. Results on design effects for two stage surveys are reviewed and applied to give design effects of household samples. The main factors that determine the design effect are, identified for the designs in which one person, or all people, are selected from each selected household. Within household correlation is one factor. We show that the relationships between household size and the mean and variance within households are also important factors. Census and survey data are used to empirically compare the design effects for a range of estimators, variables and designs.","cluster sampling,design effect,generalized regression estimator,household surveys,intra-class correlation,sample design,survey design",,"Clark, RG@Univ Wollongong, Inst Math Modelling & Computat Syst, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia::Steel, DG@Univ Wollongong, Inst Math Modelling & Computat Syst, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia","Clark, RG@University of Wollongong::Steel, DG@University of Wollongong","Clark, Robert@D-3806-2011::Steel, David@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3137-9952::Clark, Robert@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4368-5145","Use of experimental design and population modelling in survey sampling+Brewer, K.R.W.; Foreman, E.K.; Mellor, R.W.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Trewin, D.J</span>.+Bull.

"Adults' statistical literacy: Meanings, components, responsibilities",INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,APR 2002,80,148,"Statistical literacy is a key ability expected of citizens in information-laden societies, and is often touted as an expected outcome of schooling and as a necessary component of adults' numeracy and literacy. Yet, its meaning and building blocks have received little explicit attention. This paper proposes a conceptualization of statistical literacy and describes its key components. Statistical literacy is portrayed as the ability to interpret, critically evaluate, and communicate about statistical information and messages. It is argued that statistically literate behavior is predicated on the joint activation of five interrelated knowledge bases (literacy, statistical, mathematical, context, and critical), together with a cluster of supporting dispositions and enabling beliefs. Educational and research implications are discussed, and responsibilities facing educators, statisticians, and other stakeholders are outlined.","statistics education,numeracy,adult education,educational policy,statistical reasoning","MATHEMATICS,PROBABILITY,NUMBERS","Gal, I@Univ Haifa, IL-31999 Haifa, Israel","Gal, I@University of Haifa",not exist,"no title+*AAAS+BENCHM SCI LITERACY+1995::no title+no author+A national statement on mathematics for Australian schools+1991::no title+Baron,, J.+Thinking and deciding+1988::THE EMPOWERMENT OF SERVICE WORKERS - WHAT, WHY, HOW, AND WHEN+BOWEN, DE; LAWLER, EE+SLOAN MANAGEMENT REVIEW+SPR 1992::no title+BRIGHT GW+REFLECTIONS STAT LEA+1998::no title+Carnevale, A.P.+WORKPLACE BASICS ESS+1990::no title+CLEMEN R+ADULT NUMERACY DEV T+2000::Teaching Statistics+Cobb, G.

Some cracks in the empire of chance (flaws in the foundations of reliability),INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2002.tb00345.x,APR 2002,19,5,"Making quantified statements about the uncertainty associated with the lifelength of an item is one of the most fundamental tasks of reliability assessment. Most practitioners routinely do this using one of the several available statistical techniques. The purpose of this paper is two-fold. The first is to give the user an overview of the key tenets of two of the most commonly used parametric approaches. The second is to point out that these commonly used approaches involve strategies that are either ad hoe, or are in violation of some of the underlying tenets. A method that is devoid of logical flaws can be proposed, but this method is difficult to implement. The user must therefore resign to using that technique against which the fewest objections can be hurled.","relative frequency,subjective probability,parameters,probability models,likelihood principle,maximum likelihood,Bayes law",PROBABILITY,"Singpurwalla, ND@George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA","Singpurwalla, ND@George Washington University","SINGPURWALLA, Nozer Darabsha@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3578-2308","no title+ARJAS E+J NONPARAMETRIC STAT+2002::no title+BASU D+5 S NACL PROB EST+1982::Noninformative priors do not exist: A discussion+Bernardo, J. -M.+J.

Estimating long-term trends in tropospheric ozone levels,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2002.tb00351.x,APR 2002,46,5,"This paper develops Bayesian methodology for estimating long-term trends in the daily maxima of tropospheric ozone. The methods are then applied to study long-term trends in ozone at six monitoring sites in the state of Texas. The methodology controls for the effects of meteorological variables because it is known that variables such as temperature, wind speed and humidity substantially affect the formation of tropospheric ozone. A semiparametric regression model is estimated in which a nonparametric trivariate surface is used to model the relationship between ozone and these meteorological variables because, while it is known that the relationship is a complex nonlinear one, its functional form is unknown. The model also allows for the effects of wind direction and seasonality. The errors are modeled as an autoregression, which is methodologically challenging because the observations are unequally spaced over time. Each function in the model is represented as a linear combination of basis functions located at all of the design points. We also estimate an appropriate data transformation simultaneously with the functions. The functions are estimated nonparametrically by a Bayesian hierarchical model that uses indicator variables to allow a non-zero probability that the coefficient of each basis term is zero. The entire model, including the nonparametric surfaces, data transformation and autoregression for the unequally spaced errors, is estimated using a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling scheme with a computationally efficient transition kernel for generating the indicator variables. The empirical results indicate that key meteorological variables explain most of the variation in daily ozone maxima through a nonlinear interaction and that their effects are consistent across the six sites. However, the estimated trends vary considerably from site to site, even within the same city.","autoregression with unequally spaced data,Bayesian model averaging,Bayesian semiparametric regression,data transformation,nonparametric regression,radial bases,Markov chain Monte Carlo","NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION,VARIABLE SELECTION,ADDITIVE-MODELS,URBAN OZONE,COMPUTATION,EXPOSURE,SPLINES","Smith, M@Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia@Univ New S Wales, Grad Sch Management, Kensington, NSW 2033, Australia@Univ Texas, Dept Management Sci & Informat Syst, Austin, TX 78712 USA::Yau, P@Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia@Univ New S Wales, Grad Sch Management, Kensington, NSW 2033, Australia@Univ Texas, Dept Management Sci & Informat Syst, Austin, TX 78712 USA::Shively, T@Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia@Univ New S Wales, Grad Sch Management, Kensington, NSW 2033, Australia@Univ Texas, Dept Management Sci & Informat Syst, Austin, TX 78712 USA::Kohn, R@Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia@Univ New S Wales, Grad Sch Management, Kensington, NSW 2033, Australia@Univ Texas, Dept Management Sci & Informat Syst, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Smith, M@University of Sydney@University of New South Wales Sydney@University of Texas System@University of Texas Austin::Yau, P@University of Sydney@University of New South Wales Sydney@University of Texas System@University of Texas Austin::Shively, T@University of Sydney@University of New South Wales Sydney@University of Texas System@University of Texas Austin::Kohn, R@University of Sydney@University of New South Wales Sydney@University of Texas System@University of Texas Austin","Smith, Michael@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7589-2037","no title+BENTON J+ECOSYSTEMS ENV+2000::Accounting for meteorological effects in measuring urban ozone levels and trends+Bloomfield, P; Royle, JA; Steinberg, LJ; et al.+ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT+SEP 1996::AN ANALYSIS OF TRANSFORMATIONS REVISITED, REBUTTED+BOX, GEP; COX, DR+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1982::Ozone exposure and population density in Harris County, Texas+Carroll, RJ; Chen, R; George, EI; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1997::Local regression models+Cleveland, W S; Grosse, E; Shyu, W M.+Statistical Models in S+1992::METEOROLOGICALLY ADJUSTED OZONE TRENDS IN URBAN AREAS - A PROBABILISTIC APPROACH+COX, WM; CHU, SH+ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT PART B-URBAN ATMOSPHERE+DEC 1993::Modeling the effects of meteorology on ozone in Houston using cluster analysis and generalized additive models+Davis, JM; Eder, BK; Nychka, D; et al.+ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT+AUG 1998::no title+DAVIS JM+CASE STUDIES ENV STA+1998::no title+DAVIS JM+CASE STUDIES ENV STA+1998::no title+DENISON D+J ROYAL STAT SOC B+1998::no title+Dongarra, J J.+LINPACK Users' guide+1979::no title+FAHRMEIR L+MATH METHODEN WIRTSC+1999::Benchmark priors for Bayesian model averaging+Fernandez, C; Ley, E; Steel, MFJ+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+FEB 2001::MULTIVARIATE ADAPTIVE REGRESSION SPLINES+FRIEDMAN, JH+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+MAR 1991::Statistical surface ozone models: an improved methodology to account for non-linear behaviour+Gardner, MW; Dorling, SR+ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT+2000::Meteorologically adjusted trends in UK daily maximum surface ozone concentrations+Gardner, MW; Dorling, SR+ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT+2000::VARIABLE SELECTION VIA GIBBS SAMPLING+GEORGE, EI; MCCULLOCH, RE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1993::Reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo computation and Bayesian model determination+Green, PJ+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1995::THE COMPUTATION OF GENERALIZED CROSS-VALIDATION FUNCTIONS THROUGH HOUSEHOLDER TRIDIAGONALIZATION WITH APPLICATIONS TO THE FITTING OF INTERACTION SPLINE MODELS+GU, C; BATES, DM; CHEN, Z; et al.+SIAM JOURNAL ON MATRIX ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS+OCT 1989::no title+Hastie,, T.

Small area estimation - New developments and directions,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2002.tb00352.x,APR 2002,50,99,"The purpose of this paper is to provide a critical review of the main advances in small area estimation (SAE) methods in recent years. We also discuss some of the earlier developments, which serve as a necessary background for the new studies. The review focuses on model dependent methods with special emphasis on point prediction of the target area quantities, and mean square error assessments. The new models considered are models used for discrete measurements, time series models and models that arise under informative sampling. The possible gains from modeling the correlations among small area random effects used to represent the unexplained variation of the small area target quantities are examined. For review and appraisal of the earlier methods used for SAE, see Ghosh Rao (1994).","best linear unbiased prediction,cross-sectional correlations,empirical Bayes,hierarchical Bayes,informative sampling,mixed models,time series models","MEAN SQUARED ERROR,STOCHASTIC PARAMETER REGRESSION,STATE-SPACE MODELS,BAYESIAN PREDICTION,LINEAR-MODELS,TIME-SERIES,INFERENCE,INCOME","Pfeffermann, D@Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Stat, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel@Univ Southampton, Dept Social Stat, Southampton SO9 5NH, Hants, England","Pfeffermann, D@Hebrew University of Jerusalem@University of Southampton",not exist,"PREDICTION MEAN SQUARED ERROR FOR STATE-SPACE MODELS WITH ESTIMATED PARAMETERS+ANSLEY, CF; KOHN, R+BIOMETRIKA+AUG 1986::On the superiority of the Bayesian method over the BLUP in small area estimation problems+Arora, V; Lahiri, P+STATISTICA SINICA+OCT 1997::AN ERROR-COMPONENTS MODEL FOR PREDICTION OF COUNTY CROP AREAS USING SURVEY AND SATELLITE DATA+BATTESE, GE; HARTER, RM; FULLER, WA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1988::The time series approach to estimation for repeated surveys+Bell, W.R.; Hillmer, S.C.+Survey Methodology+1990::Modelling and estimation for repeated surveys+Binder, D.A.; Dick, J.P.+Survey Methodology+1989::no title+BOX GEP+TUNE SERIES ANAL FOR+1976::EMPIRICAL BAYES ESTIMATES OF AGE-STANDARDIZED RELATIVE RISKS FOR USE IN DISEASE MAPPING+CLAYTON, D; KALDOR, J+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1987::no title+Cressie,, N.

What makes business statistics special?,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,APR 2002,19,9,"Non-specialists might have the feeling that building statistics on businesses is a very simple task: it seems one just has to ""add facts"". But for survey statisticians, business statistics are extremely complex: great heterogeneity of the universe, definition of the statistical units, difficulty of classifying businesses, quality of the register, variety of accounting standards, sample co-ordination, or reduction of survey burden. This paper argues that the issues raised by business survey methodology are conceptual and not only practical. It describes different aspects of statistical processing and tries to analyse the special features of business statistics.","business surveys,business register,data collection,enterprise,official statistics,sample coordination,statistical units,survey management,survey methodology",,"Riviere, P@Univ Southampton, Dept Social Stat, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England@INSEE, F-75675 Paris 14, France","Riviere, P@University of Southampton@Unknow",not exist,"Managing data quality in a statistical agency+Brackston, G.+Statistics Canada Survey Methodology.+1999::no title+CHRISTIANSON A+BUSINESS SURVEY METH+1995::Frames and Business Registers: an Overview+Colledge, Michael.+Business Survey Methods+1995::no title+COTTON F+P STAT CAN S NOV 92+1992::no title+DILLMAN D+P 2 INT C EST SURV 2+2001::no title+ELDRIDGE J+P 2 INT C EST SURV 2+2001::Statistical services: Preparing for the future+Fellegi, I.+Survey Methodology+1999::no title+LARSEN MD+14 INT ROUND TABL BU+2000::no title+LAWRENCE D+J OFFICIAL STAT+2000::no title+LINACRE S+P 2 INT C EST SURV 2+2001::no title+NICHOLLS W+P 2 INT C EST SURV 2+2001::no title+OHLSSON E+BUSINESS SURVEY METH+1995::no title+PAXSON C+BUSINESS SURVEY METH+1995::no title+PIETSCH L+BUSINESS SURVEY METH+1995::no title+RIVIERE P+ACCOUNTING STANDARDS+1998::no title+RIVIERE P+COURRIER STAT+1998::no title+RIVIERE P+P STAT CAN S MAY 98+1998::no title+ROYCE D+P 2 INT C EST SURV 2+2001::no title+SUDMAN S+P 2 INT C EST SURV 2+2001"
Modeling clustered ordered categorical data: A survey,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.2307/1403450,DEC 2001,132,41,"This article surveys various strategies for modeling ordered categorical (ordinal) response variables when the data have some type of clustering, extending a similar survey for binary data by Pendergast, Gange, Newton, Lindstrom, Palta & Fisher (1996). An important special case is when repeated measurement occurs at various occasions for each subject, such as in longitudinal studies. A much greater variety of models and fitting methods are available than when a similar survey for repeated ordinal response data was prepared a decade ago (Agresti, 1989). The primary emphasis of the review is on two classes of models, marginal models for which effects are averaged over all clusters at particular levels of predictors, and cluster-specific models for which effects apply at the cluster level. We present the two types of models in the ordinal context, review the literature for each, and discuss connections between them. Then, we summarize some alternative modeling approaches and ways of estimating parameters, including a Bayesian approach. We also discuss applications and areas likely to be popular for future research, such as ways of handling missing data and ways of modeling agreement and evaluating the accuracy of diagnostic tests. Finally, we review the current availability of software for using the methods discussed in this article.","Bayesian inference,cumulative logit models,generalized estimating equations,logit models,marginal models,matched pairs,missing data,ordinal data,proportional odds,random effects,repeated measures,square contingency tables","GENERALIZED ESTIMATING EQUATIONS,BAYESIAN HIERARCHICAL MODEL,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD METHODS,SQUARE CONTINGENCY-TABLES,PROPORTIONAL ODDS MODELS,ORDINAL RESPONSE DATA,LOG-LINEAR MODELS,REGRESSION-MODEL,LONGITUDINAL DATA,MARGINAL DISTRIBUTIONS","Agresti, A@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA::Natarajan, R@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Agresti, A@State University System of Florida@University of Florida::Natarajan, R@State University System of Florida@University of Florida",not exist,"QUASI-SYMMETRICAL LATENT CLASS MODELS, WITH APPLICATION TO RATER AGREEMENT+AGRESTI, A;

Modelling overdispersion for complex survey data,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.1111/j.1751-5823.2001.tb00464.x,DEC 2001,21,6,"The population characteristics observed by selecting a complex sample from a finite identified population are the result of at least two processes: the process which generates the values attached to the units in the finite population, and the process of selecting the sample of units from the population. In this paper we propose that the resulting observations be viewed as the joint realization of both processes. We overcome the inherent difficulty in modelling the joint processes of generation and selection by exploring second moment and other simplifying assumptions. We obtain general expressions for the mean and covariance function of the joint processes and show that several overdispersion models discussed in the literature for the analysis of complex surveys are a direct consequence of our formulation, under particular sampling schemes and population structures.","categorical data,inclusion probability,generation process,model-based inference,overdispersion,randomization inference,sampling design,selection,underdispersion",LINEAR-MODELS,"Molina, EA@Univ Simon Bolivar, Dept Matemat Puras & Aplicadas, Caracas, Venezuela@Univ Southampton, Dept Math, Southampton SO9 5NH, Hants, England@Univ London Goldsmiths Coll, Dept Math & Comp Sci, London SE14 6NW, England::Smith, TMF@Univ Simon Bolivar, Dept Matemat Puras & Aplicadas, Caracas, Venezuela@Univ Southampton, Dept Math, Southampton SO9 5NH, Hants, England@Univ London Goldsmiths Coll, Dept Math & Comp Sci, London SE14 6NW, England::Sugden, RA@Univ Simon Bolivar, Dept Matemat Puras & Aplicadas, Caracas, Venezuela@Univ Southampton, Dept Math, Southampton SO9 5NH, Hants, England@Univ London Goldsmiths Coll, Dept Math & Comp Sci, London SE14 6NW, England","Molina, EA@Simon Bolivar University@University of Southampton@University of London@Goldsmiths University London::Smith, TMF@Simon Bolivar University@University of Southampton@University of London@Goldsmiths University London::Sugden, RA@Simon Bolivar University@University of Southampton@University of London@Goldsmiths University London",not exist,"no title+Aitkin, M.D.; Anderson, B; Francis<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Hinde, J</span>.+Statistical Modelling in GLIM+1989::PREDICTION-THEORY FOR FINITE POPULATIONS WHEN MODEL-BASED AND DESIGN-BASED PRINCIPLES ARE COMBINED - WITH AN APPLICATION TO A STUDY OF CHOICE OF TRANSPORTATION MODE ACROSS THE ORESUND STRAITS+CASSEL, CM; SARNDAL, CE; WRETMAN, JH+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+1979::no title+COLLETT D+MODELLING BINARY DAT+1991::no title+Cox, D.

"Uses, abuses and misuses of significance tests in the scientific community: Won't the Bayesian choice be unavoidable?",INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,DEC 2001,143,19,"The current context of the ""significance test controversy"" is first briefly discussed. Then experimental studies about the use of null hypothesis significance tests by scientific researchers and applied statisticians are presented. The misuses of these tests are reconsidered as judgmental adjustments revealing researchers' requirements towards statistical inference. Lastly alternative methods are considered. Consequently we automatically ask ourselves ""won't the Bayesian choice be unavoidable?"".","Bayesian methods,confidence intervals,experimental data analysis,Fisher,significance test controversy,statistical inference","MONITORING CLINICAL-TRIALS,CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS,STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE,NULL-HYPOTHESIS,POWER,PROBABILITY,RESEARCHERS,EQUIVALENCE,PSYCHOLOGY,INFERENCE","Lecoutre, B@Lab Math Raphael Salem, UMR 6085 CNRS, F-76821 Mont St Aignan, France@Univ Rouen, F-76821 Mont St Aignan, France@Univ Rouen, ERIS, Lab Psy Co, UFR Psychol, F-76821 Mont St Aignan, France@LCPE, FRE2173 CNRS, INaLF, F-75014 Paris, France::Lecoutre, MP@Lab Math Raphael Salem, UMR 6085 CNRS, F-76821 Mont St Aignan, France@Univ Rouen, F-76821 Mont St Aignan, France@Univ Rouen, ERIS, Lab Psy Co, UFR Psychol, F-76821 Mont St Aignan, France@LCPE, FRE2173 CNRS, INaLF, F-75014 Paris, France::Poitevineau, J@Lab Math Raphael Salem, UMR 6085 CNRS, F-76821 Mont St Aignan, France@Univ Rouen, F-76821 Mont St Aignan, France@Univ Rouen, ERIS, Lab Psy Co, UFR Psychol, F-76821 Mont St Aignan, France@LCPE, FRE2173 CNRS, INaLF, F-75014 Paris, France","Lecoutre, B@CNRS - National Institute for Mathematical Sciences (INSMI)@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)@Universite Cote d'Azur (ComUE)@Universite de Rouen Normandie@Normandie Universite@Universite de Rouen Normandie@Normandie Universite@Unknow::Lecoutre, MP@CNRS - National Institute for Mathematical Sciences (INSMI)@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)@Universite Cote d'Azur (ComUE)@Universite de Rouen Normandie@Normandie Universite@Universite de Rouen Normandie@Normandie Universite@Unknow::Poitevineau, J@CNRS - National Institute for Mathematical Sciences (INSMI)@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)@Universite Cote d'Azur (ComUE)@Universite de Rouen Normandie@Normandie Universite@Universite de Rouen Normandie@Normandie Universite@Unknow",not exist,"The Probable Error of a Mean+[Anonymous].+Biometrika+1908::TEST OF SIGNIFICANCE IN PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH+BAKAN, D+PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN+1966::REPLICATION REPORT - INTERPRETATION OF LEVELS OF SIGNIFICANCE BY PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCHERS+BEAUCHAMP, KL; MAY, RB+PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORTS+1964::no title+BERGER GO+STAT DECISION THEORY+1985::Some difficulties of interpretation encountered in the application of the chi-square test+Berkson, J+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1938::Bayesian interpretation of frequentist procedures for a Bernoulli process+Bernard, JM+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+FEB 1996::no title+BERNARD JM+NEW WAYS STAT METHOD+2000::no title+Bernardo, JM; Smith, AFM.+Bayesian theory+1994::Experimental design for drug development: a Bayesian approach.+Berry, D A+Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics+1991::A CASE FOR BAYESIANISM IN CLINICAL-TRIALS+BERRY, DA+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+AUG 1993::STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE AND CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS+BERRY, G+MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA+JUN 9 1986::THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES AND SCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESES+BOLLES, RC+PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORTS+1962::MATHEMATICAL VS.

On conformity testing and the use of two stage procedures,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.2307/1403454,DEC 2001,18,10,"Conformity testing is a systematic examination of the extent to which an entity conforms to specified requirements. Such testing is performed in industry as well as in regulatory agencies in a variety of fields. In this paper we discuss conformity testing under measurement or sampling uncertainty. Although the situation has many analogies to statistical testing of a hypothesis concerning the unknown value of the measurand there are no generally accepted rules for handling measurement uncertainty when testing for conformity.

Usually the objective of a test for conformity is to provide assurance of conformity. We therefore suggest that an appropriate statistical test for conformity should be devised such that there is only a small probability of declaring conformity when in fact the entity does not conform. An operational way of formulating this principle is to require that whenever an entity has been declared to be conforming, it should not be possible to alter that declaration, even if the entity was investigated with better (more precise) measuring instruments, or measurement procedures.

Some industries and agencies designate specification limits under consideration of the measurement uncertainty. This practice is not invariant under changes of measurement procedure. We therefore suggest that conformity testing should be based upon a comparison of a confidence interval for the value of the measurand with some limiting values that have been designated without regard to the measurement uncertainty. Such a procedure is in line with the recently established practice of reporting measurement uncertainty as ""an interval of values that could reasonably be attributed to the measurand"".

The price to be paid for a reliable assurance of conformity is a relatively large risk that the procedure will fail to establish conformity for entities that only marginally conform. We suggest a two-stage procedure that may improve this situation and provide a better discriminatory ability. In an example we illustrate the determination of the power function of such a two-stage procedure.","compliance testing,conformity testing,limiting value,specifications,two stage testing,uncertainty of measurement","UNCERTAINTY,EXPOSURE,LIMITS,BLOOD,LEAD","Holst, E@Natl Inst Occupat Hlth, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark@Tech Univ Denmark, Inst Math Modelling, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark@Free Univ Berlin, Inst Stat & Okomometrie, D-14195 Berlin, Germany::Thyregod, P@Natl Inst Occupat Hlth, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark@Tech Univ Denmark, Inst Math Modelling, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark@Free Univ Berlin, Inst Stat & Okomometrie, D-14195 Berlin, Germany::Wilrich, PT@Natl Inst Occupat Hlth, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark@Tech Univ Denmark, Inst Math Modelling, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark@Free Univ Berlin, Inst Stat & Okomometrie, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Holst, E@Unknow@Technical University of Denmark@Free University of Berlin::Thyregod, P@Unknow@Technical University of Denmark@Free University of Berlin::Wilrich, PT@Unknow@Technical University of Denmark@Free University of Berlin",not exist,"PROTOCOL FOR THE DESIGN AND INTERPRETATION OF METHOD EVALUATION IN ATOMIC-ABSORPTION SPECTROMETRIC ANALYSIS - APPLICATION TO THE DETERMINATION OF LEAD AND MANGANESE IN BLOOD+CHRISTENSEN, JM; POULSEN, OM; ANGLOV, T+JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL ATOMIC SPECTROMETRY+MAR 1992::HUMAN EXPOSURE TO TOXIC METALS - FACTORS INFLUENCING INTERPRETATION OF BIOMONITORING RESULTS+CHRISTENSEN, JM+SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT+APR 21 1995::Measurement uncertainty models+Dieck, RH+ISA TRANSACTIONS+1997::Assessing uncertainty in measurement+Gleser, LJ+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+AUG 1998::INTERVALS FOR THE DESCRIPTION OF THE BIOLOGICAL LEVEL OF A TRACE-ELEMENT IN A REFERENCE POPULATION+HOLST, E; CHRISTENSEN, JM+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES D-THE STATISTICIAN+1992::no title+no author+ISO 2859- 1: Sampling procedures for inspection by attributes - Part 1: sampling schemes indexed by acceptance quality (AQL) for lot-by-lot inspection+1999::no title+*ISO+3951 ISO+1989::Geometrical Product Specifications (GPS)-Inspection by measurement of workpieces and measuring instruments+no author+Decision rules for proving conformance or nonconformance with specification+1998::no title+*ISO DIS+105761 ISODIS+2000::no title+*ISO IEC+ISO IEC GUID 2 STAND+1996::Assessment of compliance of analytical results with regulatory or specification limits+King, B+ACCREDITATION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE+JAN-FEB 1999::Traceability and uncertainty in analytical measurements+Kristiansen, J; Christensen, JM+ANNALS OF CLINICAL BIOCHEMISTRY+MAY 1998::Uncertainty of atomic absorption spectrometry: Application to the determination of lead in blood+Kristiansen, J; Christensen, JM; Nielsen, JL+MIKROCHIMICA ACTA+1996::no title+LEIDEL NA+DHEW NIOSH PUBLICATI+1977::A COMPARISON BETWEEN OSHA-COMPLIANCE CRITERIA AND ACTION-LEVEL DECISION CRITERIA+ROCK, JC+AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE ASSOCIATION JOURNAL+1982::QUALITY ASSURANCE OF BIOLOGICAL MONITORING IN VIEW OF RISK MANAGEMENT+SAKURAI, H+INTERNATIONAL ARCHIVES OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH+1993::BAYESIAN NONPARAMETRICS FOR COMPLIANCE TO EXPOSURE STANDARDS+SYMONS, MJ; CHEN, CC; FLYNN, MR+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1993::Confidence limits for proportion of conformance+Wang, CM; Lam, CT+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 1996"

Estimation methods and related systems at statistics Canada,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,DEC 2001,123,1,"This paper provides an overview of research in estimation techniques, their application, and the development of generalized estimation systems at Statistics Canada. In Canada, the demand for more detailed and better quality cross-sectional data related to various socio-economic issues has increased significantly in recent years. Also, there has been increasing interest in longitudinal data to better understand and interpret the relationships among variables, necessitating the implementation of a number of large scale panel surveys by Statistics Canada. The paper briefly discusses estimation for longitudinal data and a weighting approach developed for cross-sectional data from these surveys. For cross-sectional household and business surveys, as well as the census of population, appropriate calibration estimators developed for each situation are briefly discussed. In addition, regression composite estimation, a method developed to improve the quality of cross-sectional estimates from rotating panel surveys such as the Canadian Labour Force Survey, is presented. With regard to more detailed cross-sectional estimates at sub-provincial levels, different approaches to small area estimation developed for various programs are also presented. We summarize the various modules developed for the Generalized Estimation System. Important new developments within the system include two-phase estimation as well as the estimation of variance for a number of imputation procedures. We briefly review the status of current estimation research on selected topics as well as the direction of future research.","complex surveys,estimation,variance estimation,estimation systems","SMALL-AREA ESTIMATION,VARIANCE-ESTIMATION,COMPLEX SURVEYS,IMPUTATION,TESTS","Singh, MP@STAT Canada, Methodol Branch, Ottawa, ON K1A 0T6, Canada::Hidiroglou, MA@STAT Canada, Methodol Branch, Ottawa, ON K1A 0T6, Canada::Gambino, JG@STAT Canada, Methodol Branch, Ottawa, ON K1A 0T6, Canada::Kovacevic, MS@STAT Canada, Methodol Branch, Ottawa, ON K1A 0T6, Canada","Singh, MP@Statistics Canada::Hidiroglou, MA@Statistics Canada::Gambino, JG@Statistics Canada::Kovacevic, MS@Statistics Canada",not exist,"no title+ARMSTRONG JB+SURV METHODOL+1994::PARALLEL-PROCESSING OF SPATIAL STATISTICS+ARMSTRONG, MP; PAVLIK, CE; MARCIANO, R+COMPUTERS &amp; GEOSCIENCES+MAR 1994::no title+BANKIER M+P SECT SURV RES METH+1997::Calibration estimation in the 1991 and 1996 Canadian censuses+Bankier, M.; Houle, A.M.; Luc, M.+P SECT SURV RES METH+1997::Two step generalized least squares estimation in the 1991 Canadian census+Bankier, M.; Rathwell, S.; Majkowski, M.+P WORKSH US AUX INF+1992::no title+BANKIER MD+AM STAT+1986::Linear weighting of sample survey data+Bethlehem, JG; Keller, WJ.+J Off Stat+1987::Estimating some measure of income inequality from survey data: an application of the estimating equation approach+Binder, D.

Sampling and estimation issues for annual and sub-annual Canadian business surveys,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,DEC 2001,27,3,"A typical Business Register (BR) is mainly based on administrative data files provided by organisations that produce them as a by-product of their function. Such files do not necessarily yield a perfect Business Register. A good BR should have the following characteristics: (1) It should reflect the complex structures of businesses with multiple activities, in multiple locations or with multiple legal entities; (2) It should be free of duplication, extraneous or missing units; (3) It should be properly classified in terms of key stratification variables, including size, geography and industry; (4) It should be easily updateable to represent the ""newer"" business picture, and not lag too much behind it. In reality, not all these desirable features are fully satisfied, resulting in a universe that has missing units, inaccurate structures, as well as improper contact information, to name a few defects.

These defects can be compensated by using sampling and estimation procedures. For example, coverage can be improved using multiple frame techniques, and the sample size can be increased to account for misclassification of units and deaths on the register. At the time of estimation, auxiliary information can be used in a variety of ways. It can be used to impute missing variables, to treat outliers, or to create synthetic variables obtained via modelling. Furthermore, time lags between the birth of units and the time that they are included on the register can be accounted for appropriately inflating the design-based estimates.","frame defects,sampling design,frame updating,auxiliary data,weight sharing,data imputation",LARGE UNITS,"Hidiroglou, MA@STAT Canada, Business Survey Methods Div, Ottawa, ON K1A 0T6, Canada::Laniel, N@STAT Canada, Business Survey Methods Div, Ottawa, ON K1A 0T6, Canada","Hidiroglou, MA@Statistics Canada::Laniel, N@Statistics Canada",not exist,"Outlier robust finite population estimation+Chambers, R.+Journal of the American Statistical Association+1986::FRAMES AND BUSINESS REGISTERS - AN OVERVIEW+COLLEDGE, MJ+BUSINESS SURVEY METHODS+1995::no title+CUTHILL I+STAT CANADA BUSINESS+1996::CALIBRATION ESTIMATORS IN SURVEY SAMPLING+DEVILLE, JC; SARNDAL, CE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1992::no title+ERNST LR+SANKHYA C+1980::SIMPLE ESTIMATORS FOR THE MEAN OF SKEWED POPULATIONS+FULLER, WA+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 1991::no title+GHANGURDE PD+P SECT SURV RES METH+1989::no title+GLASSER GJ+INT STAT REV+1962::COMBINATION OF SURVEYS AND REGISTERS - A CALIBRATION APPROACH WITH CATEGORICAL VARIABLES+HELDAL, J; SPJOTVOLL, E+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+AUG 1988::THE CONSTRUCTION OF A SELF-REPRESENTING STRATUM OF LARGE UNITS IN SURVEY DESIGN+HIDIROGLOU, MA+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+FEB 1986::PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH DESIGNING SUBANNUAL BUSINESS SURVEYS+HIDIROGLOU, MA; SRINATH, KP+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+OCT 1993::SOME ESTIMATORS OF A POPULATION TOTAL FROM SIMPLE RANDOM SAMPLES CONTAINING LARGE UNITS+HIDIROGLOU, MA; SRINATH, KP+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1981::no title+HIDIROGLOU MA+P SECT SURV RES METH+1994::Nonnegative Regression Estimation for Survey Data+Huang, E.

An introduction to coding theory and the two-part minimum description length principle,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.2307/1403812,AUG 2001,31,37,"This article provides a tutorial introduction to the so-called two-part minimum description length (MDL) principle proposed by Rissanen. This two-part MDL principle is a powerful methodology for solving many statistical model selection problems. However, it seems that this powerful methodology is only adopted by a small number of statisticians to tackle a small number of problems. One plausible reason for this is that the coding theory results required by the MDL principle are somewhat new to most statisticians, and that there are not many readily accessible articles introducing these results appearing in the statistical literature. The first part of this article is devoted to a discussion of such coding theory results. Then, in the second part of the article, the two-part MDL principle is introduced and explained. In doing so, only those coding theory results that are presented in the first part of the article are used. Finally, the applicability of the two-part MDL principle is demonstrated by applying it to tackle four different statistical problems.","coding theory,minimum description length principle,model selection,stochastic complexity","STOCHASTIC COMPLEXITY,DENSITY-ESTIMATION,DECISION TREES","Lee, TCM@Colorado State Univ, Dept Stat, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Lee, TCM@Colorado State University",not exist,"NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::Model selection using wavelet decomposition and applications+Antoniadis, A; Gijbels, I; Gregoire, G+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1997::no title+CAMERON MA+UNPUB ESTIMATING SPE+1995::no title+CASTILLO, E.; GUTIERREZ, J.

Our tour begins with Schwarz's approximation of Bayesian integrals via Laplace's method. We then introduce the concepts underlying Rissanen's minimum description length principle via a Bayesian scenario with a known prior; this provides the groundwork for understanding his more complex non-Bayesian MDL which employs a ""universal"" encoding of the integers. Rissanen's method of parameter truncation is contrasted with that employed in various versions of Wallace's minimum message length criteria. Rissanen's more recent notion of stochastic complexity is outlined in terms of Bernardo's information-theoretic derivation of the Jeffreys prior.","Bayesian model selection,minimum description length,minimum message length,stochastic complexity,parameter truncation","MINIMUM DESCRIPTION LENGTH,AKAIKES INFORMATION CRITERION,STOCHASTIC COMPLEXITY,KOLMOGOROV COMPLEXITY,AUTOREGRESSIVE MODEL,BAYESIAN-INFERENCE,TARGET RECOGNITION,DENSITY-ESTIMATION,MESSAGE LENGTH,DISTRIBUTIONS","Lanterman, AD@Univ Illinois, Coordinated Sci Lab, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Lanterman, AD@University of Illinois System@University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign",not exist,"BAYESIAN EXTENSION OF THE MINIMUM AIC PROCEDURE OF AUTOREGRESSIVE MODEL FITTING+AKAIKE, H+BIOMETRIKA+1979::Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principle+Akaike, H.+Breakthroughs in statistics+1992::ALGORITHM FOR COMPUTING CAPACITY OF ARBITRARY DISCRETE MEMORYLESS CHANNELS+ARIMOTO, S+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY+1972::POSTERIOR PROBABILITIES FOR CHOOSING A REGRESSION-MODEL+ATKINSON, AC+BIOMETRIKA+1978::Statistical inference, Occam's razor, and statistical mechanics on the space of probability distributions+Balasubramanian, V+NEURAL COMPUTATION+FEB 15 1997::no title+BARROWMAN JA+OXFORD TXB CLIN HEPA+1991::The likelihood principle and MML estimators+Baxter, R.A.+Proceedings ofthe Conference, ISIS '96.

Competitive on-line statistics,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,AUG 2001,70,87,"A radically new approach to statistical modelling, which combines mathematical techniques of Bayesian statistics with the philosophy of the theory of competitive on-line algorithms, has arisen over the last decade in computer science (to a large degree, under the influence of Dawid's prequential statistics). In this approach, which we call ""competitive on-line statistics"", it is not assumed that data are generated by some stochastic mechanism; the bounds derived for the performance of competitive on-line statistical procedures are guaranteed to hold (and not just hold with high probability or on the average). This paper reviews some results in this area; the new material in it includes the proofs for the performance of the Aggregating Algorithm in the problem of linear regression with square loss.","Bayes's rule,competitive on-line algorithms,linear regression,prequential statistics,worst-case analysis","GRADIENT DESCENT,EXPERT ADVICE,BAYES METHODS,LOSS BOUNDS,PREDICTION,INFORMATION,COMPLEXITY,ALGORITHMS,INFERENCE,TRACKING","Vovk, V@Univ London, Dept Comp Sci, Comp Learning Res Ctr, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England","Vovk, V@University of London@Royal Holloway University London",not exist,"Gambling in a rigged casino: The adversarial multi-armed bandit problem+Auer, P; CesaBianchi, N; Freund, Y; et al.+36TH ANNUAL SYMPOSIUM ON FOUNDATIONS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE, PROCEEDINGS+1995::Tracking the best disjunction+Auer, P; Warmuth, MK+MACHINE LEARNING+AUG 1998::no title+AZOURY KS+IN PRESS MACHINE LEA+1999::no title+BARRON AR+IEEE T INFORMATION T+2000::no title+Beckenbach, E.

"A Bayesian model for estimating census undercount, taking emigration data from foreign censuses",INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.2307/1403816,AUG 2001,17,3,"The new method of measuring net undercount in a census of population is a variant of demographic analysis and is founded in the belief that the most reliable counts of people are the counts of births and deaths. It has been applied to the 1991 census of England and Wales (E&W). The method has two distinctive features. The first is that it bases its estimates of numbers of emigrants on figures of persons born here and recorded as residents in the 1990-91 censuses of other countries. The corresponding data on immigrants are taken from our own census. The method does not therefore require the data on migratory flows that are an essential component of conventional demographic analysis. The second feature is the Bayesian approach in which (1) each of 30 uncertain elements in the calculations is given an a priori error distribution and (2) three empirical constraints are imposed on the sex-age profile of percentage net undercount. This, in conjunction with a Monte Carlo process, generates an error distribution for net undercount. These merits of the method are offset by the demerit that the calculations must await results from the censuses of the other countries in which substantial numbers of our emigrants reside.","census of population,demographic analysis,emigration,international migration,overcount,population statistics,post enumeration survey,undercount,under-enumeration","DEMOGRAPHIC-ANALYSIS,POPULATION COVERAGE,ENUMERATION","Redfern, P@Unknow","Redfern, P@Unknow",not exist,"ESTIMATING HETEROGENEITY IN THE PROBABILITIES OF ENUMERATION FOR DUAL-SYSTEM ESTIMATION+ALHO, JM; MULRY, MH; WURDEMAN, K; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1993::no title+*AUSTR BUR STAT+32280 AUSTR BUR STAT+1995::A methodological strategy for a one-number census in the UK+Brown, JJ; Diamond, ID; Chambers, RL; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1999::no title+CHOLDIN H+LOOKING LAST PERCENT+1994::no title+CITRO CF+BICENTENNIAL CENSUS+1985::ESTIMATION OF POPULATION COVERAGE IN THE 1990 UNITED-STATES CENSUS BASED ON DEMOGRAPHIC-ANALYSIS - COMMENT - UNCERTAINTY IN DEMOGRAPHIC-ANALYSIS+CLOGG, CC; HIMES, CL+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1993::no title+HEADY P+1991 CENSUS VALIDATI+1996::THE 1990 POST-ENUMERATION SURVEY - OPERATIONS AND RESULTS+HOGAN, H+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1993::no title+LOWENTHAL T+TEST OUR PROGR CLINT+1999::ACCURACY OF THE 1990 CENSUS AND UNDERCOUNT ADJUSTMENTS+MULRY, MH; SPENCER, BD+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1993::no title+*OFF POP CENS SURV+1991 CENS GEN REP GR+1995::ESTIMATION OF POPULATION COVERAGE IN THE 1990 UNITED-STATES CENSUS BASED ON DEMOGRAPHIC-ANALYSIS - COMMENT+PASSEL, JS+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1993::Estimating bowhead whale population size and rate of increase from the 1993 census+Raftery, AE; Zeh, JE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1998::ESTIMATION OF POPULATION COVERAGE IN THE 1990 UNITED-STATES CENSUS BASED ON DEMOGRAPHIC-ANALYSIS+ROBINSON, JG; AHMED, B; DASGUPTA, P; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1993::no title+SAVAGE IR+P C CENS UND JUL 198+1980::ON A METHOD OF ESTIMATING BIRTH AND DEATH RATES AND THE EXTENT OF REGISTRATION+SEKAR, CC; DEMING, WE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1949::no title+*STAT CAN+91213 STAT CAN+1994"

Future directions for the teaching and learning of Statistics at the tertiary level,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,NO DOI,APR 2001,15,5,"Significant advances in, and the resultant impact of, Information Technology (IT) during the last fifteen years has resulted in a much more data based society, a trend that can be expected to continue into the foreseeable future. This phenomenon has had a real impact on the Statistics discipline and will continue to result in changes in both content and course delivery. Major research directions have also evolved during the last ten years directly as a result of advances in IT. The impact of these advances has started to flow into course content, at least for advanced courses. One question which arises relates to what impact will this have on the future training of statisticians, both with respect to course content and mode of delivery. At the tertiary level the last 40 years has seen significant advances in theoretical aspects of the Statistics discipline, Universities have been outstanding at producing scholars with a strong theoretical background but questions have been asked as to whether this has, to some degree, been at the expense of appropriate training of the users of statistics (the 'tradespersons').

Future directions in the teaching and learning of Statistics must take into account the impact of IT together with the competing need to produce scholars as well as competent users of statistics to meet the future needs of the market place. For Statistics to survive as a recognizable discipline the need to be able to train statisticians with an ability to communicate is also seen as an area of crucial importance.

Satisfying the needs of society as well as meeting the needs of the profession are considered as the basic determinants which will derive the future teaching and training of statisticians at the tertiary level and will form the basis of this presentation.","impact of Information Technology,Statistics training,professional accreditation,communication skills",PROFESSION,"Nicholls, DF@Australian Natl Univ, Dept Stat & Econometr, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia","Nicholls, DF@Australian National University",not exist,"WHAT IS STATISTICS+BARTHOLOMEW, DJ+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1995::no title+COX DR+ISI REV+1997::no title+FRIEDMAN J+29 S INT HOUST TEX+1997::Nonmathematical statistics: A new direction for the undergraduate discipline+Higgins, JJ+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+FEB 1999::Let's use CQI in our statistics programs+Hogg, RV+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+FEB 1999::STATISTICS AS A PROFESSION+HUNTER, JS+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1994::no title+IMAN RL+AMSTAT NEWS+1994::NEW PARADIGMS FOR THE STATISTICS PROFESSION+IMAN, RL+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1995::no title+KETTENRING J+AMSTAT NEWS+1997::no title+KETTENRING JR+AMSTAT NEWS+1997::Shaping statistics for success in the 21st Century+Kettenring, JR+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1997::no title+MOORE DS+AUSTR NZ J STAT+1999::New pedagogy and new content: The case of statistics+Moore, DS+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+AUG 1997::no title+NICHOLLS D+AUSTR NZ J STAT+1999::Mad cows and ecstasy: Chance and choice in an evidence-based society+Smith, AFM+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1996"

A guide to exact simulation,INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW,10.2307/1403528,APR 2001,41,18,"Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are used to sample from complicated multivariate distributions with normalizing constants that may not be computable in practice and from which direct sampling is not feasible. A fundamental problem is to determine convergence of the chains. Propp & Wilson (1996) devised a Markov chain algorithm called Coupling From The Past (CFTP) that solves this problem, as it produces exact samples from the target distribution and determines automatically how long it needs to run. Exact sampling by CFTP and other methods is currently a thriving research topic, This paper gives a review of some of these ideas,with emphasis on the CFTP algorithm. The concepts of coupling and monotone CFTP are introduced, and results on the running time of the algorithm presented. The interruptible method of Fill (1998) and the method of Murdoch & Green (1998) for exact sampling for continuous distributions are presented. Novel simulation experiments are reported for exact sampling from the Ising model in the setting of Bayesian image restoration, and the results are compared to standard MCMC, The results show that CFTP works at least as well as standard MCMC, with convergence monitored by the method of Raftery & Lewis (1992, 1996).","coupling from the past,efficient sampling,exact simulation,Fill's algorithm,forward coupling,Ising model,MCMC","PERFECT SIMULATION,MARKOV-CHAINS,POINT-PROCESSES,DISTRIBUTIONS,CONVERGENCE,ALGORITHM,SAMPLE,PAST","Dimakos, XK@Univ Oslo, Dept Math, N-0316 Oslo, Norway","Dimakos, XK@University of Oslo",not exist,"Stationary detection in the initial transient problem+Asmussen, S.; Glynn, P.W.; Thorisson, H.+ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation+April 1992::no title+BEST NG+CODA MANUAL VERSION+1995::no title+BROOKS SP+STAT COMPUT+1999::no title+CORCORAN JN+PERFECT SAMPLING IND+1998::Markov chain Monte Carlo convergence diagnostics: A comparative review+Cowles, MK; Carlin, BP+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1996::Expose de la Theorie des Chaines simples constants de Markoff a un nombre fini d'Etats+Doeblin, W.+Revue Math. de l'Union Interbalkanique+1938::An interruptible algorithm for perfect sampling via Markov chains+Fill, JA+ANNALS OF APPLIED PROBABILITY+FEB 1998::no title+FILL JA+EXTENSION FILLS PERF+1999::no title+FISMEN M+698 NORW U TECH+1998::no title+FRIGESSI A+J STAT PHYS+1993::STOCHASTIC RELAXATION, GIBBS DISTRIBUTIONS, AND THE BAYESIAN RESTORATION OF IMAGES+GEMAN, S; GEMAN, D+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE+1984::no title+GREEN PJ+BAYESIAN STAT+1999::Characterization results and Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms including exact simulation for some spatial point processes+Haggstrom, O; Van Lieshout, MCNM; Moller, J+BERNOULLI+AUG 1999::On exact simulation of Markov random fields using coupling from the past+Haggstrom, O; Nelander, K+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+SEP 1999::MONTE-CARLO SAMPLING METHODS USING MARKOV CHAINS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS+HASTINGS, WK+BIOMETRIKA+1970::Studying convergence of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms using coupled sample paths+Johnson, VE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1996::Perfect simulation for the area-interaction point process+Kendall, W.
