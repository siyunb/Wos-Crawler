Effect of the Amount of Phase I Data on the Phase II Performance of S-2 and S Control Charts,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2015,28,12,"Studies on the effect of parameter estimation on control-chart performance have mostly focused on the marginal (unconditional) run length (RL) distribution and some associated characteristics. However, once process parameters are estimated from an in-control (IC) reference sample, the RL follows its conditional distribution given the parameter estimates. With this in mind, our focus is the conditional RL distribution of the S and S-2 charts. First, we concentrate on the IC conditional RL distribution, which is geometric with parameter (probability of success) alpha(TRUE), the unknown attained false-alarm probability, given the estimate of the process standard deviation. We obtain and examine the distribution of alpha(TRUE) as a function of the number and the size of the reference samples. We consider a one-sided prediction interval for alpha(TRUE) and, for several sample sizes, obtain the minimum number of reference sample observations that guarantees, with a specified probability, that alpha(TRUE) will not exceed the nominal value of the false-alarm probability, alpha(NOM), by more than a prespecified percentage. Next, we argue that (and demonstrate why), in the particular case of S and S-2 charts, there is no practical need of a similar analysis of the effects of parameter estimation on their out-of-control performance, and draw some conclusions in terms of guidance for the user.","Average Run Length,Conditional and Unconditional Performance,Control Chart Performance,False-Alarm Rate,Parameter Estimation,Prediction,Reference Sample Size,Run Length,Variability","X-CONTROL CHARTS,STANDARD-DEVIATION,ESTIMATED LIMITS,RUN-LENGTH,PARAMETERS,DESIGN","Epprecht, Eugenio K.@Pontificia Univ Catolica Rio de Janeiro, Dept Ind Engn, BR-22451900 Rio de Janeiro, Brazil::Loureiro, Lorena D.@Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz FIOCRUZ, Biomanguinhos, BR-21040360 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil@Pontificia Univ Catolica Rio de Janeiro, Dept Ind Engn, BR-22451900 Rio de Janeiro, Brazil::Chakraborti, S.@Univ Alabama, Dept Informat Syst Stat & Management Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA","Epprecht, Eugenio K.@Unknow::Loureiro, Lorena D.@Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz::Chakraborti, S.@University of Alabama Tuscaloosa@University of Alabama System",not exist,"Estimation in Shewhart control charts: effects and corrections+Albers, W; Kallenberg, WCM+METRIKA+JUN 2004::Are estimated control charts in control?+Albers, W; Kallenberg, WCM+STATISTICS+FEB 2004::The rate of false signals in X control charts with estimated limits+Bischak, Diane P.; Trietsch, Dan+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2007::The Exact Run Length Distribution and Design of the S&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;Chart When the In-Control Variance Is Estimated+Castagliola, P.; Celano, G; Chen, G.+International Journal of Reliability, Quality and Safety Engineering+2009::A CUSUM control chart for monitoring the variance when parameters are estimated+Castagliola, Philippe; Maravelakis, Petros E.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+APR 2011::Run length, average run length and false alarm rate of Shewhart X-bar chart: Exact derivations by conditioning+Chakraborti, S+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+2000::Run Length, Average Run Length and False Alarm Rate of Shewhart X-bar Chart: Exact Derivations by Conditioning+CHAKRABORTI, S.+Journal of Applied Statistics+2000::Phase I Statistical Process Control Charts: An Overview and Some Results+Chakraborti, S.; Human, S.

Staggered-Level Designs for Response Surface Modeling,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2015,26,4,"In industrial experiments, there are often restrictions in randomization caused by equipment and resource constraints, as well as budget and time constraints. Next to the split-plot and the split-split-plot design, the staggered-level design is an interesting design option for experiments involving two hard-to-change factors. The staggered-level design allows both hard-to-change factors to be reset at different points in time, resulting in a typical staggering pattern of factor-level resettings. It has been shown that, for two-level designs, this staggering pattern leads to statistical benefits in comparison to the split-plot and the split-split-plot design. In this paper, we investigate whether the benefits of the staggered-level design carry over to situations where the objective is to optimize a response and where a second-order response surface model is in place. To this end, we study several examples of D- and I-optimal staggered-level response surface designs.","Cost,D- and I-Optimality Criterion,Response Surface Model,Split-Plot Design,Split-Split-Plot Design,Staggered-Level Design","SPLIT-PLOT DESIGNS,EQUIVALENT-ESTIMATION,CONSTRUCTION,ALGORITHM","Arnouts, Heidi@Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, Res Fund Flanders FWO, Antwerp, Belgium@Univ Antwerp, StatUa Ctr Stat, Antwerp, Belgium::Goos, Peter@Univ Antwerp, StatUa Ctr Stat, Antwerp, Belgium@Univ Leuven, Fac Biosci Engn, Leuven, Belgium@Univ Leuven, Leuven Stat Res Ctr LStat, Leuven, Belgium@Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, Antwerp, Belgium","Arnouts, Heidi@University of Antwerp::Goos, Peter@KU Leuven@University of Antwerp",not exist,"Staggered-Level Designs for Experiments With More Than One Hard-to-Change Factor+Arnouts, Heidi; Goos, Peter+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 2012::Minimum-aberration two-level fractional factorial split-plot designs+Bingham, D; Sitter, RR+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1999::Designing fractional factorial split-plot experiments with few whole-plot factors+Bingham, DR; Schoen, ED; Sitter, RR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2004::Outperforming completely randomized designs+Goos, P; Vandebroek, M+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2004::Optimal split-plot designs+Goos, P; Vandebroek, M+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 2001::D-optimal split-plot designs with given numbers and sizes of whole plots+Goos, P; Vandebroek, M+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 2003::A NEW APPROACH TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF OPTIMAL DESIGNS+HARDIN, RH; SLOANE, NJA+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+DEC 1993::no title+HINKELMANN K+WILEY SER PROBAB ST+2008::Minimum-aberration two-level split-plot designs+Huang, P; Chen, DC; Voelkel, JO+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1998::D-optimal design of split-split-plot experiments+Jones, Bradley; Goos, Peter+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 2009::An Algorithm for Finding D-Efficient Equivalent-Estimation Second-Order Split-Plot Designs+Jones, Bradley; Goos, Peter+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 2012::I-Optimal Versus D-Optimal Split-Plot Response Surface Designs+Jones, Bradley; Goos, Peter+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 2012::A candidate-set-free algorithm for generating D-optimal split-plot designs+Jones, Bradley; Goos, Peter+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2007::The use of Plackett-Burman designs to construct split-plot designs+Kulahci, M; Bisgaard, S+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 2005::D-Optimal and D-Efficient Equivalent-Estimation Second-Order Split-Plot Designs+Macharia, Harrison; Goos, Peter+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 2010::Three-level equivalent-estimation split-plot designs based on subset and supplementary difference set designs+Mylona, Kalliopi; Macharia, Harrison; Goos, Peter+IIE TRANSACTIONS+NOV 1 2013::Optimal Design of Blocked and Split-Plot Experiments for Fixed Effects and Variance Component Estimation+Mylona, Kalliopi; Goos, Peter; Jones, Bradley+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 2014::Searching for D-Efficient Equivalent-Estimation Second-Order Split-Plot Designs+Nam-Ky Nguyen; Tung-Dinh Pham+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2015::Classes of split-plot response surface designs for equivalent estimation+Parker, PA; Kowalski, SA; Vining, GG+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+APR 2006::Unbalanced and minimal point equivalent estimation second-order split-plot designs+Parker, Peter A.; Kowalski, Scott M.; Vining, G.

Control Charts for Simultaneous Monitoring of Parameters of a Shifted Exponential Distribution,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2015,20,12,"Since their introduction in the 1920s, control charts have played a key role in process monitoring and control in a variety of areas, from manufacturing to healthcare. Many of these charts are designed to monitor a single process parameter, such as the mean or the variance, of a normally distributed process, although recently, a number of charts have been developed for jointly monitoring the mean and variance. In practice, however, there are processes that follow multi-parameter nonnormal distributions, but the joint monitoring of parameters of nonnormal distributions remains largely unaddressed in the literature. This paper proposes several control charts and monitoring schemes for the origin and the scale parameters of a process that follows the two-parameter (or the shifted) exponential distribution. This distribution arises in various applications in practice, particularly with time to an event data, such as in reliability studies, and has been studied extensively in the statistical testing and estimation literature. Exact derivations and computer simulations are used to study performance properties of the proposed charts. An illustrative example is provided along with a summary and some conclusions.","Average Run Length (ARL),In Control (IC),Joint Monitoring,Maximum Likelihood,Origin and Scale,Out of Control (OOC),Probability Integral Transform","RELIABILITY,CONSTRUCTION,VARIANCE","Mukherjee, A.@XLRI Xavier Sch Management, Prod Operat & Decis Sci Area, Jamshedpur 831001, Bihar, India::McCracken, A.

Using ANOM Slicing for Multi-Way Models with Significant Interaction,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2015,3,0,"Multi-way (multifactor) models with significant interaction can be analyzed using simple effect comparisons. These F-tests are multiple comparisons, which are referred to as slice tests (e.g., in a two-factor study one slices by factor A by comparing the levels of factor B for each level of A). Slicing uses the full model degrees of freedom and mean squared error (MSE). This paper shows how to use analysis of means (ANOM) methods analogous to ANOVA F-test slicing to perform multiple comparisons. This approach results in a set of powerful decision charts that can be used to assess both statistical and practical significance.","Analysis of Means,Decision Charts,Factorial Designs,Slice Tests",,"Wludyka, Peter@Univ N Florida, Dept Math & Stat, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA","Wludyka, Peter@University of North Florida@State University System of Florida",not exist,"Numerical Evaluations of Multivariate Normal Integrals with Correlations pij = &amp;alpha;&lt;INF&gt;i&lt;/INF&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;INF&gt;j&lt;/INF&gt;+NELSON, P.

On Algorithms for Obtaining Orthogonal and Near-Orthogonal Arrays for Main-Effects Screening,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2015,18,0,"Screening designs for identifying active main effects among a group of factors are frequently used by experimenters. Methods for efficiently designing experiments that estimate main effects are needed, particularly if the experiment involves categorical factors at more than two levels and requires a nonstandard run size. We propose a new and powerful algorithm based on a sequential element-wise-column-wise strategy that focuses on maintaining balance within and between columns. We compare the new algorithm with a column-wise algorithm for finding some selected orthogonal and near-orthogonal arrays. We examine the performance of both algorithms using different criteria and provide a discussion of general strategies in searching for designs.","Column-Wise,Near-Orthogonality Criteria,Sequential Element-Wise,Two-Level, Multi-Level, and Mixed-Level Orthogonal Designs","SUPERSATURATED DESIGNS,MIXED LEVELS,FACTORIAL-DESIGNS,SMALL RUNS,CONSTRUCTION,ABERRATION,SELECTION,LEVEL","Lekivetz, R.@JMP Div SAS, Cary, NC 27513 USA::Sitter, R.@Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada::Bingham, D.@Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada::Hamada, M.

Cluster-Based Profile Analysis in Phase I,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2015,35,2,"Our proposed technique, referred to as cluster-based profile monitoring, incorporates a cluster-analysis phase to aid in determining the possible existence of profiles in the historical data set resulting from an out-of-control process. The proposed method first replaces the data from each sampled unit with an estimated profile, using some appropriate regression method, and clusters the profiles based on their estimated parameter vectors. This yields an initial main cluster, which contains at least half the profiles. The initial estimated parameters for the population average (PA) profile are obtained by fitting a linear mixed model to those profiles in the main cluster. Profiles that are not contained in the initial main cluster may be iteratively added to the main cluster and the mixed model used to update the estimated parameters for the PA profile. Those profiles contained in the final main cluster are considered as resulting from the in-control process while those not included are considered as resulting from an out-of-control process. A simulated example, a Monte Carlo study, and an application demonstrate the performance advantages of this proposed method over a non-cluster based method with respect to more accurate estimates of the PA parameters and improved classification performance criteria.

When the profiles can be represented by m p x 1. vectors, the profile monitoring process is equivalent to the detection of multivariate outliers. For this reason, we also compare our proposed method to a popular method used to identify outliers when dealing with a multivariate response. Our study demonstrates that, when the out-of-control process corresponds to a sustained shift, the cluster-based method using the successive difference estimator is clearly the superior method, among those methods we considered, based on all performance criteria.","Control Chart,Mixed Models,Outliers,Profile Monitoring,Robust,Statistical Process Control","MULTIVARIATE CONTROL CHARTS,INDIVIDUAL OBSERVATIONS,LINEAR PROFILES,QUALITY PROFILES,MIXED MODELS,REGRESSION,PRODUCT","Chen, Yajuan@Pfizer, Andover, MA 01810 USA::Birch, Jeffrey B.@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Stat, Grad Programs, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Woodall, William H.@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Chen, Yajuan@Pfizer::Birch, Jeffrey B.@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Woodall, William H.@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University",not exist,"A Semiparametric Mixed Model Approach to Phase I Profile Monitoring+Abdel-Salam, Abdel-Salam G.; Birch, Jeffrey B.; Jensen, Willis A.+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+JUN 2013::A Case Study on Monitoring Polynomial Profiles in the Automotive Industry+Amiri, Amirhossein; Jensen, Willis A.; Kazemzadeh, Reza Baradaran+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+JUL 2010::A Phase I Cluster-Based Method for Analyzing Nonparametric Profiles+CHEN, Y.; BIRCH, J.

Residuals-Based CUSUM Charts for Poisson INAR(1) Processes,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2015,19,2,"To monitor count-type observations that are correlated over time, the Poisson INAR(1) CUSUM chart has been proposed for cases where an integer-valued autoregressive process of order 1 with a Poisson marginal is appropriate. In a recent study, it is shown that the Poisson INAR(1) CUSUM control chart is especially well suited to detection problems that involve mean shifts in a process. Although special causes of variation that result in mean shifts are the most common out-of-control situations in practice, some special causes of variation may also result in shifts of the autocorrelation coefficient or the process variance. In this research, we define three types of residuals from the time-series model and develop corresponding approaches for CUSUM monitoring. In particular, three CUSUM control charts, one for each of these residuals, as well as a multivariate CUSUM monitoring of the residuals are investigated. A Phase II comparison of these residuals' monitoring approaches together with a benchmark CUSUM of the count type observations indicate that, for different types of process shifts, different residual monitoring approaches may perform better.","Attributes Control Chart,Poisson Distribution,Autocorrelation,INAR(1) Model,Overdispersion,CUSUM Charts","TIME-SERIES,MODELS,AUTOREGRESSION,COUNTS","Weiss, Christian H.@Helmut Schmidt Univ, Dept Math & Stat, D-22008 Hamburg, Germany::Testik, Murat Caner@Hacettepe Univ, Dept Ind Engn, TR-06800 Beytepe, Turkey","Weiss, Christian H.@Unknow::Testik, Murat Caner@Hacettepe University","TESTIK, MURAT@G-6133-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2389-4759","First-Order Integer-Valued Autoregressive Process: Distributional and Regression Properties+ALZAID, A.

Identification of Dispersion Effects from Partially Replicated Two-Level Factorial Designs,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2015,20,0,"Variation reduction in industrial quality improvement is always a primary objective to reach. Thus, well-designed experiments are needed to identify both location and dispersion effects to control the quality characteristic of interest around a target value with a minimal variation. Analysis of dispersion effects typically requires duplicates on treatment combinations. This can lead to a costly experiment due to a large number of experimental runs. An unreplicated design with relatively fewer runs seems to be an attractive alternative for users. However, the use of an unreplicated design can be inherently difficult in the identification of the truly active effects because location and dispersion effects are possibly confounded. In this article, we promote a class of regular two-level factorial designs with partial replications, which could be considered as compromise designs in terms of cost and efficiency. Also, based on the concepts of generalized p-values, we develop a statistical testing procedure to identify significant dispersion effects from the partially replicated designs. In addition, a catalogue of such designs with practical run sizes is provided for applications.","Fractional Factorial Design,Generalized p-Value,Minimum Aberration Criterion,Quality Improvement,Screening Experiment","LOCATION,VALUES","Tsai, Shin-Fu@Feng Chia Univ, Dept Stat, Taichung 40724, Taiwan::Liao, Chen-Tuo@Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Agron, Div Biometry, Taipei 10617, Taiwan::Chai, Feng-Shun@Acad Sinica, Inst Stat Sci, Taipei 11529, Taiwan","Tsai, Shin-Fu@Feng Chia University::Liao, Chen-Tuo@National Taiwan University@Agricultural Research Institute of Taiwan::Chai, Feng-Shun@Academia Sinica - Taiwan",not exist,"Dispersion effects from unreplicated designs in the 2(k-p) series+Bergman, B; Hynen, A+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 1997::DISPERSION EFFECTS FROM FRACTIONAL DESIGNS+BOX, GEP; MEYER, RD+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1986::Methods for identifying dispersion effects in unreplicated factorial experiments: A critical analysis and proposed strategies+Brenneman, WA; Nair, VN+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 2001::A CATALOG OF 2-LEVEL AND 3-LEVEL FRACTIONAL FACTORIAL-DESIGNS WITH SMALL RUNS+CHEN, JH; SUN, DX; WU, CFJ+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+APR 1993::DIAGNOSTICS FOR HETEROSCEDASTICITY IN REGRESSION+COOK, RD; WEISBERG, S+BIOMETRIKA+1983::VARIANCE FUNCTION ESTIMATION+DAVIDIAN, M; CARROLL, RJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1987::QUICK AND EASY ANALYSIS OF UNREPLICATED FACTORIALS+LENTH, RV+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1989::Identification of dispersion effects from unreplicated 2(n-k) fractional factorial designs+Liao, CT+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+MAY 28 2000::Confounding of location and dispersion effects in unreplicated fractional factorials+McGrath, RN; Lin, DKJ+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 2001::Testing multiple dispersion effects in unreplicated fractional factorial designs+McGrath, RN; Lin, DKJ+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 2001::ANALYZING DISPERSION EFFECTS FROM REPLICATED FACTORIAL-EXPERIMENTS+NAIR, VN; PREGIBON, D+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 1988::Generalized Linear Models for the Analysis of Taguchi Type Experiments+Nelder, J.A.; Lee, Y.+Applied Stochastic Models and Data Analysis+1991::The impact of unidentified location effects on dispersion-effects identification from unreplicated factorial designs+Pan, GH+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1999::AN APPROXIMATE DISTRIBUTION OF ESTIMATES OF VARIANCE COMPONENTS+SATTERTHWAITE, FE+BIOMETRICS BULLETIN+1946::Variation Reduction by the Use of Designed Experiments+SIRVANCI, M.

Searching for D-Efficient Equivalent-Estimation Second-Order Split-Plot Designs,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2015,23,2,"Several industrial experiments are set up using second-order split-plot designs (SPDs). These experiments have two types of factors: whole-plot (WP) factors and subplot (SP) factors. WP factors, also called hard-to-change factors, are factors for which levels are hard or expensive to change. SP factors, also called easy-to-change factors, are factors for which levels are easy or less expensive to change. In a split-plot experiment, the WP factors are confounded with blocks. Certain SPDs possess the equivalent-estimation property. For SPDs with this property, ordinary least-squares estimates of the model parameters are equivalent to the generalized least-squares estimates.

This paper describes a fast and simple algorithm that produces D-efficient equivalent-estimation SPDs by interchanging the levels of the SP factors within each WP. The performance of this algorithm is evaluated against the 111 SPD scenarios reported in Macharia and Coos (2010) and Jones and Coos (2012).","Box-Behnken Designs,Central-Composite Designs,D-Optimality,Interchange Algorithm,Response Surface Model","RESPONSE-SURFACE DESIGNS,ALGORITHM","Nam-Ky Nguyen@VIASM, Hanoi, Vietnam@VNU Int Sch, Hanoi, Vietnam::Tung-Dinh Pham@VNU Univ Sci, Hanoi, Vietnam",Nam-Ky Nguyen@Unknow::Tung-Dinh Pham@Unknow,not exist,"Update formulas for split-plot and block designs+Arnouts, Heidi; Goos, Peter+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+DEC 1 2010::Some new three level designs for the study of quantitative variables+Box, G.

A Robust Estimator for Location in Phase I Based on an EWMA Chart,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2014,26,5,"In practice, a control chart for process monitoring (Phase II) is based on parameters estimated from data collected on the process characteristic under study (Phase l). The Phase I data could contain unacceptable data, which in turn could affect the monitoring. In this study, we consider various estimation methods that are potentially relevant within the parameter estimation process. The quality of the Phase I study is evaluated in terms of the precision of the resulting estimates as well as the effectiveness of the exploratory data analysis, where 'effectiveness' is measured by the proportion of observations that are correctly identified as unacceptable. Moreover, we study the impact of the Phase I estimation method on the performance of the EWMA control chart in Phase II.","Changepoint,Control Chart,Estimation,Monitoring,Outliers,Statistical Process Control","WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE,ESTIMATED PARAMETERS,STANDARD-DEVIATION,DESIGN,(X)OVER-BAR,SCHEMES","Zwetsloot, Inez M.@Univ Amsterdam, NL-1018 TV Amsterdam, Netherlands::Schoonhoven, Marit@Univ Amsterdam, NL-1018 TV Amsterdam, Netherlands::Does, Ronald J.

CUSUM Charts for Monitoring the Characteristic Life of Censored Weibull Lifetimes,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2014,17,13,"Companies routinely perform life tests on their products. Each of these life tests typically involves testing several units simultaneously with interest in the times to failure. Two aspects often associated with lifetime data that make the development of a control-charting procedure more demanding are that the data tend to be nonnormally distributed and censored. In this paper, one-sided lower and upper likelihood-ratio-based cumulative sum (CUSUM) control charting procedures are developed for Type I right-censored Weibull lifetime data to monitor changes in the scale parameter, also known as the characteristic life, for a fixed value of the Weibull shape parameter. Because a decrease in the characteristic life indicates a decrease in the mean lifetime of a product, a one-sided lower CUSUM chart is the main focus. We illustrate the development and implementation of the chart and evaluate its properties through a simulation study. The proposed CUSUM chart is compared with an exponentially weighted moving-average (EWMA) chart using the steady-state average run length (ARL) performance. The CUSUM chart is shown to perform better than the EWMA chart in detecting shifts for which it is designed.","Censoring,EWMA Chart,Exponential Distribution,Lifetime Monitoring,Reliability,Steady-State ARL,Weibull Distribution","MEDIAN-RANK REGRESSION,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,PARAMETER,EWMA","Dickinson, Rebecca M.@Virginia Tech, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Roberts, Denisa A.

Fractional Brownian Fields for Response Surface Metamodeling,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2014,31,3,"Kriging, a widely used metamodeling method for computer-simulation data, models the response surface as a realization of a random field. Stationary covariance functions such as the Gaussian, power exponential, or Matern class are the most common choice for the underlying random field model. Nonstationary versions of these same covariance functions with scale parameters that vary spatially are also sometimes used. Fractional Brownian fields (FBFs) are a different form of nonstationary random field model having stationary increments, an example of more general intrinsic stationary processes. Although FBFs have been considered for intrinsic kriging in the spatial statistics literature, they have received little attention for computer-simulation response surface metamodeling. For use in the latter context, we argue that they have some attractive (as well as some unattractive) properties that mitigate certain problems inherent to many stationary covariance models, such as reversion to the mean, numerical issues due to near-singularity of covariance matrices, and difficulties in handling abrupt response surface features.","Computer Experiments,Gaussian Random Fields,Interpolation,Intrinsic Stationary,Kriging,Prediction Intervals","GAUSSIAN PROCESS MODELS,COMPUTER EXPERIMENTS,COVARIANCE FUNCTIONS,DESIGN","Zhang, Ning@Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA::Apley, Daniel W.@Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA","Zhang, Ning@Northwestern University::Apley, Daniel W.@Northwestern University","Apley, Daniel@B-7454-2009","COMPOSITE GAUSSIAN PROCESS MODELS FOR EMULATING EXPENSIVE FUNCTIONS+Ba, Shan; Joseph, V.

Parametric Yield Modeling Using Hidden Variable Logistic Regression,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2014,19,3,"Yield modeling is a critical subject in the semiconductor industry and has undergone extensive research. We propose a parametric yield modeling method using a novel technique, namely a hidden variable logistic (HVL) regression. Working with process data, HVL regression can be used to provide an accurate target value and specification limits, which are primary concerns in semiconductor manufacturing, for a particular process variable in a manufacturing step. When defining a success as a status that the semiconductor functions correctly, we can simultaneously estimate the probability of success for the particular process variable and that of success for the process variables other than the particular variable using HVL regression. The proposed parametric yield modeling is used effectively to identify the critical process variables and deal with missing observations. We demonstrate that HVL regression outperforms logistic regression in terms of integrated mean-squared error (IMSE) through Monte Carlo simulation-based investigations.","Critical Process Variable,Hidden Variable,Logistic Regression,Parametric Yield,Semiconductor Circuit,Yield Model","TOOL DATA,SEMICONDUCTOR","Hwang, Jung Yoon@Samsung Elect, Dept Syst Engn, Hwasung Si 445701, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea::Lee, Hyun Cheol@Korea Aerosp Univ, Dept Business Adm, Goyang Si 412791, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea","Hwang, Jung Yoon@Samsung::Lee, Hyun Cheol@Korea Aerospace University",not exist,"Latent variable regression for multiple discrete outcomes+Bandeen-Roche, K; Miglioretti, DL; Zeger, SL; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1997::Statistical metrology - Measurement and modeling of variation for advanced process development and design rule generation+Boning, DS; Chung, JE+CHARACTERIZATION AND METROLOGY FOR ULSI TECHNOLOGY+1998::SEMICONDUCTOR YIELD IMPROVEMENT - RESULTS AND BEST PRACTICES+CUNNINGHAM, SP; SPANOS, CJ; VOROS, K+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING+MAY 1995::CONCOMITANT-VARIABLE LATENT-CLASS MODELS+DAYTON, CM; MACREADY, GB+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1988::Run-to-run process control: Literature review and extensions+DelCastillo, E; Hurwitz, AM+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 1997::A SYSTEM FOR SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESS SPECIFICATION+DURBECK, D; CHERN, JH; BONING, DS+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING+NOV 1993::Latent class regression on latent factors+Guo, J; Wall, M; Amemiya, Y+BIOSTATISTICS+JAN 2006::no title+Kleinbaum, DG; Klein, M.+Logistic Regression: A Self-Learning Text+2010::Application of Generalized Linear Models to Predict Semiconductor Yield Using Defect Metrology Data+Krueger, Dana C.; Montgomery, Douglas C.; Mastrangelo, Christina M.+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING+FEB 2011::A review of yield modelling techniques for semiconductor manufacturing+Kumar, N.; Kennedy, K.; Gildersleeve, K.; et al.+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH+DEC 1 2006::Hierarchical Modeling Using Generalized Linear Models+Kumar, Naveen; Mastrangelo, Christina; Montgomery, Doug+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+OCT 2011::no title+Kutner, M; Nachtsheim, C; Neter, J.+Applied linear statistical models+2005::no title+LECESSIE S+J R STAT SOC C-APPL+1992::RTSPC - A SOFTWARE UTILITY FOR REAL-TIME SPC AND TOOL DATA-ANALYSIS+LEE, SF; BOSKIN, ED; LIU, HC; et al.+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING+FEB 1995::no title+Montgomery, D.C.; Peck, E.A.; Vining, G.G.+Introduction to Linear Regression Analysis+2006::no title+MOYNE J+RUN RUN CONTROL SEMI+2000::A systems approach to semiconductor optimization+Newnes, LB; Mileham, TR; Doniavi, A+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRONICS PACKAGING MANUFACTURING+JUL 2001::REAL-TIME STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL USING TOOL DATA+SPANOS, CJ; GUO, HF; MILLER, A; et al.+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING+NOV 1992::Fact and fiction in yield modeling [ICs]+Stapper, C.H.+Microelectronics Journal+Spring 1989"
Statistical Surface Monitoring by Spatial-Structure Modeling,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2014,23,10,"In some manufacturing processes, the quality characteristic is represented by a two-dimensional (2-D) surface. Surface data can generally be treated as a special profile with one response variable and two explanatory variables, for which spatial correlations are commonly observed. Existing parametric charts for profile monitoring are unable to adequately describe the spatial correlations among variables in 2-D surface data, and nonparametric charts cannot be applied to a 2-D data structure directly. In this study, we propose a new chart based on the Gaussian-Kriging model, in which the spatial correlations within the 2-D surface profile are represented by a parametric function. We construct a parametric model that considers three components of the surface-the global trend, the spatial correlations, and independent errors. Then we monitor the process by detecting changes in the estimated parameters. We utilize this method to monitor a wafer-manufacturing process and compare its performance with that of an existing profile-monitoring method through simulation.","Gaussian-Kriging Model,Profile Monitoring,Spatial Correlation,Statistical Process Control,Surface Data","QUALITY PROFILES,CONTROL CHARTS,PRODUCT","Wang, Andi@Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China::Wang, Kaibo@Tsinghua Univ, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China::Tsung, Fugee@Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Wang, Andi@Hong Kong University of Science & Technology::Wang, Kaibo@Tsinghua University::Tsung, Fugee@Hong Kong University of Science & Technology",not exist,"Stochastic Kriging for Simulation Metamodeling+Ankenman, Bruce; Nelson, Barry L.; Staum, Jeremy+OPERATIONS RESEARCH+MAR-APR 2010::Quality Control for the Manufactured Surfaces+COLOSIMO, B.

Monitoring Product Size and Edging from Bivariate Profile Data,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2014,29,2,"Profile data consist of the coordinates of points along the edge of the product. Often, several hundred points are involved. Mechanical and automated procedures (e.g., scanning) are used in data gathering. The large data dimensionality presents challenges in the development of control charts to monitor product profiles. The data also show strong cross-correlations between points close to one another. In this article, using the leading principal components of the coordinate covariance matrix, we develop Hotel ling's T-2 and upper exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) charts to monitor product size. The methods are extended to monitor product edging using the angles between the normal vectors of the blueprint and sample profiles. We use a Markov chain approximation to calculate average run length. Through simulations, we assess the performance of the proposed methods and show the upper EWMA chart exhibit good performance in most of the off-target scenarios considered. A comparison with existing methods reveals that the proposed charts are very competitive and require fewer distributional assumptions.","Angular Vectors,Average Run Length,EWMA Chart,Hotel ling's T-2 Chart,Principal Components,Smoothing,SPC","MOVING AVERAGE SCHEMES,LINEAR PROFILES,PHASE-I,EWMA CHARTS","Viveros-Aguilera, Roman@McMaster Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada::Steiner, Stefan H.@Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada::MacKay, R.

A related challenge is the scarcity of available data partly because of security concerns. In this paper, we propose a method based on Markov decision processes (MDP) for the generation and graphical evaluation of relevant maintenance policies for cases with limited data availability. The proposed method also provides an estimate of the cost benefit of collecting additional data. Both Bayesian and non-Bayesian formulations of the transition probabilities and cost models are considered. We apply the proposed method to a real-world cyber-vulnerability dataset and generate specific guidance and cost predictions.

Dimensional Analysis and Its Applications in Statistics,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2014,27,12,"Dimensional analysis (DA) is a well-developed, widely-employed methodology in the physical and engineering sciences. The application of dimensional analysis in statistics leads to three advantages: (1) the reduction of the number of potential causal factors that we need to consider, (2) the analytical insights into the relations among variables that it generates, and (3) the scalability of results. The formalization of the dimensional-analysis method in statistical design and analysis gives a clear view of its generality and overlooked significance. In this paper, we first provide general procedures for dimensional analysis prior to statistical design and analysis. We illustrate the use of dimensional analysis with three practical examples. In the first example, we demonstrate the basic dimensional-analysis process in connection with a study of factors that affect vehicle stopping distance. The second example integrates dimensional analysis into the regression analysis of the pine tree data. In our third example, we show how dimensional analysis can be used to develop a superior experimental design for the well-known paper helicopter experiment. In the regression example and in the paper helicopter experiment, we compare results obtained via the dimensional-analysis approach to those obtained via conventional approaches. From those, we demonstrate the general properties of dimensional analysis from a statistical perspective and recommend its usage based on its favorable performance.","Buckingham's II Theorem,Design of Experiment,Dimensions,Statistical Analysis","EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGN,CATALYST","Shen, Weijie@Penn State Univ, Dept Stat, University Pk, PA 16802 USA::Davis, Tim@We Predict Ltd, Swansea SA1 8PH, W Glam, Wales::Lin, Dennis K.

Multimode Geometric-Profile Monitoring with Correlated Image Data and Its Application to Nanoparticle Self-Assembly Processes,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2014,59,3,"We propose a new method for monitoring changes in geometric profiles of objects, where the geometric profiles may change through various modes in a dynamic process. This work is motivated by the need for monitoring changes in geometric shape and sizes of nanoparticles during their chemical self-assembly process; the changes often occur through many different modes before converging to the final state. The proposed multimode geometric-profile monitoring method addresses three issues specific to this process, all of which have never been addressed together by existing process-monitoring methods profiling of functional data, monitoring of multimode processes, and monitoring of time-correlated processes. The new profile-monitoring method consists of two phases. In phase I, we characterize multiple modes of geometric shape changes under in-control process conditions given a sequence of geometric observations on products. We propose using a mixture of time-series models for this characterization and present an exact Gibbs sampling procedure for Bayesian estimation of model parameters. In phase II, we test whether a new observation of product geometries sampled at a certain time in the current process run exhibits significant out-of-control symptoms. We propose a Bayes factor score-based criteria for this testing. The proposed method is empirically verified using simulated datasets and a real dataset from a nanoparticle self-assembly process.","Autocorrelated Process,Bayes Factor,Functional Data,Growth Processes,Mixture of Time Series,Nanomanufacturing","STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,GAUSSIAN MIXTURE MODEL,CONTROL CHARTS,NONPARAMETRIC ALTERNATIVES,LINEAR PROFILES,MEDICAL STATISTICS,BAYESIAN-INFERENCE,LIKELIHOOD,SHAPE","Park, Chiwoo@Florida State Univ, Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA::Shrivastava, Abhishek K.@Florida State Univ, Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Park, Chiwoo@Florida State University@State University System of Florida::Shrivastava, Abhishek K.@Florida State University@State University System of Florida",not exist,"TIME-SERIES MODELING FOR STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL+ALWAN, LC; ROBERTS, HV+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JAN 1988::NONPARAMETRIC QUALITY-CONTROL CHARTS BASED ON THE SIGN STATISTIC+AMIN, RW; REYNOLDS, MR; BAKIR, S+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1995::The GLRT for statistical process control of autocorrelated processes+Apley, DW; Shi, J+IIE TRANSACTIONS+SEP 1999::Marginal likelihood and Bayes factors for Dirichlet process mixture models+Basu, S; Chib, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2003::Bayesian and conditional frequentist testing of a parametric model versus nonparametric alternatives+Berger, JO; Guglielmi, A+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2001::Nonparametric Multivariate Control Charts Based on a Linkage Ranking Algorithm+Bush, Helen Meyers; Chongfuangprinya, Panitarn; Chen, Victoria C.

From Profile to Surface Monitoring: SPC for Cylindrical Surfaces Via Gaussian Processes,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2014,47,15,"Quality of machined products is often related to the shapes of surfaces that are constrained by geometric tolerances. In this case, statistical quality monitoring should be used to quickly detect unwanted deviations from the nominal pattern. The majority of the literature has focused on statistical profile monitoring, while there is little research on surface monitoring. This paper faces the challenging task of moving from profile to surface monitoring. To this aim, different parametric approaches and control-charting procedures are presented and compared with reference to a real case study dealing with cylindrical surfaces obtained by lathe turning. In particular, a novel method presented in this paper consists of modeling the manufactured surface via Gaussian processes models and monitoring the deviations of the actual surface from the target pattern estimated in phase I. Regardless of the specific case study in this paper, the proposed approach is general and can be extended to deal with different kinds of surfaces or profiles.","Cylindrical Surfaces,Geometric Specifications,GP Model,Kriging,Profile Monitoring,Spatial Statistics","CONTROL CHARTS,ROUNDNESS PROFILES,MACHINED PARTS,PARAMETERS,VARIABLES,MATRICES,DESIGNS","Colosimo, Bianca M.@Politecn Milan, Dept Mech Engn, I-20156 Milan, Italy::Cicorella, Paolo@Politecn Milan, Dept Mech Engn, I-20156 Milan, Italy::Pacella, Massimo@Univ Salento, Dept Engn Innovat, I-73100 Lecce, Italy::Blaco, Marzia@Univ Salento, Dept Engn Innovat, I-73100 Lecce, Italy","Colosimo, Bianca M.@Polytechnic University of Milan::Cicorella, Paolo@Polytechnic University of Milan::Pacella, Massimo@University of Salento::Blaco, Marzia@University of Salento","Pacella, Massimo@I-5561-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3712-7932","ON THE CONDITION NUMBER OF COVARIANCE MATRICES IN KRIGING, ESTIMATION, AND SIMULATION OF RANDOM-FIELDS+ABABOU, R; BAGTZOGLOU, AC; WOOD, EF+MATHEMATICAL GEOLOGY+JAN 1994::Nonparametric and semiparametirc mixed models mthods for phase I profile monitoring+Abdel-Salam, AG; Birch, JB; Jensen, WA.+Technical Report+2010::no title+Amiri, A.; Noorossana, R.; Saghaei, A.+Statistical Analysis of Profile Monitoring+2012::On geodetic distance computations in spatial modeling+Banerjee, S+BIOMETRICS+JUN 2005::Properties of the T-2 control chart when parameters are estimated+Champ, CW; Jones-Farmer, LA; Rigdon, SE+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 2005::A Multivariate Robust Control Chart for Individual Observations+Chenouri, Shoja'eddin; Steiner, Stefan H.; Variyath, Asokan Mulayath+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 2009::Nonparametric Profile Monitoring by Mixed Effects Modeling Comment+Chipman, Hugh A.; Mackay, R.

Individual T-2 Control Chart for Compositional Data,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2014,24,6,"The usual Hotel ling T-2 control chart is not appropriate for monitoring processes where the quality characteristic is a mixture. The composition of mixtures are vectors of positive elements that represent parts of a whole, to which standard multivariate techniques are not appropriate due to their restricted sample space. There are many applications where a mixture is monitored against time, such as in the chemical industry, product composition, impurity profile, or gas components analysis. In this paper, a multivariate control chart for individual compositional observations based on the T-2 statistic is proposed and compared with the typical one in terms of average run length. We show how results are more consistent with compositional data nature and illustrate implementation in a real-world example.","Average Run Length,Hotelling's T-2 Statistic,Log Ratio,Mixture Data,Multivariate Control Chart,Simplex,Statistical Process Control","MULTIVARIATE CONTROL CHARTS,PARAMETERS","Vives-Mestres, Marina@Univ Girona, PIV Campus Montilivi, Dept Comp Sci Appl Math & Stat, Girona 17071, Spain::Daunis-I-Estadella, Josep@Univ Girona, PIV Campus Montilivi, Dept Comp Sci Appl Math & Stat, Girona 17071, Spain::Martin-Fernandez, Josep-Antoni@Univ Girona, PIV Campus Montilivi, Dept Comp Sci Appl Math & Stat, Girona 17071, Spain","Vives-Mestres, Marina@Universitat de Girona::Daunis-I-Estadella, Josep@Universitat de Girona::Martin-Fernandez, Josep-Antoni@Universitat de Girona","Vives-Mestres, Marina@C-4718-2011::Martin-Fernandez, Josep-Antoni@B-9208-2011@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2366-1592::Daunis-i-Estadella, Pepus@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6134-9255","Compositional data analysis: Where are we and where should we be heading?+Aitchison, J; Egozcue, JJ+MATHEMATICAL GEOLOGY+OCT 2005::The statistical analysis of compositional data+Aitchison, J.+MONOGRAPHS STAT APPL+1986::A short history of compositional data analysis+Bacon-Shone, John+COMPOSITIONAL DATA ANALYSIS: THEORY AND APPLICATIONS+2011::Singularity and nonnormality in the classification of compositional data - Comment+Barcelo-Vidal, C; Pawlowsky-Glahn, V+MATHEMATICAL GEOLOGY+JUL 1999::Using the chi-square statistic to monitor compositional process data+Boyles, RA+JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS+OCT 1997::Properties of the T-2 control chart when parameters are estimated+Champ, CW; Jones-Farmer, LA; Rigdon, SE+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 2005::Groups of parts and their balances in compositional data analysis+Egozcue, JJ; Pawlowsky-Glahn, V+MATHEMATICAL GEOLOGY+OCT 2005::Isometric logratio transformations for compositional data analysis+Egozcue, JJ; Pawlowsky-Glahn, V; Mateu-Figueras, G; et al.+MATHEMATICAL GEOLOGY+APR 2003::Application of the Multivariate T&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;Control Chart and the Mason-Tracy-Young Decomposition Procedure to the Study of the Consistency of Impurity Profiles of Drug Substances+GONZALEZ-DE LA Parra, M.; RODRIGUEZ-LOAIZA, P.+Quality Engineering+2003::no title+HOLMES DS+QUAL ENG+1993::no title+Kenett, R.

Exact Inferences for a Gamma Distribution,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2014,15,1,"A random sample from a two-parameter gamma distribution is considered, and it is shown how exact inferences can be obtained for properties of the distribution. Kolmogorov tests based on the empirical cumulative-distribution function of the data are inverted to construct an exact confidence set for the two parameters. This can be used, for example, to construct exact confidence bands for the cumulative-distribution function of the gamma distribution, which also provide simultaneous inferences on the quantiles of the distribution. The exact confidence set can also provide confidence intervals for the individual parameters and for other functions of the parameters, such as the mean of the distribution. The new methodology is computationally straightforward and examples of its implementation are provided. Comparisons are made with standard approximate inference procedures that rely on asymptotic properties of maximum-likelihood estimates of the parameters and with a Bayesian simulation approach. The methodology can also be used to test whether a data set can be modeled with a gamma distribution and to test whether independent data sets can be modeled with a common gamma distribution.","Confidence Band,Confidence Interval,Confidence Set,Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function,Gamma Distribution,Kolmogorov Bands,Quantiles,Reliability Function",INTERVAL,"Hayter, A.

Assessing the Capability of a Manufacturing Process Using Nonparametric Bayesian Density Estimation,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2014,36,2,"The capability of a manufacturing process refers to the ability of the process to produce items that are within set specifications. The determination of the capability of a stable manufacturing process with a multivariate quality characteristic using standard methods usually requires the assumption that the quality characteristic of interest follows a multivariate normal distribution, an assumption that is difficult to assess in practice. Departures from this assumption can result in erroneous conclusions, which can be costly to the manufacturer. In this paper, we propose assessing the capability of a process using a nonparametric Bayesian framework. This framework relies on using mixtures of Dirichlet processes to elicit a prior on the multivariate distribution of the quality characteristic. The posterior distribution of the distribution of the quality characteristic can then be used to induce a posterior distribution on the process fallout rate, the mean distance between the quality characteristic and a specified target value, or on an associated process capability index. The methodology is demonstrated through three examples using real-world data. Particular emphasis in these examples is given toward specifying the parameter values required to specify the prior distribution and on interpretation of the results.","Dirichlet Distribution,Normal Mixture,Process Fallout Rate,Process Yield","POLYA TREE,DISTRIBUTIONS,INFERENCE,MIXTURES,INDEXES,YIELD","Polansky, Alan M.@No Illinois Univ, Div Stat, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA","Polansky, Alan M.@Northern Illinois University",not exist,"MIXTURES OF DIRICHLET PROCESSES WITH APPLICATIONS TO BAYESIAN NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS+ANTONIAK, CE+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1974::no title+Bernardo, J.

Design and Evaluation of Accelerated Life Testing Plans with Dual Objectives,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2014,28,5,"Accelerated life testing (ALT) is widely used in industry to predict product lifetime and lifetime distribution. Optimal test plans based on statistical optimality criteria, such as D-optimality or U-c-optimality, have recently been explored in Monroe et al. (2010, 2011). However, in these studies, the product use condition was set at a constant; in reality, use stress may vary due to a changing product use environment. In this paper, we consider an I-optimality that minimizes the variance of lifetime prediction over the entire region of possible use conditions. In addition, we investigate the tradeoffs between model parameter estimation and model-based prediction for ALT test plans. Dual-objective optimal test plans are provided to experimenters so that they can make a decision to balance the plan's estimation and prediction properties. We employ some graphical tools, including fraction of use space (FUS) plot, efficiency plot, and Pareto frontier plot, to evaluate different test plans and to compare our proposed method with existing ones in literature.","Design of Experiments,D-Optimality,I-Optimality,Multi-Objective Decision Analysis,Reliability Testing","EXTREME-VALUE DISTRIBUTIONS,RESPONSE-SURFACE DESIGNS,FAILURE TIME DATA,PREDICTION CAPABILITY,WEIBULL,MODEL","Pan, Rong@Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA::Yang, Tao@Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Pan, Rong@Arizona State University::Yang, Tao@Arizona State University",not exist,"The fitting of exponential, Weibull and extreme value distributions to complex censored survival data using GLIM+Aitkin, M.; Clayton, D.+Applied Statistics+1980::no title+Collett, D.+Modelling Survival Data in Medical Research+2003::Optimal design of proportional hazards based accelerated life testing plans+Elsayed, EA; Jiao, LX+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATERIALS &amp; PRODUCT TECHNOLOGY+2002::PLANNING ACCELERATED LIFE TESTS WITH 2 OR MORE EXPERIMENTAL FACTORS+ESCOBAR, LA; MEEKER, WQ+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1995::A PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODEL FOR INTERVAL-CENSORED FAILURE TIME DATA+FINKELSTEIN, DM+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1986::A SEMIPARAMETRIC MODEL FOR REGRESSION-ANALYSIS OF INTERVAL-CENSORED FAILURE TIME DATA+FINKELSTEIN, DM; WOLFE, RA+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1985::GRAPHICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE PREDICTION CAPABILITY OF RESPONSE-SURFACE DESIGNS+GIOVANNITTIJENSEN, A; MYERS, RH+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 1989::OPTIMAL-DESIGN OF ACCELERATED LIFE TESTS FOR THE WEIBULL DISTRIBUTION UNDER PERIODIC INSPECTION AND TYPE-I CENSORING+ISLAM, A; AHMAD, N+MICROELECTRONICS AND RELIABILITY+SEP 1994::Multi-objective optimization using genetic algorithms: A tutorial+Konak, Abdullah; Coit, David W.; Smith, Alice E.+RELIABILITY ENGINEERING &amp; SYSTEM SAFETY+SEP 2006::no title+McCullagh, P.; Nelder, J.+Generalized Linear Models+1989::Investigating Design for Survival Models+McGree, J.

Batch Variability in Accelerated-Degradation Testing,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2014,8,5,"Problem: The study that motivated this article concerns the development of a new seal to be used in a high-pressure application. A weakened seal would not only adversely affect the overall device performance but it could also lead to potential safety concerns. The seal was designed to perform for 10 years in the application environment. The development team had undertaken a temperature accelerated test to study the degradation of seal strength. The ad hoc procedure used to fit an engineering model to the data did not readily allow estimation of lower quantiles of the strength distribution and obtaining statistical confidence bounds on quantities of interest. The authors were approached for advice on statistical analysis and modeling of the data in order to guide engineering and management decision making.

Approach: In our initial analysis of the data, we used a standard statistical model based on the engineering relationship for seal-strength and temperature. The analysis of residuals from the maximum-likelihood fit of the model revealed an additional source of variation in the data that had not been accounted for. This finding cast doubt on the inferences that resulted from the standard statistical model due to the inadequacy of the model in representing the data. We extended the standard model to accommodate this new source of variability through nonlinear mixed effects modeling.

Results: The extended model was shown to adequately account for the excess source of variation in the data. The inferences based on this model showed greater uncertainty and highlighted the need to identify and mitigate the root cause of the variation. A narrow consulting question led to a significant discovery that paved the way for a meaningful engagement with the seal team.

The posterior consumer's and producer's risks are used as the criteria for developing the test plan. Using the previous component information reduces the number of tests needed to achieve the same levels of risk. The proposed methodology is illustrated with two examples.,"Consumer's and Producer's Posterior Risk,Demonstration Test,Hierarchical Model",,"Hamada, M.

A Control Chart Based on A Nonparametric Multivariate Change-Point Model,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2014,21,12,"Phase-II statistical process control (SPC) procedures are designed to detect a change in distribution when a possibly never-ending stream of observations is collected. Several techniques have been proposed to detect a shift in location vector when each observation consists of multiple measurements. These procedures require the user to make assumptions about the distribution of the process readings, to assume that process parameters are known, or to collect a large training sample before monitoring the ongoing process for a change in distribution. We propose a nonparametric procedure for multivariate phase-II statistical process control designed to detect shifts in location vector that relaxes these requirements based on an approximately distribution free multivariate test statistic. This procedure may not be appropriate for some multivariate distributions with unusual dependence structure between vector components. A diagnostic tool that can be used if a historical sample of data is available is provided to assist user in determining if the proposed procedure is appropriate for a given application.","Location Test,Phase-II Statistical Process Control","STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,QUALITY-CONTROL,ROBUSTNESS","Holland, Mark D.@Beckman Coulter Inc, Chaska, MN 55318 USA::Hawkins, Douglas M.@Univ Minnesota, Sch Stat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Holland, Mark D.@Unknow::Hawkins, Douglas M.@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities",not exist,"An approach to multivariate rank tests in multivariate analysis of variance+Choi, K; Marden, J+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1997::MULTIVARIATE GENERALIZATIONS OF CUMULATIVE SUM QUALITY-CONTROL SCHEMES+CROSIER, RB+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 1988::no title+Ferguson, T.+A course in large sample theory+1996::The changepoint model for statistical process control+Hawkins, DM; Qiu, PH; Kang, CW+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 2003::REGRESSION ADJUSTMENT FOR VARIABLES IN MULTIVARIATE QUALITY-CONTROL+HAWKINS, DM+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1993::A Nonparametric Change-Point Control Chart+Hawkins, Douglas M.; Deng, Qiqi+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 2010::no title+HOLLAND, M.

Application of Bayesian Methods in Reliability Data Analyses,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2014,30,14,"The development of the theory and application of Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods, vast improvements in computational capabilities, and emerging software alternatives have made it possible for more frequent use of Bayesian methods in reliability applications. Bayesian methods, however, remain controversial in reliability (and some other applications) because of the concern about from where the needed prior distributions should come. On the other hand, there are many applications where engineers have solid prior information on certain aspects of their reliability problems based on physics of failure or previous experience with the same failure mechanism. For example, engineers often have useful but imprecise knowledge about the effective activation energy in a temperature-accelerated life test or about the Weibull shape parameter in the analysis of fatigue-failure data. In such applications, the use of Bayesian methods is compelling, as it offers an appropriate compromise between assuming that such quantities are known and assuming that nothing is known. In this paper, we compare the use of Bayesian methods with the traditional maximum-likelihood methods for a group Of examples, including the analysis of field data with multiple censoring, accelerated life-test data, and accelerated degradation-test data.","Accelerated Test,Degradation,Likelihood,MCMC,OpenBUGS,Prior Information","DISTRIBUTIONS,PROBABILITY","Li, Ming@Gen Elect Global Res Ctr, Appl Stat Lab, Niskayuna, NY 12309 USA::Meeker, William Q.@Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA 50011 USA","Li, Ming@General Electric::Meeker, William Q.@Iowa State University",not exist,"no title+Abernethy, RB; Breneman, JE; Medlin, CH<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Reinman, GL</span>.+Technical Report AFWAL-TR-83-2079+1983::An Introduction to R+Albert, Jim+BAYESIAN COMPUTATION WITH R, SECOND EDITION+2009::Markov Chain Simulation for Estimating Accelerated Life Model Parameters+AZARKHAIL, M.; MODARRES, M.+REL MAINT S RAMS 200+2007::no title+Carlin, B.

A Framework for Initial Experimental Design in the Presence of Competing Prior Knowledge,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2013,20,3,"An initial experimental design criteria is proposed for optimization problems by combining multiple, potentially competing, sources of prior information engineering models, expert opinion, and data from past experimentation on similar, nonidentical systems. By leveraging prior information, resources used for the initial experiments are already targeted toward the optimization problem, potentially reducing the total number of resources needed in follow-up experimentation. New methodology, applicable to both computer and physical experiments, is provided for incorporating and combining conjectured models and data into both the initial modeling and experimental design stages. As a result, the experimental design criteria is flexible in how it balances space filling and objective oriented properties in the presence of conjectured prior information. An application to a thin-film growth study is provided in addition to a detailed numerical study of the design properties.","Combined Information,Engineering Models,Expert Knowledge,Hierarchical Bayesian Model,Trust Model","SUPERCRITICAL CARBON-DIOXIDE,ENGINEERING MODELS,NANOPARTICLES,COMPUTER,DEPOSITION,ALGORITHM","Vastola, Justin T.@Georgia Inst Technol, H Milton Stewart Sch Ind & Syst Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA::Lu, Jye-Chyi@Georgia Inst Technol, H Milton Stewart Sch Ind & Syst Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA::Casciato, Michael J.@Unknow::Hess, Dennis W.@Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Chem & Biomol Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA::Grover, Martha A.@Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Chem & Biomol Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Vastola, Justin T.@Georgia Institute of Technology@University System of Georgia::Lu, Jye-Chyi@Georgia Institute of Technology@University System of Georgia::Casciato, Michael J.@Unknow::Hess, Dennis W.@Georgia Institute of Technology@University System of Georgia::Grover, Martha A.@Georgia Institute of Technology@University System of Georgia",not exist,"Initial Experimental Design Methodology Incorporating Expert Conjecture, Prior Data, and Engineering Models for Deposition of Iridium Nanoparticles in Supercritical Carbon Dioxide+Casciato, Michael J.; Vastola, Justin T.; Lu, J.

Tips for Analyzing Nonregular Fractional Factorial Experiments,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2013,40,5,"Plackett-Burman designs and other two-level nonregular fractional factorial designs are popular for identifying the active factors from a large list of experimental factors. Data analysis for these designs is straightforward if interactions can be safely ignored. However, rather than viewing interactions as a hazard, methods have recently been proposed to identify and estimate active interaction effects via nonregular factorial designs. The purpose of this article is to suggest approaches that the author has found useful and to caution against unrealistic attempts for finding many interactions. If interactions are anticipated, the use of designs with more runs than double the number of factors is strongly encouraged.","All-Subsets Regression,Effect Heredity,Forward Selection,Generalized Alias Length Pattern,LARS,Orthogonal Array,Partial Aliasing,Plackett-Burman Design,Regression Tree,SAMS","HIDDEN PROJECTION PROPERTIES,ORTHOGONAL ARRAYS,SUPERSATURATED DESIGNS,PLACKETT-BURMAN,SELECTION","Mee, Robert W.@Univ Tennessee, Dept Stat Operat & Management Sci, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA","Mee, Robert W.@University of Tennessee System@University of Tennessee Knoxville",not exist,"Experimental design on the front lines of marketing: Testing new ideas to increase direct mail sales+Bell, Gordon H.; Ledolter, Johannes; Swersey, Arthur J.+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN MARKETING+SEP 2006::SOME SYSTEMATIC SUPERSATURATED DESIGNS+BOOTH, KHV; COX, DR+TECHNOMETRICS+1962::Projective properties of certain orthogonal arrays+Box, G; Tyssedal, J+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1996::Classification of orthogonal arrays by integer programming+Bulutoglu, D.

An Adaptation of the Bergman Hynen Test for Dispersion Effects in Unreplicated Two-Level Factorial Designs When the Location Model May Be Incorrect,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2013,27,1,"In the analysis of unreplicated two-level factorial experiments, it is well established that pairs of active location effects that are not identified as active can cause a disturbance in the data that interferes with standard tests and estimates for dispersion effects. An amendment to the dispersion-effect test of Bergman and Hynen (1997) is proposed to make it robust against confounding by location effects. The cost of this robustness is only one degree of freedom from the numerator and denominator of the reference F distribution. Simulations demonstrate a newfound problem with the Bergman Hynen test and show that the proposed amendment fixes this problem.","Confounding,Location Effects,Normal Plot,Robust Parameter Design,Screening Experiments","FRACTIONAL FACTORIALS,ESTIMATORS","Loughin, Thomas M.@Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada::Malone, Christopher J.@Winona State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Winona, MN 55987 USA","Loughin, Thomas M.@Simon Fraser University::Malone, Christopher J.@Winona State University",not exist,"Dispersion Effects from Unreplicated Designs in the 2&lt;SUP&gt;k&lt;/SUP&gt;p Series+Bergman, B.; Hynen, A.+Technontetrics+1997::Follow-up experiments to verify dispersion effects: Taguchi's welding experiment+Bisgaard, S.; Pinho, A.+Quality Engineering+2003-2004::A method to identify dispersion effects from unreplicated multilevel experiments+Blomkvist, O; Hynen, A; Bergman, B+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+MAY-JUN 1997::AN ANALYSIS FOR UNREPLICATED FRACTIONAL FACTORIALS+BOX, GEP; MEYER, RD+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1986::Methods for identifying dispersion effects in unreplicated factorial experiments: A critical analysis and proposed strategies+Brenneman, WA; Nair, VN+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 2001::Screening experiments for dispersion effects+Bursztyn, D.; Steinberg, D.

Control Charts for Simultaneous Monitoring of Unknown Mean and Variance of Normally Distributed Processes,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2013,23,14,"Phase II Shewhart-type control charts are considered for simultaneous monitoring of the mean and variance of a normally distributed process when both of these parameters are unknown and are estimated from an in-control (IC) Phase I reference sample. The charts are based on single plotting statistics obtained by suitably modifying two popular existing charts in the literature (the max chart and the distance chart) for the known parameter case. Control limits for the proposed charts are tabulated for practical implementation. Follow-up procedures are considered for both charts for post-signal detection of the type of shift. A comprehensive simulation study is carried out to investigate the IC and out-of-control (OOC) performance properties of the charts in terms of the average, the standard deviation, the median, and some percentiles of the run-length distribution. The modified max chart is found to be preferable for detecting a larger shift in the mean accompanied by a smaller shift in the variance. In all other situations, the modified distance chart displays better performance. A numerical example is given for illustration. Summary and conclusions are offered.","Distance Chart,Joint Monitoring,Max Chart,Parameter Estimation,Phase I and Phase II Charts,Shewhart Chart","LIKELIHOOD RATIO TEST,ONE EWMA CHART,X-BAR CHART,VARIABILITY,SHIFTS","McCracken, A.

Differential Smoothing in the Bivariate Exponentially Weighted Moving Average Chart,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2013,18,2,"The multivariate exponentially weighted moving average (MEWMA) control chart proposed by Lowry et al. (1992) has become one of the most widely used charts to monitor multivariate processes. Its simplicity, combined with its high sensitivity to small and moderate process mean jumps, is at the core of its appeal. Lowry et al. (1992) advocated equal smoothing of each quality variable unless there is an a priori reason to weight quality characteristics differently. However, one may have situations where differential smoothing may be justified. For instance: (a) departures in process mean may be different across quality variables, (b) some variables may evolve over time at a much different pace than other variables, and (c) the level of correlation between variables could vary substantially. Here, we assess the performance of the differentially smoothed MEWMA chart. The case of two quality variables (BEWMA) is discussed in detail. A bivariate Markov-chain method that uses conditional distributions is developed for average run-length (ARL) calculations. The proposed chart is shown to perform at least as well as Lowry et al. (1992)'5 chart and noticeably better in many mean-jump directions. Comparisons with the recently introduced doubles-moothed BEWMA chart and the use of univariate charts for the independent case show that the proposed differentially smoothed BEWMA chart has superior performance.","Average Run Length,Differential Smoothing,Markov-Chain Method,Optimal ARL,Robustness,Sensitivity Analysis","INTEGRAL-EQUATION,CONTROL SCHEMES,RUN-LENGTH","Huh, Ick@McMaster Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada::Viveros-Aguilera, Roman@McMaster Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada::Balakrishnan, Narayanaswamy@McMaster Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada","Huh, Ick@McMaster University::Viveros-Aguilera, Roman@McMaster University::Balakrishnan, Narayanaswamy@McMaster University",not exist,"A Double Multivariate Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (dMEWMA) Control Chart for a Process Location Monitoring+Alkahtani, Saad; Schaffer, Jay+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+2012::MULTIVARIATE GENERALIZATIONS OF CUMULATIVE SUM QUALITY-CONTROL SCHEMES+CROSIER, RB+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 1988::A general Multivariate exponentially weighted moving-average control chart+Hawkins, Douglas M.; Choi, Sungwoon; Lee, Sanghoon+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 2007::A multivariate exponentially weighted moving average control chart+Lowry, C.; Woodall, W.H.; Champ, C.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Rigdon, S</span>.+Technometrics+1992::EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE CONTROL SCHEMES - PROPERTIES AND ENHANCEMENTS+LUCAS, JM; SACCUCCI, MS+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1990::An Evaluation of the Double Exponentially Weighted Moving Average Control Chart+Mahmoud, Mahmoud A.; Woodall, William H.+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+2010::no title+Montgomery, D.

More Pitfalls of Accelerated Tests,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2013,29,7,"As product-development cycles become shorter and companies demand more rapid achievement of reliability goals, it is becoming more and more important to use quantitative accelerated life tests (ALT) to predict and improve reliability. Today there is an abundance of methods to plan and analyze accelerated tests, but there are also many pitfalls. This paper identifies some major problems and concerns in conducting and interpreting the results of accelerated tests. We identify various pitfalls, such as using an equal unit allocation at all levels of an accelerating variable, using unnecessarily complex testing and data analysis schemes, attempting to predict life from a HALT, using ALT at the system level, not having adequate time-to-failure information, using extreme extrapolation, ignoring the impact of idle time in use-rate acceleration tests, and not understanding interactions between accelerating variables.","Accelerated Degradation,Acceleration Factor,Activation Energy,Arrhenius,Extrapolation,Life-Stress Relationship,Quantitative Accelerated Life Testing",LIFE TESTS,"Meeker, William Q.@Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA 50011 USA::Sarakakis, Georgios@Tesla Motors, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA::Gerokostopoulos, Athanasios@ReliaSoft Corp, Tucson, AZ 85710 USA","Meeker, William Q.@Iowa State University::Sarakakis, Georgios@Unknow::Gerokostopoulos, Athanasios@Unknow",not exist,"The Round Cell: Promises vs. Results 30 Years Later+CANNONE, A; CANTOR, W.

Accelerated Test Methods for Reliability Prediction,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2013,53,4,"Perusal of quality- and reliability-engineering literature indicates some confusion over the meaning of accelerated life testing (ALT), highly accelerated life testing (HALT), highly accelerated stress screening (HASS), and highly accelerated stress auditing (HASA). In addition, there is a significant conflict between testing as part of an iterative process of finding and removing defects and testing as a means of estimating or predicting product reliability. We review the basics of these testing methods and describe how they relate to statistical methods for estimation and prediction of reliability and reliability growth.

The Effect of Aggregating Data When Monitoring a Poisson Process,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2013,22,11,"The aggregation of event counts is a common, and often necessary, practice in many applications. When working with large numbers of events, it may be more practical to consider the number of events occurring during time intervals of a given length rather than the individual interarrival times between successive events. However, when data collection or summarization is done only at the end of aggregation periods, e.g., days, weeks, months, or quarters, there is the potential for significant information loss. In public-health and safety applications, this data lag could lead to unnecessary injuries and deaths because of a delay in detecting an increased risk. In our paper, we assume an underlying Poisson process and study the effect of aggregation by investigating the relative performance of the cumulative sum (CUSUM) control chart for monitoring with Poisson-distributed aggregated data and the CUSUM chart based on exponentially distributed time-between-events data. By comparing steady-state chart performance for varying aggregation periods, we show that the adverse effect of aggregation can be significant.","Data Aggregation,Exponential CUSUM Chart,Poisson CUSUM Chart,Public Health,Safety","QUALITY-CONTROL METHODS,CONTROL CHARTS,HOSPITAL EPIDEMIOLOGY,INFECTION-CONTROL,CUSUM CHARTS,PROPORTION,BERNOULLI","Schuh, Anna@Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Woodall, William H.@Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Camelio, Jaime A.@Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Schuh, Anna@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Woodall, William H.@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Camelio, Jaime A.@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University",not exist,"Statistical quality control methods in infection control and hospital epidemiology, part II: Chart use, statistical properties, and research issues+Benneyan, JC+INFECTION CONTROL AND HOSPITAL EPIDEMIOLOGY+APR 1998::Statistical quality control methods in infection control and hospital epidemiology, part I: Introduction and basic theory+Benneyan, JC+INFECTION CONTROL AND HOSPITAL EPIDEMIOLOGY+MAR 1998::Fatal work injuries, by industry and contractor-adjusted industry, by selected industry, 2012+no author+Injuries, illnesses, and fatalities+2013::Poisson EWMA control charts+Borror, CM; Champ, CW; Rigdon, SE+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 1998::Role of data aggregation in biosurveillance detection strategies with applications from ESSENCE.+Burkom, Howard S; Elbert, Y; Feldman, A; et al.+MMWR supplements+2004-Sep-24::The Role of Data Aggregation in Public Health and Food Safety Surveillance+DUBRAWSKI, A.+Biosurveillance-Methods and Case Studies+2011::DESIGN OF OPTIMAL EXPONENTIAL CUSUM CONTROL CHARTS+GAN, FF+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 1994::A comparison of CUSUM, EWMA, and temporal scan statistics for detection of increases in Poisson rates+Han, SW; Tsui, KL.; Ariyajunya, B<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Kim, SB</span>.+Quality and Reliability Engineering International+2009::COUNTED DATA CUSUMS+LUCAS, JM+TECHNOMETRICS+1985::no title+Montgomery, D.

Phase I Distribution-Free Analysis of Univariate Data,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2013,26,11,"In Phase I analysis, data are used retrospectively for checking process stability and defining the in-control state. Most Phase I control charts are based on the assumption of normally distributed observations. However, distribution-free methods appear to be ideal candidates for Phase I applications. Indeed, because little information is available, it is difficult to validate a distributional assumption in Phase I or at least at its beginning stage. In addition, as has been noted in the literature, this assumption cannot be checked before process stability is established. In this article, we propose a new distribution-free Phase I procedure for univariate observations. The suggested method, based on recursive segmentation and permutation, detects single or multiple mean and/or scale shifts. A simulation study shows that our method compares favorably with parametric control charts when the process is normally distributed and performs better than other nonparametric control charts when the process distribution is skewed or heavy tailed. An R package can be found in the supplemental materials.","Change Points,Control Charts,Nonparametric Models,Statistical Process Control","STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,CONTROL CHARTS,INDIVIDUAL OBSERVATIONS","Capizzi, Giovanna@Univ Padua, I-35121 Padua, Italy::Masarotto, Guido@Univ Padua, I-35121 Padua, Italy","Capizzi, Giovanna@University of Padua::Masarotto, Guido@University of Padua",not exist,"Adaptive Generalized Likelihood Ratio Control Charts for Detecting Unknown Patterned Mean Shifts+Capizzi, Giovanna; Masarotto, Guido+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 2012::A Least Angle Regression Control Chart for Multidimensional Data+Capizzi, Giovanna; Masarotto, Guido+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 2011::A Phase II Non Parametric Control Chart Based on Precedence Statistics with Runs-Type Signaling Rules+CHAKRABORTI, S.; ERYILMAZ, S.; HUMAN, S.

Point-Source Detection Using Gamma-Ray Spectra in Radiation-portal Monitoring,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2013,16,0,"Problem: Radiation detection systems are deployed at U.S. borders to guard against illicit entry of radioactive material. Unfortunately, nuisance alarms due to naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM) reduce detection probabilities for threat sources. This paper evaluates to what extent gamma counts for a range of energies (i.e., a gamma spectrum) deployed in primary screening can detect threat-point sources, with attention to background-suppression effects.

Approach: It is assumed that most NORM sources are more spatially distributed than a point source and that most threat sources are distributed more like a point source. Therefore, we seek a high-alarm probability for vehicle profiles that exhibit a point-like shift in spectral shape. The proposed approach uses variation of the gamma spectral shape over time as a moving vehicle carrying a point source is screened.

Results: The paper uses data from approximately 2000 real vehicle screenings to develop alarm thresholds and to evaluate detection probabilities of injected threat sources from both NORM and threat isotopes. It is shown that transforming the raw gamma spectra is advantageous and that using the Mahalanobis distance to detect the point-like shift in spectral shape is superior to a spectral distance used in the literature.","Background Suppression,Mahalanobis Distance,Scan Statistic,Spectral Distance,Time Series",SUPPRESSION,"Burr, Tom@Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM 87544 USA::Hamada, Michael S.@Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM 87544 USA::Myers, Kary@Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM 87544 USA::Skurikhin, Misha@Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM 87544 USA","Burr, Tom@Los Alamos National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)::Hamada, Michael S.@Los Alamos National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)::Myers, Kary@Los Alamos National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)::Skurikhin, Misha@Los Alamos National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)",not exist,"Smoothing Low Resolution Gamma Spectra+Burr, T.; Hengartner, N.; Matzner-Lober, E.; et al.+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE+OCT 2010::Statistical Evaluation of the Impact of Background Suppression on the Sensitivity of Passive Radiation Detectors+BURR, T.; GATTIKER, J.; MULLEN, M.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; TOMPKINS, G</span>.+STAT METHODS COUNTER+2006::Effects of background suppression of gamma counts on signal estimation+Burr, Tom; Myers, Kary+APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES+SEP 2009::Signatures for several types of naturally occurring radioactive materials+Burr, Tom; Myers, Kary+APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES+SEP 2008::DETECTION OF RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL ENTERING NATIONAL PORTS: A BAYESIAN APPROACH TO RADIATION PORTAL DATA+Dalal, Siddhartha R.; Han, Bing+ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS+SEP 2010::The use of energy windowing to discriminate SNM from NORM in radiation portal monitors+Ely, J; Kouzes, R; Schweppe, J; et al.+NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS &amp; METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT+MAY 10 2006::Overview of portal monitoring at border crossings+Geelhood, BD; Ely, JH; Hansen, RR; et al.+2003 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM, CONFERENCE RECORD, VOLS 1-5+2004::no title+Glaz, J; Naus, J.

Definitive Screening Designs with Added Two-Level Categorical Factors,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2013,8,21,"Recently, Jones and Nachtsheim (2011) proposed a new class of designs called definitive screening designs (DSDs). These designs have three levels, provide estimates of main effects that are unbiased by any second-order effect, require only one more than twice as many runs as there are factors, and avoid confounding of any pair of second-order effects. For designs having six factors or more, these designs project to efficient response surface designs with three or fewer factors. A limitation of these designs is that all factors must be quantitative. In this paper, we develop column-augmented DSDs that can accommodate any number of two-level qualitative factors using two methods. The DSD-augment method provides highly efficient designs that are still definitive in the sense that the estimates of all main effects continue to be unbiased by any active second-order effects. An alternative procedure, the ORTH-augment approach, leads to designs that are orthogonal linear main effects plans; however, some partial aliasing between main effects and interactions involving the categorical factors is present.","Alias,Conference Matrix,Confounding,Coordinate Exchange Algorithm,D-Efficiency,Robust Designs,Screening Designs","ORTHOGONAL ARRAYS,MIXED LEVELS,SMALL RUNS,ALGORITHM","Jones, Bradley@SAS Inst, Cary, NC 27513 USA::Nachtsheim, Christopher J.@Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Supply Chain & Operat Dept, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Jones, Bradley@Unknow::Nachtsheim, Christopher J.@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities",not exist,"2K-P FRACTIONAL FACTORIAL DESIGNS .2.+BOX, GEP; HUNTER, JS+TECHNOMETRICS+1961::no title+Hedayat, A.

Spatial Control Charts for the Mean,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2013,34,4,"Developments in metrology provide the opportunity to improve process monitoring by obtaining many measurements on each sampled unit. Increasing the number of measurements may increase the sensitivity of control charts to detection of flaws in local regions; however, the correlation between spatially proximal measurements may introduce redundancy and inefficiency in the test. This paper extends multivariate statistical process control to spatial-data monitoring by recognizing the spatial correlation between multiple measurements on the same item and replacing the sample covariance matrix with a parameterized covariance based on the semivariogram. The properties of this control chart for the mean of a spatial process are explored with simulated data and the method is illustrated with an example using ultrasonic technology to obtain nondestructive measurements of bottle thickness.","Hotelling T-2 Control Chart,Multivariate EWMA,Optimal Allocation of Sample Resources,Semivariogram,Spatial Covariance Models","NONLINEAR PROFILES,REGRESSION METHODS,MIXED MODELS","Grimshaw, Scott D.@Brigham Young Univ, Dept Stat, Provo, UT 84602 USA::Blades, Natalie J.@Brigham Young Univ, Dept Stat, Provo, UT 84602 USA::Miles, Michael P.@Brigham Young Univ, Dept Mfg Engn Technol, Provo, UT 84602 USA","Grimshaw, Scott D.@Brigham Young University::Blades, Natalie J.@Brigham Young University::Miles, Michael P.@Brigham Young University",not exist,"Hello World: Introducing Spatial Data+Bivand, Roger S.; Pebesma, Edzer J.; Gomez-Rubio, Virgilio+APPLIED SPATIAL DATA ANALYSIS WITH R+2008::Properties of the T-2 control chart when parameters are estimated+Champ, CW; Jones-Farmer, LA; Rigdon, SE+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 2005::Infill asymptotics for a stochastic process model with measurement error+Chen, HS; Simpson, DG; Ying, ZL+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 2000::Statistical Process Monitoring of Nonlinear Profiles Using Wavelets+Chicken, Eric; Pignatiello, Joseph, Jr.; Simpson, James R.+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 2009::Statistical process control for geometric specifications: On the monitoring of roundness profiles+Colosimo, Bianca M.; Semeraro, Quirico; Pacella, Massimo+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2008::Quality Control of Manufactured Surfaces+Colosimo, Bianca Maria; Mammarella, Federica; Petro, Stefano+FRONTIERS IN STATISTICAL QUALITY CONTROL 9+2010::no title+Cressie, N.+Statistics for Spatial Data+1993::Point process methodology for on-line spatio-temporal disease surveillance+Diggle, P; Rowlingson, B; Su, TL+ENVIRONMETRICS+AUG 2005::Model-based Geostatistics+Diggle, PJ; Ribeiro, PJ+MODEL-BASED GEOSTATISTICS+2007::Phase I analysis for monitoring nonlinear profiles in manufacturing processes+Ding, Yu; Zeng, Li; Zhou, Shiyu+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 2006::Profile Monitoring via Nonlinear Mixed Models+Jensen, Willis A.; Birch, Jeffrey B.+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2009::Monitoring correlation within linear profiles using mixed models+Jensen, Willis A.; Birch, Jeffrey B.; Woodall, William H.+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 2008::Effects of parameter estimation on control chart properties: A literature review+Jensen, Willis A.; Jones-Farmer, L.

Optimal Blocking for General Resolution-3 Designs,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2013,23,4,"This paper presents a general method for finding optimal blocking arrangements of pure-level and mixed-level orthogonal designs of resolution 3. The method requires enumeration of all nonisomorphic 'full designs' that include the treatment factors as well as the blocking factor. For all these designs, generalized word counts expressing the aliasing between main effects and two-factor interactions as well as the aliasing among two-factor interactions are calculated.

Gaining Physical Insights from Degradation Data,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2013,8,3,"Problem: The current study was motivated by the need to identify and explore the mechanisms leading to performance degradation and the ultimate failure of a newly designed battery to be used as a backup source for uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) applications. It was also desired to estimate how long (in terms of number of discharge cycles) the battery could serve its intended function before failing to sustain a discharge cycle for the required duration during a power outage.

Approach: An accelerated test (AT) was undertaken to investigate battery performance and degradation under elevated power, temperature, and cycling rate. The AT resulted in both lifetime and degradation data on test batteries. Standard maximum likelihood methods for censored data were used for lifetime analysis and modeling. In addition, a nonlinear mixed-effects model was developed to study the effects of acceleration variables on degradation.

Results: The lifetime-data analysis of the data from the AT provided good life estimates because the resulting data involved little censoring. Nevertheless, the further careful study of the degradation data provided valuable added knowledge by suggesting some underlying physical mechanisms and yielding insights that helped product-reliability improvement. It is generally recognized that degradation measurements provide more information than lifetime data. This holds particularly when there are only a few observed failures and the data are heavily censored. This case study illustrates another important benefit of degradation data even when lifetime data are nearly complete. Such data allow modeling of physical failure mechanisms more directly than lifetime data and, therefore, yields insights not possible through traditional lifetime analysis.","Arrhenius Relationship,Battery Testing,Censored Data,Failure Mechanism,Log-Normal Distribution,Nonlinear Mixed-Effects Models,Power Law,Weibull Distribution",MODEL,"Doganaksoy, Necip@GE Global Res, Software Sci & Analyt, Niskayuna, NY 12309 USA::Hall, David B.@GE Global Res, Energy Storage & Convers Mat, Niskayuna, NY 12309 USA","Doganaksoy, Necip@General Electric::Hall, David B.@General Electric",not exist,"A nonlinear random-coefficients model for degradation testing+Bae, SJ; Kvam, PH+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 2004::A review of accelerated test models+Escobar, Luis A.; Meeker, William Q.+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+NOV 2006::Degradation model analysis of laser diodes+Haeusler, K.; Zeimer, U.; Sumpf, B.; et al.+JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS+DEC 2008::A comparison of degradation and failure-time analysis methods for estimating a time-to-failure distribution+Lu, CJ; Meeker, WQ; Escobar, LA+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 1996::no title+Meeker, W.Q; Escobar, L.A.+Statistical Methods for Reliability Data+1998::Accelerated degradation tests: Modeling and analysis+Meeker, WQ; Escobar, LA; Lu, JC+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 1998::no title+Nelson, W.+Accelerated testing: statistical models, test plans, and data analyses+1990::no title+Pinheiro, J.; Bates, D.+Mixed-effects models in S and S-PLUS+2000"
A Multivariate Sign Chart for Monitoring Process Shape Parameters,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2013,50,12,"This paper develops a new multivariate nonparametric statistical process control (SPC) control chart for monitoring shape parameters, which is based on integrating a powerful multivariate spatial-sign test and exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control scheme to on-line sequential monitoring. It has a strictly distribution-free property over a broad class of population models, which implies the in-control run-length distribution can attain or is always very close to the nominal one when using the same control limit designed for the multivariate normal distribution. This proposed control chart possesses some other positive features: its computation speed is fast with a similar computation effort to the parametric multivariate EWMA (MEWMA) counterpart; it is easy to implement because only the multivariate median and the associated transformation matrix need to be estimated from the historical data before monitoring; it is efficient in detecting small or moderate shifts, when the process distribution is heavy tailed or skewed; it is also able to handle the case when the sample size is one and is effective in downward shifts. Simulation comparisons and a real-data example from a white-wine production process show that it performs quite well in applications.","Distribution-Free,Multivariate Covariance Matrix,Non parametric Procedure,Robustness,Statistical Process Control","STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,EWMA CONTROL CHART,AVERAGE CONTROL CHART,CHANGE-POINT MODEL,COVARIANCE-MATRIX,INDIVIDUAL OBSERVATIONS,PROCESS VARIABILITY,MEAN VECTOR,UNIVARIATE PROCESSES,TESTS","Li, Zhonghua@Nankai Univ, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China::Zou, Changliang@Nankai Univ, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China::Wang, Zhaojun@Nankai Univ, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China::Huwang, Longcheen@Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Hsinchu, Taiwan","Li, Zhonghua@Nankai University::Zou, Changliang@Nankai University::Wang, Zhaojun@Nankai University::Huwang, Longcheen@National Tsing Hua University",not exist,"Multivariate statistical process control charts: An overview+Bersimis, S.; Psarakis, S.; Panaretos, J.+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+AUG 2007::Nonparametric control charts: An overview and some results+Chakraborti, S; Van der Laan, P; Bakir, ST+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 2001::A new multivariate control chart for monitoring both location and dispersion+Chen, GM; Cheng, SW; Xie, HS+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+2005::Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties+Cortez, Paulo; Cerdeira, Antonio; Almeida, Fernando; et al.+DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS+NOV 2009::Multivariate Generations of Cumulative Sum Quality Control Schemes+CROSIER, R.

Integrating Analytical Models with Finite-Element Models: An Application in Micromachining,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2013,31,1,"Problem: The prediction of cutting forces is very important in designing mechanical micromachining to ensure geometrical accuracy of the machined feature and avoid tool breakage. These predictions can be done either via analytical models or finite-element models. The finite-element models are precise but usually time consuming to run. Analytical models, on the other hand, are less accurate but computationally much cheaper. The problem here is to integrate these two types of physics-based models and obtain an easy-to-evaluate statistical model that can approximate the machining forces.

Approach: We propose performing a sensitivity analysis using the computationally cheap analytical models prior to conducting the computationally intensive finite-element simulations. With the elicited prior knowledge from the sensitivity analysis, a two-stage strategy is presented for designing the finite-element simulations in which customized number of levels can be assigned for each input factor. The finite-element simulation data can then be integrated with the analytical models in developing the final metamodel.

Results: We show that the initial sensitivity analysis can reveal critical information about the underlying system and guide us to more efficiently extract information from the finite-element models. The proposed design for the finite-element simulations is comprised of two subarrays and overall can achieve desirable orthogonality and space-filling properties. Compared with using n different levels for all input factors, as in the traditional space-filling design, the new design is more capable for estimating factor interactions while still maintaining the ability to capture necessary nonlinear effects. By using fewer levels, it can also improve the efficiency of estimating the effects when the simulation is subject to stochastic noise. In model validation, our numerical results indicate that the fitted integrated metamodel can more precisely approximate the machining forces than either using the analytical models or the traditional metamodel based on the finite-element simulations alone.","Computer Experiment,Engineering Model,Gaussian Process Model,Metamodel,Sensitivity Analysis,Two-Stage Design","SPACE-FILLING DESIGNS,COMPUTER CODE,FACTORIALS,ACCURACY,OUTPUT,STEEL","Ba, Shan@Portland State Univ, Fariborz Maseeh Dept Math & Stat, Portland, OR 97201 USA::Jain, Nikhil@Indian Inst Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Bombay 400076, Maharashtra, India::Joseph, V.

For this scenario, the split-split-plot design is a well-known alternative design option. However, we prefer the more statistically efficient strip-plot designs and, therefore, we construct D-optimal strip-plot designs for three-stage processes with no randomization restriction in the third stage.

The Design of GLR Control Charts for Monitoring the Process Mean and Variance,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2013,48,6,"This paper investigates generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) control charts for the problem of monitoring the mean and variance of a normally distributed process variable when the objective is to effectively detect both small and large shifts in these parameters. It is shown that the GLR charts are generally as effective at detecting a wide range of shift sizes as other options, such as the traditional practice of using a combination of a control chart for the mean and a control chart for the variance. Using a combination of control charts requires that multiple control-chart design parameters be specified. Although multiple design parameters allow for the charts to be tuned to be more sensitive to certain shifts that may be of particular interest, they complicate the process of designing these charts. The GLR chart for detecting a change in the mean or an increase in the variance does not have any control-chart parameters that need to be specified other than the control limit. The GLR chart for the case in which decreases in the variance are also of interest has one design parameter in addition to the control limit.

Conjoint Analysis and Discrete Choice Experiments for Quality Improvement,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2013,53,6,"Conjoint analysis and discrete choice experiments, which were developed in fields such as marketing and economics, are useful for understanding the voice of the customer to guide quality-improvement efforts. Unfortunately, these methods have received relatively little attention in the quality area. In this article, we provide some guidelines for the use of conjoint analysis and discrete choice experiments. We discuss what they are, why they are useful methodologies for quality improvement, and how a discrete choice experiment can be carried out. We demonstrate the methodology by discussing a real case study in quality improvement in detail. We then introduce a new class of designs for discrete choice experiments that are robust for a class of possible models. We provide several examples in which an optimal design based on the main-effects only models is shown to have limited capability for estimation of two-factor interactions, whereas the proposed robust designs perform well in the presence of two-factor interactions. We conclude with a summary of key points and directions for future research.","Bayesian Design,Market Segmentation,Model Robust Design,Multinomial Logit,Nonlinear Design,Quality Function Deployment","OPTIMAL DESIGNS,MODEL-ROBUST,FUNCTION DEPLOYMENT,ALGORITHM,UNCERTAINTY,COMPUTATION,INTEGRATION","Li, William@Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Supply Chain & Operat Dept, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA::Nachtsheim, Christopher J.@Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Supply Chain & Operat Dept, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA::Wang, Ke@Fudan Univ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China::Reul, Robert@Isometr Solut, St Paul, MN 55125 USA::Albrecht, Mark@Natl Marrow Donor Program, Minneapolis, MN 55413 USA","Li, William@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities::Nachtsheim, Christopher J.@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities::Wang, Ke@Fudan University::Reul, Robert@Unknow::Albrecht, Mark@National Marrow Donor Program",not exist,"Screening designs for model discrimination+Agboto, Vincent; Li, William; Nachtsheim, Christopher+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+MAR 2010::New product development and quality assurance deployment system+Akao, Y.+Standardisation and Quality Control+1972::no title+AKAO Y+T 3 INT S QUAL FUNCT+1997::no title+ALBRECHT, M.; LI, W.; NACHTSHEIM, C.

A GLR Control Chart for Monitoring the Mean Vector of a Multivariate Normal Process,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2013,24,11,"This paper develops a statistical process control (SPC) chart based on a generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) statistic to monitor the mean vector of a multivariate normal process. The performance of the GLR chart is compared with the performance of the Hotelling chi(2) chart, the multivariate exponentially weighted moving average (MEWMA) chart, and a multi-MEWMA combination. Results show that the Hotelling chi(2) chart and the MEWMA chart are only effective for a small range of shift sizes in the mean vector, while the GLR chart and some carefully designed multi-MEWMA combinations can give similarly better overall performance in detecting a wide range of shift magnitudes. Unlike most of these other options, the GLR chart does not require specification of tuning-parameter values by the user. The GLR chart also has the advantage in process diagnostics: at the time of a signal, estimates of change-point and out-of-control mean vector are immediately available to the user. All these advantages of the GLR chart make it a favorable option for practitioners. For the design of the GLR chart, a series of easy-to-use equations are provided to users for calculating the control limit to achieve a desired in-control performance.","Change Point,Generalized Likelihood Ratio,Multivariate Control Chart,Multivariate CUSUM,Multivariate EWMA,Statistical Process Control,Surveillance","STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,COVARIANCE-MATRIX,QUALITY-CONTROL,SYSTEMS","Wang, Sai@Capital One Financial Corp, Mclean, VA 22102 USA::Reynolds, Marion R., Jr.@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Forest Resources & Environm Conservat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Wang, Sai@Unknow::Reynolds, Marion R., Jr.@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University",not exist,"The GLRT for statistical process control of autocorrelated processes+Apley, DW; Shi, J+IIE TRANSACTIONS+SEP 1999::no title+Basseville, M; Nikiforov, I.+Detection of Abrupt Changes: Theory and Applications+1993::Multivariate statistical process control charts: An overview+Bersimis, S.; Psarakis, S.; Panaretos, J.+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+AUG 2007::MULTIVARIATE GENERALIZATIONS OF CUMULATIVE SUM QUALITY-CONTROL SCHEMES+CROSIER, RB+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 1988::A NOTE ON MULTIVARIATE CUSUM PROCEDURES+HEALY, JD+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1987::Multivariate quality control+Hotelling, H.+Techniques of statistical analysis+1947::A Binomial GLR Control Chart for Monitoring a Proportion+Huang, Wandi; Reynolds, Marion R., Jr.; Wang, Sai+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 2012::A Generalized Likelihood Ratio Chart for Monitoring Bernoulli Processes+Huang, Wandi; Wang, Sai; Reynolds, Marion R., Jr.+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+JUL 2013::Information bounds and quick detection of parameter changes in stochastic systems+Lai, TL+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY+NOV 1998::SEQUENTIAL CHANGEPOINT DETECTION IN QUALITY-CONTROL AND DYNAMICAL-SYSTEMS+LAI, TL+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1995::Sequential analysis: Some classical problems and new challenges+Lai, TL+STATISTICA SINICA+APR 2001::A REVIEW OF MULTIVARIATE CONTROL CHARTS+LOWRY, CA; MONTGOMERY, DC+IIE TRANSACTIONS+DEC 1995::A MULTIVARIATE EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE CONTROL CHART+LOWRY, CA; WOODALL, WH; CHAMP, CW; et al.+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1992::STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL OF MULTIVARIATE PROCESSES+MACGREGOR, JF; KOURTI, T+CONTROL ENGINEERING PRACTICE+MAR 1995::no title+Montgomery, D.

Supersaturated Split-Plot Designs,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2013,45,1,"Methods to construct supersaturated split-plot designs (SSSPDs) are presented. We use an E(s(2))-optimal supersaturated design (SSD) in the whole-plot and half fractions of Plackett-Burman designs (PBDs) in the split plot. It is shown that (1) the resulting split-plot design has orthogonal columns, (2) the split-plot columns are orthogonal to the whole-plot columns, and (3) the whole-plot columns are orthogonal to the whole-plot by split-plot interactions. As an example, an SSSPD is applied to an extrusion process to produce biodegradable packaging foams, and data are analyzed using stepwise selection procedures. It is concluded that SSSPD can be used productively as a screening design when the experiment has a split-plot structure and traditional designs are not feasible.","Plackett-Burman Designs,Split-plot Designs,Stepwise,Supersaturated Designs","STARCH ACETATE,CONSTRUCTION,FIBERS,FOAMS,EXPANSION","Koh, Woon Yuen@Univ New England, Dept Math Sci, Biddeford, ME 04005 USA::Eskridge, Kent M.@Univ Nebraska, Dept Statistics, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA::Hanna, Milford A.@Univ Nebraska, Dept Biol Syst Engn, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA","Koh, Woon Yuen@University of New England - USA::Eskridge, Kent M.@University of Nebraska Lincoln@University of Nebraska System::Hanna, Milford A.@University of Nebraska Lincoln@University of Nebraska System",not exist,"Some risks in the construction and analysis of supersaturated designs+Abraham, B; Chipman, H; Vijayan, K+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 1999::Plasticized Starch-Cellulose Interactions in Polysaccharide Composites+AVEROUS, L.; FRINGANT, C.; MORO, L.+Polymer+2001::Starch-based biodegradable materials suitable for thermoforming packaging+Averous, L; Fringant, C; Moro, L+STARCH-STARKE+AUG 2001::A two-stage Bayesian model selection strategy for supersaturated designs+Beattie, SD; Fong, DKH; Lin, DKJ+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 2002::Minimum-aberration two-level fractional factorial split-plot designs+Bingham, D; Sitter, RR+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1999::Design issues in fractional factorial split-plot experiments+Bingham, DR; Sitter, RR+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2001::The design and analysis of 2(k-p) x 2(q-r) split plot experiments+Bisgaard, S+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2000::SOME SYSTEMATIC SUPERSATURATED DESIGNS+BOOTH, KHV; COX, DR+TECHNOMETRICS+1962::AN ANALYSIS FOR UNREPLICATED FRACTIONAL FACTORIALS+BOX, GEP; MEYER, RD+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1986::A general method of constructing E(s(2))-optimal supersaturated designs+Butler, NA; Mead, R; Eskridge, KM; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2001::Size exclusion chromatography characterization of thermoplastic starch composites 1.

A Superposed Log-Linear Failure Intensity Model for Repairable Artillery Systems,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2013,22,3,"This article investigates complex repairable artillery systems that include several failure modes. We derive a superposed process based on a mixture of nonhomogeneous Poisson processes in a minimal repair model. This allows for a bathtub-shaped failure intensity that models artillery data better than currently used methods. The method of maximum likelihood is used to estimate model parameters and construct confidence intervals for the cumulative intensity of the superposed process. Finally, we propose an optimal maintenance policy for repairable systems with bathtub-shaped intensity and apply it to the artillery-failure data.","Maximum Likelihood, Minimal Repair,Nonhomogeneous Poisson Process,Optimal Preventive Maintenance,Proportional Age-Reduction Model,Superposed Process","RELIABILITY-ANALYSIS,MAINTENANCE,EQUIPMENT,INFERENCE,RATES","Mun, Byeong Min@Hanyang Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Seoul 133791, South Korea::Bae, Suk Joo@Hanyang Univ, Dept Technol Management, Seoul 133791, South Korea@Hanyang Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Seoul 133791, South Korea::Kvam, Paul H.@Georgia Inst Technol, H Milton Stewart Sch Ind & Syst Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Mun, Byeong Min@Hanyang University::Bae, Suk Joo@Hanyang University::Kvam, Paul H.@Georgia Institute of Technology@University System of Georgia","bae, suk joo@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9938-7406","Bayesian Inference for the Piecewise Exponential Model for the Reliability of Multiple Repairable Systems+Arab, Ali; Rigdon, Steven E.; Basu, Asit P.+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2012::no title+Ascher, H; Feingold, H.+Repairable systems reliability+1984::no title+BARLOW RE+NUCL SYSTEMS RELIABI+1977::Statistical inference for a modulated power law process+Black, SE; Rigdon, SE+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 1996::MODELING REPAIRABLE SYSTEMS WITH FAILURE RATES THAT DEPEND ON AGE AND MAINTENANCE+CHAN, JK; SHAW, L+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY+DEC 1993::no title+Cox, D.

Adaptive Generalized Likelihood Ratio Control Charts for Detecting Unknown Patterned Mean Shifts,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2012,50,9,"Traditional statistical control schemes have been mainly focused on detecting constant mean shifts. In many practical applications, however, the mean of the observed sequence can exhibit a time-varying behavior after the fault occurrence. Shewhart control charts supplemented with sensitizing run rules have been suggested for detecting nonrandom dynamic mean patterns. However, the choice of a particular set of run rules requires some prior knowledge of the possible expected patterns. In addition, the resulting schemes can have poor performance against small shifts. When the mean shift pattern is known in advance, generalized likelihood ratio (GLR), cumulative score (CUSCORE), and optimal general linear filter (OGLF) control charts have also been proposed for change-point detection. Further, some adaptive CUSCORE schemes have been recently developed for detecting an unknown patterned mean shift. However, these adaptive CUSCOREs assume the occurrence of one-sided mean shifts. Hence, their performance may be poor in the case of an oscillatory behavior of the process mean. To overcome these limitations, we propose estimating a possible pattern in the mean using an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA), which is especially effective with one-sided shifts in the mean, combined with a wavelet smoother, which is effective in estimating oscillatory mean patterns. The two estimates then drive two separate conventional GLR tests for significance. A control chart is proposed for observations from normal distributions and then extended to a completely distribution-free setting. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed charts with a wide variety of patterned mean shifts in both the independent and autocorrelated scenarios and with a wide variety of distributions. In addition, the proposed scheme provides post-signal diagnostic information that estimates the change-point location and the shift pattern of the mean. An R package is available online as supplementary material.","Control Charts,Dynamic Shifts,Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test,Nonparametric,Post-Signal Diagnostic,Statistical Process Control,Wavelet Smoothing","STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,SUPPLEMENTARY RUNS RULES,SHEWHART CONTROL CHARTS,QUALITY-CONTROL,CONTROL SCHEMES,CHANGE-POINT,DESIGN,CUSCORE,CUSUM,SYSTEMS","Capizzi, Giovanna@Univ Padua, Dept Stat Sci, I-35121 Padua, Italy::Masarotto, Guido@Univ Padua, Dept Stat Sci, I-35121 Padua, Italy","Capizzi, Giovanna@University of Padua::Masarotto, Guido@University of Padua",not exist,"An optimal filter design approach to statistical process control+Apley, Daniel W.; Chin, Chang-Ho+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 2007::The GLRT for statistical process control of autocorrelated processes+Apley, DW; Shi, J+IIE TRANSACTIONS+SEP 1999::no title+Basseville, M.; Nikiforov, I.

A Bayesian Approach to the Analysis of Split-Plot Combined and Product Arrays and Optimization in Robust Parameter Design,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2012,30,2,"Many robust parameter design (RPD) studies involve a split-plot randomization structure and it is essential to account for the induced correlation structure to obtain valid inferences in the analysis. Bayesian methods are appealing for these studies because they naturally accommodate a general class of models, can account for parameter uncertainty in process optimization, and offer the necessary flexibility when one is interested in nonstandard performance criteria, e.g., the probability that a new response exceeds some threshold value. In this paper, we present a Bayesian approach to process optimization for a general class of RPD models, including both normal and non-normal responses, in the split-plot context using an empirical approximation of the posterior distribution for an objective function of interest. Two examples from the literature, one involving a crossed array and the other a combined array, are used for illustration.","Bayesian Predictive Density,Generalized Linear Mixed Models,Hard-to-Change Factor,Markov Chain Monte Carlo,Process Optimization,Response Surface,Restricted Randomization","NONNORMAL RESPONSES,MODEL,UNCERTAINTY","Robinson, Timothy J.@Univ Wyoming, Dept Stat, Laramie, WY 82071 USA::Pintar, Adam L.@NIST, Stat Engn Div, Informat Technol Lab, Gaithersburg, MD 20899 USA::Anderson-Cook, Christine M.@Los Alamos Natl Lab, Stat Sci Grp, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA::Hamada, Michael S.@Los Alamos Natl Lab, Stat Sci Grp, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA","Robinson, Timothy J.@University of Wyoming::Pintar, Adam L.@National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) - USA::Anderson-Cook, Christine M.@Los Alamos National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)::Hamada, Michael S.@Los Alamos National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)",not exist,"A Bayesian Plotting Method for Fractional Factorial Data Analysis+Allen, Theodore T.; Rajagopalan, Ravishankar+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 2011::A cautious approach to robust design with model parameter uncertainty+Apley, Daniel W.; Kim, Jeongbae+IIE TRANSACTIONS+2011::Split-plot designs for robust product experimentation+Box, G.

An Algorithm for Finding D-Efficient Equivalent-Estimation Second-Order Split-Plot Designs,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2012,29,9,"Many industrial experiments involve restricted rather than complete randomization. This often leads to the use of split-plot designs, which limit the number of independent settings of some of the experimental factors. These factors, named whole-plot factors, are often, in some way, hard to change. The remaining factors, called subplot factors, are easier to change. Their levels are therefore independently reset for every run of the experiment. In general, model estimation from data from split-plot experiments requires the use of generalized least squares (GLS). However, for some split-plot designs, the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator will produce the same factor-effect estimates as the GLS estimator. These designs are called equivalent-estimation split-plot designs and offer the advantage that estimation of the factor effects does not require estimation of the variance components in the split-plot model. While many of the equivalent-estimation second-order response-surface designs presented in the literature do not perform well in terms of estimation efficiency (as measured by the D-optimality criterion), Macharia and Goos (2010) showed that, in many instances, it is possible to generate second-order equivalent-estimation split-plot designs that are highly efficient and, hence, provide precise factor-effect estimates. In this work, we present an algorithm that allows us to (i) identify equivalent-estimation designs for scenarios where Macharia and Goos (2010) did not find equivalent-estimation designs and (ii) find equivalent-estimation designs that outperform those of Macharia and Goos (2010) in terms of the D-optimality criterion. We also study the performance of equivalent-estimation designs when it comes to estimating the variance components in the split-plot model and observe that they outperform D-optimal designs in this respect.","Coordinate-Exchange Algorithm,D-Optimality,Equivalent Estimation,Generalized Least Squares,Ordinary Least Squares,Restricted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (REML),Split-Plot Design","RESPONSE-SURFACE DESIGNS,INFERENCE,SIZES","Jones, Bradley@SAS Inst, Cary, NC 27513 USA@Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium@Univ Antwerp, StatUa Ctr Stat, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium::Goos, Peter@Univ Antwerp, StatUa Ctr Stat, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium@Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium@Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands","Jones, Bradley@University of Antwerp::Goos, Peter@University of Antwerp@Erasmus University Rotterdam",not exist,"Checking the Adequacy of Fit of Models from Split-Plot Designs+Almini, Ashraf A.; Kulahci, Murat; Montgomery, Douglas C.+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 2009::Minimum-aberration two-level fractional factorial split-plot designs+Bingham, D; Sitter, RR+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1999::Designing fractional factorial split-plot experiments with few whole-plot factors+Bingham, DR; Schoen, ED; Sitter, RR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2004::no title+Brent, R.

T-2 Control Charts with Variable Dimension,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2012,33,7,"This paper proposes a new multivariate T-2 control chart, termed the variable dimension T-2 (VDT2) chart, in which the number of monitored quality characteristics is variable. When there are p related variables to be monitored, the approach is useful if there is a subset of p(1) variables that are easy and/or inexpensive to measure, while the remaining variables are difficult and/or expensive to measure but provide additional useful information on whether the process mean has shifted. The VDT2 chart adaptively determines the number of variables to be monitored (either p(1) or p) depending on the last value of the charted statistic. We provide Windows (R)-based software to optimize the parameters of the control chart using a Markov chain model to compute the performance measures and a genetic algorithm to conduct the optimization. The optimized VDT2 chart is quite powerful, and we demonstrate the somewhat surprising result that it detects mean shifts faster than a standard T-2 chart for which all p variables are always measured, while also reducing sampling costs.","Adaptive Control,Dimension,Multivariate,Optimization,Statistical-Process Control","STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,ADAPTIVE-CONTROL CHARTS,PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS,SAMPLING INTERVALS,(X)OVER-BAR CHARTS,CONTROL SCHEMES,SIZES,PARAMETERS,ATTRIBUTES,DESIGN","Aparisi, Francisco@Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Estadist & Invest Operat Aplicadas & Calidad, E-46071 Valencia, Spain::Epprecht, Eugenio K.@Pontificia Univ Catolica Rio de Janeiro, Dept Ind Engn, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil::Ruiz, Omar@Escuela Super Politecn Litoral, Inst Ciencias Matemat, Guayaquil, Ecuador","Aparisi, Francisco@Universitat Politecnica de Valencia::Epprecht, Eugenio K.@Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro::Ruiz, Omar@Escuela Superior Politecnica del Litoral",not exist,"Hotelling's T-2 control chart with adaptive sample sizes+Aparisi, F+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH+OCT 1996::Optimisation of a set of [image omitted] or principal components control charts using genetic algorithms+Aparisi, Francisco; de Luna, Marco A.; Epprecht, Eugenio+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH+2010::Multivariate statistical process control charts: An overview+Bersimis, S.; Psarakis, S.; Panaretos, J.+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+AUG 2007::Double sampling hotelling's T-2 charts+Champ, Charles W.; Aparisi, Francisco+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+MAR 2008::Joint (X)over-bar and R charts with variable parameters+Costa, AFB+IIE TRANSACTIONS+JUN 1998::Economic design of two-stage (X)over-bar charts: The Markov chain approach+Costa, AFB; De Magalhaes, MS+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS+JAN 28 2005::(X)over-bar charts with variable parameters+Costa, AFB+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 1999::(X)over-bar chart with variable sample size and sampling intervals+Costa, AFB+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 1997::(X)OVER-BAR CHARTS WITH VARIABLE SAMPLE-SIZE+COSTA, AFB+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1994::A NEW 2-SIDED CUMULATIVE SUM QUALITY-CONTROL SCHEME+CROSIER, RB+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 1986::Adaptive control charts for attributes+Epprecht, EK; Costa, AFB; Mendes, FCT+IIE TRANSACTIONS+JUN 2003::A variable sampling interval EWMA chart for attributes+Epprecht, Eugenio K.; Simoes, Bruno F.

Maximum-Likelihood-Based Diagnostics after a Signal from Control Charts,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2012,37,2,"When a control chart or combination of charts signals that there has been a change in the mean or variance of the process being monitored, there is usually no direct indication of when the change occurred, which parameter changed, or how much the parameter, changed. Knowing the change point, which parameter changed, and the change size helps identify the cause of the change so that appropriate corrective action can be taken. This paper evaluates diagnostic procedures based on obtaining maximum-likelihood estimates of the change point and current process parameters, and then obtaining confidence intervals that can be used to identify the changed parameters. The performance of these diagnostic procedures is illustrated for two cases, one in which the sample size is n = 4 or n = 1 and an EWMA chart combination is used for process monitoring, and another in which the sample size is n = 1 and the Shewhart X and moving-range chart combination is being used. It is shown that the diagnostic procedures work well in most cases. Thus, the procedures should be very useful in situations in which traditional diagnostic procedures cannot be used or do not provide complete diagnostic information.","Change Point,Confidence Interval,Diagnostic Procedure,EWMA,Maximum-Likelihood Estimates,Process Monitoring,Shewhart Chart,Squared Deviations from Target,Statistical Process Control,Surveillance","CHANGE-POINT,PARAMETER,VARIANCE,SYSTEMS,SPC,DISTURBANCE,MODEL","Lou, Jianying@Medpace, Cincinnati, OH 45212 USA::Reynolds, Marion R., Jr.@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Forest Resources & Environm Conservat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Lou, Jianying@Unknow::Reynolds, Marion R., Jr.@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University",not exist,"AN ANALYSIS OF TAGUCHI ONLINE PROCESS-CONTROL PROCEDURE UNDER A RANDOM-WALK MODEL+ADAMS, BM;

The Monitoring of Linear Profiles with a GLR Control Chart,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2012,34,12,"In this paper, we consider the problem of monitoring a linear functional relationship between a response variable and one or more explanatory variables (a linear profile). The design and application of a generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) control chart are discussed. The likelihood ratio test of the GLR chart is generalized over the regression coefficients, the variance of the error term, and the possible change point. The performance of the GLR chart is compared with various existing control charts. We show that the overall performance of the GLR chart is much better than other options in detecting a wide range of shift sizes. The existing control charts designed for certain shifts that may be of particular interest have several chart parameters that need to be specified by the user, which makes the design of such control charts more difficult. The GLR chart is very simple to design, as it is invariant to the choice of design matrix and the values of in-control parameters. Therefore, there is only one design parameter (the control limit) that needs to be specified. Another advantage of the GLR chart is its built-in diagnostic aids that provide estimates of both the change point and the values of linear profile parameters.","Average Time to Signal,Change Point,EWMA Chart,Generalized Likelihood Ratio,Linear Regression,Statistical Process Control,Surveillance","VARIABLE SAMPLING INTERVALS,POLYNOMIAL PROFILES,REGRESSION PROFILES,LIKELIHOOD RATIO,SYSTEMS,MODEL","Xu, Liaosa@Virginia Tech, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Wang, Sai@Unknow::Peng, Yiming@Virginia Tech, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Morgan, J.

Assessing a Binary Measurement System with Varying Misclassification Rates Using a Latent Class Random Effects Model,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2012,22,9,"When no gold standard measurement system is available, we can assess a binary measurement system by making repeated measurements on a random sample of parts and then using a latent class model for the analysis. However, there is widespread criticism of the model assumptions that, given the true state of the part, the repeated measurements are independent and have the same misclassification probability. We propose a latent class random effects model that relaxes these assumptions by modeling the distribution of the two misclassification rates with Beta distributions. We start by finding the likelihood, the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) and their approximate standard deviations with the standard assessment plan that selects parts at random from the process. However, to estimate the model parameters with reasonable precision, the standard plan requires extremely large sample sizes in the common industrial situation where the proportion of conforming parts is high and the misclassification probabilities are small. More realistic sample sizes are possible when we instead sample randomly from the population of previously failed parts and supplement the likelihood with baseline information on the overall pass rate. We show using simulation that, for feasible designs, the asymptotic standard deviation based on the expected information provides a reasonably close approximation to the simulated standard deviation. We then use these approximations to investigate how the properties of the MLEs for the unknown parameters depend on the baseline size, the number of parts in the sample, and the number of repeated measurements per part.","Beta Binomial,Binary Measurement Systems,Latent Class Model,Misclassification Rates,Random Effects","DIAGNOSTIC-TESTS,INSPECTION","Danila, Oana@Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada::Steiner, Stefan H.@Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada::MacKay, R.

Robust Leak Tests for Transmission Systems Using Nonlinear Mixed-Effect Models,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2012,15,3,"Problem: Leakage of the transmission fluid or oil in powertrain systems (i.e., transmissions, cylinder heads, engine blocks, etc.) can cause engine overheating and/or permanent damage. Therefore, it is crucial to run a leak test to inspect for any possible porosity in the casting parts. However, the inspection results for the amount of leakage at given testing times are sensitive to the tested part's temperature, which varies from part to part but was not previously incorporated in the leak testing systems. The objective of this paper is to develop a robust leak testing system that is insensitive to the part temperature variations in real production processes.

Approach: In the production line, a part is tested at a temperature that is generally not equal to the calibration temperature at which the inspection threshold for leakage was set. To achieve a robust leak test that is insensitive to temperature variation in the tested part, we propose a temperature compensation algorithm to adjust the measured leak flow, taking into account the tested part temperature and the calibration temperature. For this purpose, a nonlinear mixed-effect model is first developed for modeling the leak flow profile as a function of both the leak testing time and the part temperature. Then, the fitted mixed-effect model is used to adjust the leak flow based on the calibration temperature. If the amount of the adjusted leakage at the given inspection time exceeds the inspection threshold, the part is rejected; otherwise, the part is accepted.

Results: The proposed compensation algorithm is developed and validated using a set of training samples and another set of test samples, respectively. We use the percentage of error reduction in the leak flow measurements at different temperatures as the criterion to validate the developed compensation algorithm. The results show that the average percentage of error reduction for the test samples is about 92%. This indicates a significant improvement in the leak testing results.","Control Charts,Nonlinear Profiles,Parametric Nonlinear Regression,Powertrain Manufacturing,Random Effects","MANUFACTURING PROCESSES,PROFILES,SIGNALS","Paynabar, Kamran@Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA::Jin, Jionghua (Judy)@Univ Michigan, Dept Ind & Operat Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA::Agapiou, John@Gen Motors R&D, Warren, MI 48090 USA::Deeds, Paula@Gen Motor Powertrain, Pontiac, MI 48340 USA","Paynabar, Kamran@Georgia Institute of Technology@University System of Georgia::Jin, Jionghua (Judy)@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan::Agapiou, John@General Motors Company::Deeds, Paula@General Motors Company",not exist,"NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::no title+Davidian, M.; Giltinan, D.

A Binomial GLR Control Chart for Monitoring a Proportion,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2012,26,13,"This paper considers a control chart for monitoring a process proportion based on a generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) statistic. The objective is to effectively detect a wide range of shift sizes. The GLR statistic is obtained from a moving window of past sample statistics that follow a binomial distribution. The Phase II performance of this chart is evaluated using the steady state average number of observations to signal (SSANOS) for detecting sustained increases in the proportion. Comparisons of the binomial GLR chart to the Shewhart np-chart, the individual binomial cumulative sum (CUSUM) chart, and combinations of multiple binomial CUSUM charts show that the overall performance of the binomial GLR chart is at least as good as these other options. Moreover, unlike the other charts, the binomial GLR chart has an advantage that it does not require users to specify multiple charting parameters that may be difficult to obtain, and this makes it easier for the GLR chart to be designed for practical applications.","Binomial CUSUM Chart,Moving Window,Shewhart np-Chart,Statistical Process Control,Steady State Average Number of Observations to Signal,Subgroup,Surveillance","STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,QUALITY-CONTROL,CHANGE-POINT,CUSUM,SYSTEMS,DESIGN,SHIFTS","Huang, Wandi@Citicorp Credit Serv, Long Isl City, NY 11101 USA::Reynolds, Marion R., Jr.@Virginia Tech, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA@Virginia Tech, Dept Forest Resources & Environm Conservat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Wang, Sai@Capital One Financial Corp, Mclean, VA 22102 USA","Huang, Wandi@Unknow::Reynolds, Marion R., Jr.@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Wang, Sai@Unknow",not exist,"The GLRT for statistical process control of autocorrelated processes+Apley, DW; Shi, J+IIE TRANSACTIONS+SEP 1999::no title+Basseville, M; Nikiforov, I.+Detection of Abrupt Changes: Theory and Applications+1993::Design of change detection algorithms based on the generalized likelihood ratio test+Capizzi, G+ENVIRONMETRICS+DEC 2001::The design and analysis of 2-CUSUM procedure+Dragalin, V+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+1997::An Optimal Design of CUSUM Control Charts for Binomial Counts+Gan, F.

A Variable-Selection-Based Multivariate EWMA Chart for Process Monitoring and Diagnosis,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2012,34,28,"Fault detection and root cause identification are both important tasks in Multivariate Statistical Process Control (MSPC) for improving process and product quality. Most traditional control charts, including Hotelling's T-2 chart and the Multivariate Exponential Weighted Moving Average (MEWMA) chart, separate the two tasks into independent and successive procedures by signaling the existence of process faults followed by auxiliary methods to locate root causes. This paper proposes an integrated procedure, a Variable-Selection-based MEWMA (VS-MEWMA) chart, for multivariate process monitoring and fault diagnosis by utilizing dimensionality reduction techniques. The VS-MEWMA chart first locates potentially out-of-control variables via variable selection and then deploys such information in the monitoring statistics with the reduction in dimensionality providing increased sensitivity to out-of-control conditions. When a signal is given, the algorithm also identifies the suspected variables for further root cause diagnosis. Both numerical simulations and real examples are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed chart, as well as design guidelines.","Average Run Length,Fault Diagnosis,Forward Selection,MEWMA,Multivariate Statistical Process Control","STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,ADAPTIVE T-2 CHART,VARIATION PATTERNS,INDIVIDUAL OBSERVATIONS,PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS,QUALITY-CONTROL,IDENTIFICATION,FRAMEWORK,SCHEMES,LASSO","Jiang, Wei@Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai 200052, Peoples R China::Wang, Kaibo@Tsinghua Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China::Tsung, Fugee@Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Logist Management, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Jiang, Wei@Shanghai Jiao Tong University::Wang, Kaibo@Tsinghua University::Tsung, Fugee@Hong Kong University of Science & Technology","Wang, Kaibo@G-1640-2012","Simultaneous Identification of Premodeled and Unmodeled Variation Patterns+Apley, Daniel W.; Lee, Ho Young+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2010::Identifying spatial variation patterns in multivariate manufacturing processes: A blind separation approach+Apley, DW; Lee, HY+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 2003::FINDING THE ACTIVE FACTORS IN FRACTIONATED SCREENING EXPERIMENTS+BOX, GEP; MEYER, RD+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 1993::A Multivariate Robust Control Chart for Individual Observations+Chenouri, Shoja'eddin; Steiner, Stefan H.; Variyath, Asokan Mulayath+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 2009::Adaptive multivariate statistical process control for monitoring time-varying processes+Choi, SW; Martin, EB; Morris, AJ; et al.+INDUSTRIAL &amp; ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH+APR 26 2006::Distributed sensing for quality and productivity improvements+Ding, Yu; Elsayed, Elsayed A.; Kumara, Soundar; et al.+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING+OCT 2006::Identification of faulty sensors using principal component analysis+Dunia, R; Qin, SJ; Edgar, TF; et al.+AICHE JOURNAL+OCT 1996::A BAYES APPROACH TO A QUALITY CONTROL MODEL+GIRSHICK, MA; RUBIN, H+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1952::Principal alarms in multivariate statistical process control+Gonzalez, Isabel; Sanchez, Ismael+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2008::CUSUM and EWMA multi-charts for detecting a range of mean shifts+Han, Dong; Tsung, Fugee; Hu, Xijian; et al.+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 2007::REGRESSION ADJUSTMENT FOR VARIABLES IN MULTIVARIATE QUALITY-CONTROL+HAWKINS, DM+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1993::MULTIVARIATE QUALITY-CONTROL BASED ON REGRESSION-ADJUSTED VARIABLES+HAWKINS, DM+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1991::Multivariate exponentially weighted moving covariance matrix+Hawkins, Douglas M.; Maboudou-Tchao, Edgard M.+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 2008::Monitoring multivariate process variability for individual observations+Huwang, Longcheen; Yeh, Arthur B.; Wu, Chien-Wei+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 2007::A theoretical framework and efficiency study of multivariate statistical process control charts+Jiang, Wei; Tsui, Kwok-Leung+IIE TRANSACTIONS+2008::A statistical process control approach to business activity monitoring+Jiang, Wei; Au, Tom; Tsui, Kwok-Leung+IIE TRANSACTIONS+MAR 2007::EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE CONTROL SCHEMES - PROPERTIES AND ENHANCEMENTS+LUCAS, JM; SACCUCCI, MS+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1990::ASASIAM series on statistics and applied mathematics+Mason, R.

A Bayesian Approach to Change Point Estimation in Multivariate SPC,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2012,24,7,"A Bayesian procedure is developed to estimate the time of a change in the process mean vector for a multivariate process, given that an out-of-control signal was raised on a multivariate control chart. In addition, we can infer simultaneously which variable(s) had a change in mean value, when the change occurred, and the value of the changed mean. All three problems (inferring change point time, variables that shifted, and new values for the shifted variables) are addressed in a single statistical model. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, through the software WinBUGS, are used to estimate parameters of the change point models. To identify the mean shift in a process with more than two variables, we propose a branch-and-bound search algorithm so that MCMC can be carried out with a predictable computing time in each search step. A simulation study shows that the Bayesian approach has similar performance compared to the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) in terms of identifying the true change point location when a noninformative prior is assumed; however, it can perform better when proper prior knowledge is incorporated into the estimation procedure. The Bayesian approach provides full posterior distributions for the model and change point, which can contain information that is not available in a likelihood analysis.","Markov Chain Monte Carlo,MEWMA,Process Mean Shift Model,Search Algorithm","CONTROL CHART,MEAN VECTOR,INFERENCE,SEQUENCE,MODEL","Pan, Rong@Arizona State Univ, Sch Comp Informat & Decis Syst Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA::Rigdon, Steven E.@So Illinois Univ Edwardsville, Dept Math & Stat, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA","Pan, Rong@Arizona State University::Rigdon, Steven E.@Southern Illinois University System@Southern Illinois University Edwardsville",not exist,"Posterior Distribution Charts: A Bayesian Approach for Graphically Exploring a Process Mean+APLEY, D.

Several cumulative sum control charts are derived directly from the log-likelihood ratios for various types of shifts in the INARCH(1) model parameters. We define zero-state (worst-state) and steady-state average run length metrics and discuss their computation for the proposed charts. An extensive study indicates that these charts perform well in detecting changes in the process.

I-Optimal Versus D-Optimal Split-Plot Response Surface Designs,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2012,33,23,"Response surface experiments often involve only quantitative factors, and the response is fit using a full quadratic model in these factors. The term response surface implies that interest in these studies is more on prediction than parameter estimation because the points on the fitted surface are predicted responses. When computing optimal designs for response surface experiments, it therefore makes sense to focus attention on the predictive capability of the designs. However, the most popular criterion for creating optimal experimental designs is the D-optimality criterion, which aims to minimize the variance of the factor effect estimates in an omnibus sense. Because I-optimal designs minimize the average variance of prediction over the region of experimentation, their focus is clearly on prediction. Therefore, the I-optimality criterion seems to be a more appropriate one than the D-optimality criterion for generating response surface designs. Here we introduce I-optimal design of split-plot response surface experiments. We show through several examples that I-optimal split-plot designs provide substantial benefits in terms of improved prediction compared with D-optimal split-plot designs, while also performing very well in terms of the precision of the factor effect estimates.","Coordinate-Exchange Algorithm,D-Optimality,Hard-to-Change Factors,I-Optimality,IV-Optimality,Multistratum Design,Split-Plot Design,V-Optimality","EQUIVALENT-ESTIMATION,CONSTRUCTION,ALGORITHM,SIZES","Jones, Bradley@Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, Antwerp, Belgium::Goos, Peter@Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, Antwerp, Belgium@Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands","Jones, Bradley@University of Antwerp::Goos, Peter@University of Antwerp@Erasmus University Rotterdam",not exist,"Follow-up designs to resolve confounding in split-plot experiments+Almimi, Ashraf A.; Kulahci, Murat; Montgomery, Douglas C.+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 2008::Designing and running super-efficient experiments: Optimum blocking with one hard-to-change factor+Anbari, Frank T.; Lucas, James M.+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2008::Update formulas for split-plot and block designs+Arnouts, Heidi; Goos, Peter+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+DEC 1 2010::Minimum-aberration two-level fractional factorial split-plot designs+Bingham, D; Sitter, RR+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1999::Designing fractional factorial split-plot experiments with few whole-plot factors+Bingham, D.R.; Schoen, E.D.; Sitter, R.R.+Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series C+2004::Designing fractional factorial split-plot experiments with few whole-plot factors+Bingham, DR; Schoen, ED; Sitter, RR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2004::Outperforming completely randomized designs+Goos, P; Vandebroek, M+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2004::Optimal split-plot designs+Goos, P; Vandebroek, M+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 2001::D-optimal split-plot designs with given numbers and sizes of whole plots+Goos, P; Vandebroek, M+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 2003::no title+Goos, P.+The Optimal Design of Blocked and Split-Plot Experiments+2002::Optimal versus orthogonal and equivalent-estimation design of blocked and split-plot experiments+Goos, Peter+STATISTICA NEERLANDICA+AUG 2006::Untitled+Goos, Peter; Lucas, James M.+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 2009::no title+HAINES LM+TECHNOMETRICS+1987::no title+Hardin, R.

Two Nonparametric Control Charts for Detecting Arbitrary Distribution Changes,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2012,26,54,"Most traditional control charts used for sequential monitoring assume that full knowledge is available regarding the prechange distribution of the process. This assumption is unrealistic in many situations, where insufficient data are available to allow this distribution to be accurately estimated. This creates the need for nonparametric charts that do not assume any specific form for the process distribution, yet are able to maintain a specified level of performance regardless of its true nature. Although several nonparametric Phase II control charts have been developed, these are generally only able to detect changes in a location parameter, such as the mean or median, rather than more general changes. In this work, we present two distribution-free charts that can detect arbitrary changes to the process distribution during Phase II monitoring. Our charts are formed by integrating the omnibus Kolmogorov Smirnov and Cramer-von-Mises tests into the widely researched change-point model framework.","Change Detection,Nonparametric Tests,Phase II","CHANGE-POINT MODEL,EWMA CONTROL CHARTS,KOLMOGOROV-SMIRNOV,LIKELIHOOD RATIO,CRITERION,TESTS","Ross, Gordon J.@Univ Bristol, Dept Math, Bristol BS8 1TW, Avon, England::Adams, Niall M.@Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Math, London SW7 62AZ, England","Ross, Gordon J.@University of Bristol::Adams, Niall M.@Imperial College London",not exist,"A comparison of control charting procedures for monitoring process dispersion+Acosta-Mejia, CA; Pignatiello, JJ; Rao, BV+IIE TRANSACTIONS+JUN 1999::CUMIN charts+Albers, Willem; Kallenberg, Wilbert C.

In this paper, we present a Bayesian predictive modeling approach for functional response systems. The goal is to optimize the shape, or profile, of the functional response. A robust parameter design scenario is assumed where there are controllable factors and noise factors that vary randomly according to some distribution. The approach incorporates the uncertainty in the model parameters in the optimization phase, extending earlier approaches by J. Peterson (in the multivariate regression case) to the functional response case based on a hierarchical two-stage mixed-effects model. The method is illustrated with real examples taken from the literature and with simulated data, and practical aspects related to model building and diagnostics of the assumed mixed-effects model are discussed.","Profile Responses,Robust Design,Signal-Response Systems","ROBUST DESIGN EXPERIMENTS,PARAMETER DESIGN,SURFACE OPTIMIZATION,SYSTEMS","del Castillo, Enrique@Penn State Univ, Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA::Colosimo, Bianca M.@Politecn Milan, Prod Technol Grp, Dipartimento Meccan, I-20133 Milan, Italy::Alshraideh, Hussam@Jordan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn, Irbid 22110, Jordan","del Castillo, Enrique@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University::Colosimo, Bianca M.@Polytechnic University of Milan::Alshraideh, Hussam@Jordan University of Science & Technology","Colosimo, Bianca@C-1081-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6844-2030","no title+no author+Robust Designs Using Taguchi Methods+1998::no title+Carlin, BP; Louis, TA.+Bayes and Empirical Bayes Methods for Data Analysis+2000::On MCMC sampling in hierarchical longitudinal models+Chib, S; Carlin, BP+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+JAN 1999::no title+Congdon, P.+Bayesian Statistical Modeling+2006::Design and Modeling for Computer Experiments Introduction+Fang, Kai-Tai; Li, Runze; Sudjianto, Agus+DESIGN AND MODELING FOR COMPUTER EXPERIMENTS+2006::no title+Fitzmaurice, G.

Directional Control Schemes for Multivariate Categorical Processes,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2012,23,19,We consider statistical process control of multivariate categorical processes and propose a Phase II log-linear directional control chart that exploits directional shift information and integrates the monitoring of multivariate categorical processes into the unified framework of multivariate binomial and multivariate multinomial distributions. We also suggest a diagnostic scheme for identifying the shift direction. Both the control chart and the diagnostic approach are simple and easily computed.

Confidence Bands for the Reliability Function of a Two-Parameter Exponential Model,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2012,19,3,"This paper considers the problem of constructing confidence bands for the reliability function of a two-parameter exponential distribution, which is widely used in reliability analysis. Both two-sided confidence bands and lower and upper one-sided confidence bands are considered with an exact confidence level. These confidence bands allow simultaneous inferences at the specified confidence level for all points on the reliability function. They also allow simultaneous inferences for all quantiles of the reliability function. The confidence bands are generated from an exact confidence set for the two parameters of the exponential distribution. Optimal minimum area confidence sets are derived for the two-sided case. These methodologies are applicable for a complete data set or a data set with type II censoring, and they are illustrated with some examples.","Chi-Square Distribution,Confidence Interval,Confidence Set,Failure Times Minimum Area,One-Sided,Quantiles,Reliability Function,Two-Sided,Type II Censoring",REGRESSION,"Hayter, A.

Semiconductor Contamination: Eliciting a Physical Model Through Factorial Experimentation,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2012,16,1,"Problem: In semiconductor manufacturing of integrated circuits, the transfer of metallic contaminants onto the silicon wafers can be a problem. An understanding of this contamination process, particularly for copper from cleaning solutions onto a wafer surface, is important in assessing the need for purer solutions and cleaner processing systems. These issues will grow in importance as technology advances and chip sizes become increasingly larger. This paper describes our development of a physical deposition model for copper from a cleaning solution onto a wafer surface

Approach: We focus on the planning, design, and analysis of a three-factor, three-level factorial experiment to explore a mechanistic or physical model for a deposition mechanism, and evaluate the efficacy of this model. We postulated this model based on the results of two, two-level, highly fractionated experiments in which we acquired basic measurement knowledge, established which contaminants transfer onto the wafers, and fit an empirical transfer model. During the course of our research, we traversed three stages in acquiring knowledge through experimentation, delineated by Box and Draper (2007) as screening (which?), empirical (how?), and mechanistic (why?). The theory underlying this model is described in the section titled Process Description and Introduction. See the supplement at http://www.asq.org/pub/jqt/ for a more detailed explanation of the theory.

Results: We develop a physical model for the deposition of copper from a solution onto a wafer given by the following prediction equation:

(Cu) over cap water = 8.7 . 10(16) Cu-soln . t . exp{-1/30}, (1)

where Cu-wafer is the density of the copper deposition on the wafer surface in atoms per square centimeter, Cusoin is the copper contamination concentration in a buffered oxide etchant solution in parts per billion (ppb), t is the wafer immersion time length in minutes, k is Boltzmann's constant (8.617343 . 10(-5) eV. K-1), and T is the solution temperature in Kelvin. The coefficients of the three factors are of particular note; two are unity and the last is 1/3.

Our selection of the factor space, which was influenced by measurement capabilities, was Cusoin (20-500 ppb), time (1-25 minutes), and temperature (228-323 K). At room temperature of 296 K (23 degrees C or 73 degrees F) for a solution concentration of 1 ppb and a time length of 1 minute, the predicted wafer contamination density and the 95% confidence limits are 2.06 . 10(11) and (1.75 . 10(11), 2.43 . 10(11)), respectively, which agrees with the empirical Equation (2) developed in our preliminary experiments.

The equations for the prediction equation and confidence intervals are explained in the section titled. Analysis and Interpretation of Experimental Results. Our goal was to construct an equation for assessing future requirements by extrapolating to contamination levels below 20 ppb, the lowest value employed in the experiments.","Intrinsically Linear Functions,Least-Squares Parameter Estimation,Nonreplicated Experiments,Physical Models,Pseudo Error,Response Surface Analysis,Semiconductor Contamination,Three-Level Factorial Experiments",DESIGNS,"Ramberg, John S.@Univ Arizona, Coll Engn, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA::Parks, Harold C.@Univ Arizona, Coll Engn, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA::Maanum, Kristen A.@Univ Arizona, Coll Engn, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Ramberg, John S.@University of Arizona::Parks, Harold C.@University of Arizona::Maanum, Kristen A.@University of Arizona",not exist,"no title+Box, G.

Bayesian Inference for the Piecewise Exponential Model for the Reliability of Multiple Repairable Systems,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2012,31,4,"The piecewise exponential (PEXP) model for the reliability of multiple repairable systems is considered, and classic (maximum likelihood) and Bayesian inference are discussed under different model assumptions. In particular, inference using empirical and hierarchical Bayesian approaches are discussed. The PEXP model assumes that the times between failure are independent and exponentially distributed, but the mean is allowed to either increase or decrease with each failure. It can be an appropriate model for repairable systems in the context of reliability growth, specifically, test, analyze, and fix (TAAF), where the failure intensity remains constant as long as the system is working and can take discrete jumps at the time of a failure. It can also be applied when failures cause damage to the system, while system reliability remains constant during operation. By contrast, the nonhomogeneous Poisson process assumes that the reliability changes continuously and is unaffected by a failure. The application of this model to a real data set is presented under the hierarchical Bayesian approach and the classic and parametric empirical Bayes approach.","Hierarchical Bayes,Markov Chain Monte Carlo,Maximum Likelihood,Parametric Empirical Bayes,Reliability Growth,Test,Analyze,Fix",LAW PROCESS MODEL,"Arab, Ali@Georgetown Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Washington, DC 20057 USA::Rigdon, Steven E.@So Illinois Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA::Basu, Asit P.@Univ Missouri, Dept Stat, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Arab, Ali@Georgetown University::Rigdon, Steven E.@Southern Illinois University System@Southern Illinois University Edwardsville::Basu, Asit P.@University of Missouri Columbia@University of Missouri System",not exist,"no title+[Anonymous].+WinBugs+2003::no title+Ascher, H; Feingold, H.+Repairable systems reliability+1984::Examples of Parametric Empirical Bayes Methods for the Estimation of Failure Processes for Repairable Systems+BASU, A.

Phase I Risk-Adjusted Control Charts for Monitoring Surgical Performance by Considering Categorical Covariates,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2012,25,14,"In recent years risk-adjusted control charts have been increasingly studied for monitoring surgical outcomes by accounting for patients' health conditions prior to surgery. However, most existing research focuses on phase II monitoring, and very little work has been done on phase I control of surgical outcomes. In this paper, a general phase I risk-adjusted control chart is proposed for monitoring binary surgical outcomes based on a likelihood-ratio test derived from a change-point model. Different from the existing methods, this paper further shows that the binary surgical outcomes depend on not only the patient conditions described by the Parsonnet scores but also on other categorical operational covariates, such as different surgeons. The proposed risk-adjustment model is fitted by incorporating dummy variables to reflect different surgeon groups' performance. The analysis of a case study and simulation results show that the inclusion of surgeon groups as a categorical covariate in the risk-adjustment model can effectively reflect the inherent data heterogeneity, thus improving the estimation of the risk-adjustment model parameters. As expected, the proposed risk-adjusted control charts can achieve a better detection performance by including the surgeon covariate.","Binary Outcome,Change-Point Model,Likelihood-Ratio Test,Logistic Regression,RiskAdjustment Model,Surgical Performance","WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE,CHANGE-POINT MODEL,INDIVIDUAL OBSERVATIONS,TIME,OUTCOMES","Paynabar, Kamran@Univ Michigan, Dept Ind & Operat Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA::Jin, Jionghua (Judy)@Univ Michigan, Dept Ind & Operat Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA::Yeh, Arthur B.@Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Operat Res & Appl Stat, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA","Paynabar, Kamran@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan::Jin, Jionghua (Judy)@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan::Yeh, Arthur B.@Bowling Green State University",not exist,"no title+Berger, R.

On the Equivalence of the Bernoulli and Geometric CUSUM Charts,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2012,16,9,"The Bernoulli cumulative sum (CUSUM) chart has been shown to have good properties in detecting an increase in the nonconforming rate, p, based on the average number of observations to signal (ANOS). The geometric CUSUM chart has also been proposed, in particular for high-quality processes where p is very small. The geometric CUSUM chart has very good properties in a zero-state analysis because of a built-in headstart feature. In steady-state performance analyses, often a shift in the process has been assumed to occur immediately after a nonconforming item has been found. In this case, the performance of the geometric CUSUM chart is said to be better than that of the Bernoulli CUSUM chart. We explore the case where a process shift may occur at any time. We show that the steady-state properties of the Bernoulli CUSUM and geometric CUSUM charts are the same because the charts can be designed to be mathematically equivalent.","Attributes Data,Average Number of Observations to Signal,Fixed-Shift Model,High-Quality Processes,Random-Shift Model","HIGH-YIELD PROCESSES,SURVEILLANCE,PROPORTION,INSPECTION","Szarka, John L., III@WL Gore & Assoc Inc, Elkton, MD 21922 USA::Woodall, William H.@Virginia Tech, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Szarka, John L., III@Unknow::Woodall, William H.@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University",not exist,"Performance comparisons for the synthetic control chart for detecting increases in fraction nonconforming+Bourke, Patrick D.+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 2008::The geometric CUSUM chart with sampling inspection for monitoring fraction defective+Bourke, PD+JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS+NOV 2001::DETECTING A SHIFT IN FRACTION NONCONFORMING USING RUN-LENGTH CONTROL CHARTS WITH 100-PERCENT INSPECTION+BOURKE, PD+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1991::Cumulative sum charts for high yield processes+Chang, TC; Gan, FF+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 2001::Modified Shewhart charts for high yield processes+Chang, Tee Chin; Gan, Fah Fatt+JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS+2007::Statistical control of a six sigma process+Goh, T.N.; Xie, M.+Quality Engineering+2003::Detecting a rate increase using a Bernoulli scan statistic+Joner, Michael D., Jr.; Woodall, William H.; Reynolds, Marion R., Jr.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUN 30 2008::A general approach to modeling CUSUM charts for a proportion+Reynolds, MR; Stoumbos, ZG+IIE TRANSACTIONS+2000::A CUSUM chart for monitoring a proportion when inspecting continuously+Reynolds, MR; Stoumbos, ZG+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 1999::no title+Ryan, T.

These designs have very nice properties for practical use. Their construction approach requires a computerized search. This short note provides a theoretical basis for design construction, making use of conference matrices. The design construction is straightforward, and the resulting design is always a global optimum definitive screening design.

System Monitoring with Real-Time Contrasts,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2012,40,16,"Monitoring real-time data steams is an important learning task in numerous disciplines. Traditional process-monitoring techniques are challenged by increasingly complex, high-dimensional data, mixed categorical and numerical variables, non-Gaussian distributions, nonlinear relationships, etc. A new monitoring method based on real-time contrasts (RTC) between the reference and real-time data is presented. RTC assigns one class label to the reference data, and another class label to a window of real-time data, and, thus, transforms the monitoring problem to a dynamic series of classification problems. This differs from previous work that trained a classifier one time at the start of monitoring. Furthermore, a number of monitoring statistics based on the generalized likelihood-ratio principle are discussed. These include error rates and class probability estimates from classifiers. Typically, the window size for the real-time data is much smaller than the size of the reference data and this class imbalance is also considered in the approach. Variable contributor diagnostics can be simultaneously obtained from the approach and are briefly discussed. Both mean and variance shifts are illustrated. Experiments are used to compare monitoring statistics and to illustrate performance advantages of RTC relative to alternative methods.","Control Charts,Generalized Likelihood Ratio,Multivariate Control Charts,Nonparametric,Statistical Process Control,Supervised Learning","STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,MULTIVARIATE CONTROL CHART,CHANGE-POINT DETECTION,EWMA CONTROL CHART,MANUFACTURING PROCESSES,ARTIFICIAL CONTRASTS,FAULT ISOLATION,MEAN VECTOR,SHIFTS,NONNORMALITY","Deng, Houtao@Intuit, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA::Runger, George@Arizona State Univ, Sch Comp Informat & Decis Syst Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA::Tuv, Eugene@Intel Corp, Log Technol Dept, Chandler, AZ 85226 USA","Deng, Houtao@Unknow::Runger, George@Arizona State University::Tuv, Eugene@Intel Corporation",not exist,"The GLRT for statistical process control of autocorrelated processes+Apley, DW; Shi, J+IIE TRANSACTIONS+SEP 1999::A factor-analysis method for diagnosing variability in multivariate manufacturing processes+Apley, DW; Shi, JJ+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 2001::Robustness of the EWMA control chart to non-normality+Borror, CM; Montgomery, DC; Runger, GC+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1999::no title+Breiman, L; Friedman, JH; Olshen, RA<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Stone, CJ</span>.+Classification and Regression Trees+1984::Random forests+Breiman, L+MACHINE LEARNING+OCT 2001::A classification procedure for highly imbalanced class sizes+Byon, Eunshin; Shrivastava, Abhishek K.; Ding, Yu+IIE TRANSACTIONS+2010::Robust kernel distance multivariate control chart using support vector principles+Camci, F.; Chinnam, R.

Estimation for Conformance Proportions in a Normal Variance Components Model,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2012,31,5,"Two approaches are proposed for constructing one- and two-sided confidence limits for conformance proportions in a normal variance components model. One approach is based on the concepts of a generalized pivotal quantity, and the other is developed using the modified large-sample method for estimating linear combinations of variance components. The performance of the proposed methods is evaluated through detailed simulation studies. The results reveal that the empirical coverage probabilities for both methods are close to the claimed values and hence their performance is judged to be satisfactory. Nonetheless, the modified large sample-based method might be recommended in practical applications due to its slightly better performance and computational ease. The framework established in this article can be applied to conformance proportion questions arising in arbitrary balanced mixed linear-model situations. The methods are illustrated using three real datasets. Finally, a bootstrap calibration approach is adopted to have empirical coverage probabilities sufficiently close to the nominal level for the proposed methods.","Generalized Pivotal Quantity,Modified Large Sample,Parametric Bootstrap,Process-Capability Index,Tolerance Interval","GENERALIZED CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS,2-SIDED TOLERANCE INTERVALS,WAY RANDOM MODELS,LINEAR-COMBINATIONS,LIMITS","Lee, Hsin-I@Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Agron, Div Biometry, Taipei 10617, Taiwan::Liao, Chen-Tuo@Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Agron, Div Biometry, Taipei 10617, Taiwan","Lee, Hsin-I@National Taiwan University@Agricultural Research Institute of Taiwan::Liao, Chen-Tuo@National Taiwan University@Agricultural Research Institute of Taiwan","Liao, Chen-Tuo@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9777-3701","no title+Burdick, R.

Robust Location Estimators for the (X)over-bar Control Chart,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2011,16,25,"This article studies estimation methods for the location parameter. We consider several robust location estimators as well as several estimation methods based on a phase I analysis, i.e., the use of a control chart to study a historical dataset retrospectively to identify disturbances. In addition, we propose a new type of phase I analysis. The estimation methods are evaluated in terms of their mean-squared errors and their effect on the (X) over bar control charts used for real-time process monitoring (phase II). It turns out that the phase I control chart based on the trimmed trimean far outperforms the existing estimation methods. This method has therefore proven to be very suitable for determining (X) over bar phase II control chart limits.","Estimation,Mean,Phase I,Phase II,Robust,Shewhart Control Chart,Statistical Process Control,Trimean",,"Schoonhoven, Marit@Univ Amsterdam, Inst Business & Ind Stat, IBIS UvA, NL-1018 TV Amsterdam, Netherlands::Nazir, Hafiz Z.@Univ Sargodha, Dept Stat, Sargodha, Pakistan::Riaz, Muhammad@King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Dept Math & Stat, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia@Quaid I Azam Univ, Dept Stat, Islamabad 45320, Pakistan::Does, Ronald J.

Design and Analysis of Control Charts for Standard Deviation with Estimated Parameters,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2011,29,44,This paper concerns the design and analysis of the standard deviation control chart with estimated limits. We consider an extensive range of statistics to estimate the in-control standard deviation (Phase I) and design the control chart for real-time process monitoring (Phase II) by determining the factors for the control limits. The Phase II performance of the design schemes is assessed when the Phase I data are uncontaminated and normally distributed as well as when the Phase I data are contaminated. We propose a robust estimation method based on the mean absolute deviation from the median supplemented with a simple screening method.

A Burn-In Scheme Based on Percentiles of the Residual Life,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2011,32,20,"Many commercial products sold with warranties suffer from infant-mortality problems. Burn-in is a common means to mitigate the impact of early failures on warranty costs. After burn-in, the p-percentile function of the residual life (PRL-p function) is of particular interest as, in some cases, there exists a change point at which the PRL-p function reaches a maximum value. When the failure probability during the warranty period is prespecified, this change point naturally gives rise to an optimal burn-in duration. Moreover, the maximal PRL-p represents the maximum allowable warranty period when the expected field return is set at p. We present some properties of this change point, and derive the asymptotic distribution of its parametric maximum likelihood estimator and that of the corresponding PRL-p. The procedure is then applied to estimate a set of desirable burn-in durations and the corresponding warranty periods when life-test data are available. An example using the modified Weibull extension model is given to illustrate the procedure.","Asymptotic Distribution,Bathtub Failure Rate,Burn In,Change Points,Generalized Weibull Distributions,Percentile of the Residual Life","FAILURE RATE-FUNCTION,WEIBULL DISTRIBUTION,WARRANTY,TIME,RELIABILITY,EXTENSION,POINT,MODEL,COST","Ye, Zhi Sheng@Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Singapore 119260, Singapore::Tang, Loon Ching@Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Singapore 119260, Singapore::Xie, Min@Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Singapore 119260, Singapore","Ye, Zhi Sheng@National University of Singapore::Tang, Loon Ching@National University of Singapore::Xie, Min@National University of Singapore","Xie, Min@A-5552-2011@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8500-8364","no title+Bagdonavicius, V.; Nikulin, M.+Accelerated Life Models: Modeling and Statistical Analysis+2002::Estimating the turning point of a bathtub-shaped failure distribution+Bebbington, Mark; Lai, Chin-Diew; Zitikis, Ricardas+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+APR 1 2008::Bathtub functions and burn-in+Block, HW; Jong, YK; Savits, TH+PROBABILITY IN THE ENGINEERING AND INFORMATIONAL SCIENCES+1999::Optimal burn-in for minimizing total warranty cost+Cha, Ji Hwan; Yamamoto, Hisashi; Yun, Won Young+IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON FUNDAMENTALS OF ELECTRONICS COMMUNICATIONS AND COMPUTER SCIENCES+FEB 2008::A new two-parameter lifetime distribution with bathtub shape or increasing failure rate function+Chen, ZM+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+AUG 15 2000::BURN-IN TIME AND ESTIMATION OF CHANGE-POINT WITH WEIBULL-EXPONENTIAL MIXTURE DISTRIBUTION+CHOU, KC; TANG, K+DECISION SCIENCES+JUL-AUG 1992::Genetic algorithm to maximize a lower-bound for system time-to-failure with uncertain component Weibull parameters+Coit, DW; Smith, AE+COMPUTERS &amp; INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING+FEB 2002::ESTIMATION OF PERCENTILE RESIDUAL LIFE+CSORGO, M; CSORGO, S+OPERATIONS RESEARCH+JUL-AUG 1987::no title+Efron, B; Tibshirani, R.+An introduction to the bootstrap+1993::no title+FRANCOPEREIFTA AM+APPL STOCHASTIC MODE+2011::Generalized exponential distribution: Different method of estimations+Gupta, RD; Kundu, D+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+2001::Nonparametric inference on median residual life function+Jeong, Jong-Hyeon; Jung, Sin-Ho; Costantino, Joseph P.+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2008::PERCENTILE RESIDUAL LIFE FUNCTIONS+JOE, H; PROSCHAN, F+OPERATIONS RESEARCH+1984::Regression on Quantile Residual Life+Jung, Sin-Ho; Jeong, Jong-Hyeon; Bandos, Hanna+BIOMETRICS+DEC 2009::Percentile life and reliability as performance measures in optimal system design+Kim, KO; Kuo, W+IIE TRANSACTIONS+DEC 2003::Optimal burn-in for maximizing reliability of repairable non-series systems+Kim, Kyungmee O.; Kuo, Way+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH+FEB 16 2009::A modified Weibull distribution+Lai, CD; Xie, M; Murthy, DNP+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY+MAR 2003::GRAPHICAL TECHNIQUES FOR ANALYZING FAILURE DATA WITH THE PERCENTILE RESIDUAL-LIFE FUNCTION+LAUNER, RL+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY+MAR 1993::On second-order optimality of the observed Fisher information+Lindsay, BG; Li, B+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+OCT 1997::no title+MA Y+CANADIAN J  IN PRESS+2011::MAXIMIZATION OF A SURVIVAL PROBABILITY AND ITS APPLICATION+MI, J+JOURNAL OF APPLIED PROBABILITY+DEC 1994::Comparisons of renewable warranties+Mi, J+NAVAL RESEARCH LOGISTICS+FEB 1999::Warranty policies and burn-in+Mi, J+NAVAL RESEARCH LOGISTICS+MAR 1997::no title+MUDHOLKAR CS+TECHNOMETRICS+1995::no title+Murthy, D.; Prabhakar, N.; Xie, Min<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Jiang, Renyan</span>.+Weibull Models+2004::On recent generalizations of the weibull distribution+Pham, Hoang; Lai, Chin-Diew+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY+SEP 2007::Optimal burn-in time to minimize the cost for general repairable products sold under warranty+Sheu, SH; Chien, YH+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH+JUN 1 2005::EXPONENTIAL POWER LIFE-TESTING DISTRIBUTION+SMITH, RM; BAIN, LJ+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS+1975::Statistical analysis of a Weibull extension model+Tang, Y; Xie, M; Goh, TN+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2003::Optimal burn-in time and warranty length under fully renewing combination free replacement and pro-rata warranty+Wu, Chin-Chun; Chou, Chao-Yu; Huang, Chikong+RELIABILITY ENGINEERING &amp; SYSTEM SAFETY+JUL 2007::A modified Weibull extension with bathtub-shaped failure rate function+Xie, M; Tang, Y; Goh, TN+RELIABILITY ENGINEERING &amp; SYSTEM SAFETY+JUN 2002::Reliability analysis using an additive Weibull model with bathtub-shaped failure rate function+Xie, M; Lai, CD+RELIABILITY ENGINEERING &amp; SYSTEM SAFETY+APR 1996"
Weighted CUSUM Control Charts for Monitoring Poisson Processes with Varying Sample Sizes,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2011,27,9,"Monitoring inhomogeneous Poisson processes with varying sample sizes has attracted considerable attention recently in both industrial quality control and public-health surveillance. One of the key challenges in these applications is that a change in incidence rate may be masked by changes of sample sizes. The conventional Poisson cumulative sum (CUSUM) chart designed for detecting a prespecified change in the incidence rate could perform poorly when the actual change is different from the prespecified one. This phenomenon is especially prominent when the sample size is nonconstant and varies over time. To efficiently detect changes in the incidence rate with varying sample sizes, this paper proposes a class of weighted CUSUM (WCUSUM) schemes with general weight functions applied to the likelihood-ratio statistic. The comparison results with the traditional Poisson CUSUM method and other alternatives favor the proposed method. An example in health-care surveillance is used to illustrate the application of the proposed method.","Average Run Length,Incidence Rate,Likelihood Ratio,Statistical Process Control,Surveillance","QUALITY-CONTROL SCHEMES,SURVEILLANCE","Jiang, Wei@Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China::Shu, Lianjie@Univ Macau, Fac Business Adm, Taipa, Macau, Peoples R China::Tsui, Kwok-Leung@City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Mech Engn & Engn Management, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China@Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Ind & Syst Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Jiang, Wei@Shanghai Jiao Tong University::Shu, Lianjie@University of Macau::Tsui, Kwok-Leung@Georgia Institute of Technology@University System of Georgia@City University of Hong Kong","Shu, Lianjie@B-7911-2016::TSUI, Kwok Leung@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0558-2279","Differential -Geometrical Methods in Statistics+Amari, S.+LECT NOTES STAT+1985::FITTING OF POWER-SERIES, MEANING POLYNOMIALS, ILLUSTRATED ON BAND-SPECTROSCOPIC DATA+BEATON, AE; TUKEY, JW+TECHNOMETRICS+1974::Cumulative score charts+Box, GEP; Ramirez, J.+Quality and Reliability Engineering International+1992::An adaptive exponentially weighted moving average control chart+Capizzi, G; Masarotto, G+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 2003::Surveillance strategies for detecting changepoint in incidence rate based on exponentially weighted moving average methods+Dong, Yuping; Hedayat, A.

Analyzing the Effect of Process Parameters on the Shape of 3D Profiles,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2011,35,9,"This paper investigates the effect of process parameters on the shape of three-dimensional (3D) curves. Compared with recent literature on profile modeling (generally used for process monitoring applications), the main novelty consists of dealing with curves that do not lie in a plane but in space. In particular, a generalization of principal component analysis (PCA), based on the appropriate use of complex rather than real numbers (complex PCA), is used as a modeling tool. Scores of the significant components obtained via complex PCA are then used as data input for the analysis of variance to investigate the effect of process parameters on the machined shape. The first advantage of complex PCA is its insensitivity to rotation about the origin of the complex plane, a property that produces a significant simplification of the preliminary step of profile registration. Second, complex PCA outperforms alternative PCA-based approaches in terms of the power of detecting the effect of controllable factors on the profile shape. The proposed procedure is particularly useful when the quality characteristic of interest is related to geometric tolerances, as shown in a real case study of the axial straightness of lathe-turned items.","Design of Experiment (DOE),Functional Data,Geometric Product Specification (GPS),Geometric Tolerances,Principal Component Analysis (PCA),Profile","PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS,MULTIVARIATE-ANALYSIS,ROUNDNESS PROFILES,CONTROL CHARTS,DEVIATIONS,VARIABLES,PATTERNS","Colosimo, Bianca M.@Politecn Milan, Dept Mech Engn, I-20133 Milan, Italy::Pacella, Massimo@Univ Salento, Dept Ingn Innovaz, I-73100 Lecce, Italy","Colosimo, Bianca M.@Polytechnic University of Milan::Pacella, Massimo@University of Salento","Pacella, Massimo@I-5561-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3712-7932::Colosimo, Bianca@C-1081-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6844-2030","An extension to modeling cylindrical variables+AndersonCook, CM+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+OCT 15 1997::Dimensioning and Tolerancing+no author+Standard No. Y14.5-2009+2009::Image texture analysis: methods and comparisons+Bharati, MH; Liu, JJ; MacGregor, JF+CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS+JUN 28 2004::Multivariate image analysis for real-time process monitoring and control+Bharati, MH; MacGregor, JF+INDUSTRIAL &amp; ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH+DEC 1998::A comparison study of control charts for statistical monitoring of functional data+Colosimo, Bianca M.; Pacella, Massimo+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH+2010::Statistical process control for geometric specifications: On the monitoring of roundness profiles+Colosimo, Bianca M.; Semeraro, Quirico; Pacella, Massimo+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2008::On the use of principal component analysis to identify systematic patterns in roundness profiles+Colosimo, Bianca Maria; Pacella, Massimo+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+OCT 2007::no title+COLOSIMO BM+FRONTIERS STAT QUALI+2010::Geometric Tolerances: Impact on Product Design, Quality Inspection and Statistical Process Monitoring+no author+GEOMETRIC TOLERANCES: IMPACT ON PRODUCT DESIGN, QUALITY INSPECTION AND STATISTICAL PROCESS MONITORING+2011::Statistical Shape Analysis of Experiments for Manufacturing Processes+del Castillo, Enrique; Colosimo, Bianca M.+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 2011::Statistical issues in geometric feature inspection using coordinate measuring machines+Dowling, MM; Griffin, PM; Tsui, KL; et al.+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1997::no title+DRYDEN, I.

A Bayesian Plotting Method for Fractional Factorial Data Analysis,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2011,18,5,"This paper proposes a plot-based method for fractional factorial data analysis. The proposed plot is called a ""response-probability model analysis plot"" (RPMAP) because it displays the predicted responses associated with alternative models and decisions versus the model posterior probabilities. Benefits of the proposed method include unique information about whether the current state of model uncertainty and achievement of objectives warrants additional experimentation. Also, in some cases, the RPMAP leads to settings with arguably superior robustness to model uncertainty compared with normal probability plots or Posterior probability plots. The methods are illustrated using the well-studied injection molding data and another real-world case study. In both cases, new insights are gained with potential value to practitioners.","Design of Experiments,Mixture Model,Model Analysis Plot,Optimization,Screening Experiment","ROBUST DESIGN,UNCERTAINTY","Allen, Theodore T.@Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43221 USA::Rajagopalan, Ravishankar@John F Welch Technol Ctr, GE Energy, Bangalore 560066, Karnataka, India","Allen, Theodore T.@Ohio State University::Rajagopalan, Ravishankar@General Electric","Allen, Theodore@P-3387-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9522-3252","DOE and Regression Case Studies+Allen, Theodore T.+INTRODUCTION TO ENGINEERING STATISTICS AND LEAN SIGMA: STATISTICAL QUALITY CONTROL AND DESIGN OF EXPERIMENTS AND SYSTEMS, SECOND ED+2010::A cautious approach to robust design with model parameter uncertainty+Apley, Daniel W.; Kim, Jeongbae+IIE TRANSACTIONS+2011::Understanding the effects of model uncertainty in robust design with computer experiments+Apley, Daniel W.; Liu, Jun; Chen, Wei+JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN+JUL 2006::no title+Barton, R.+Graphical Methods for the Design of Experiments+1999::no title+Box, G.

Methods for Monitoring Multiple Proportions When Inspecting Continuously,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2011,18,25,"As technology advances, the need for methods to monitor processes that produce readily-available inspection data becomes essential. In this paper, a multinomial cumulative sum (CUSUM) chart is proposed to monitor in situations where items can be classified into more than two categories, the items are not put into subgroups, and the direction of the out-of-control shift in the parameter vector can be specified. It is shown through examples that the multinomial CUSUM chart can detect shifts in category probabilities at least as quickly and, in most cases, faster than using multiple Bernoulli CUSUM charts. The properties of the multinomial CUSUM chart are determined through a Markov chain representation.

Monitoring the Coefficient of Variation Using EWMA Charts,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2011,23,48,The coefficient of variation (CV) is a quality characteristic that has several applications in applied statistics and is receiving increasing attention in quality control. A few papers have proposed control charts that monitor this normalized measure of dispersion. This paper suggests a new method to monitor the CV by means of two one-sided EWMA charts of the coefficient of variation squared gamma(2). Tables are provided for the statistical properties of the EWMA-gamma(2) when the shift size is deterministic or unknown. An example illustrates the use of these charts on real data gathered from a metal sintering process.,"Average Run Length,Markov Chain,Unknown Shift Size","CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS,PERCENTAGE POINTS,DESIGN,TESTS","Castagliola, Philippe@Univ Nantes, LUNAM Univ, Dept Qual Logist & Ind Org, Nantes, France@IRCCyN UMR CNRS 6597, Nantes, France::Celano, Giovanni@Univ Catania, Dept Ind & Mech Engn, Catania, Italy::Psarakis, Stelios@Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Stat, Athens, Greece","Castagliola, Philippe@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)@Universite de Nantes::Celano, Giovanni@University of Catania::Psarakis, Stelios@Athens University of Economics & Business","Celano, Giovanni@C-1052-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7871-7499","An almost unbiased estimator of the coefficient of variation+Breunig, R+ECONOMICS LETTERS+JAN 2001::APPROACH TO PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION OF CUSUM RUN LENGTH+BROOK, D; EVANS, DA+BIOMETRIKA+1972::On the economic-statistical design of control charts constrained by the inspection workstation configuration+Celano, G.+International Journal of Quality Engineering and Technology+2010::Robust design of adaptive control charts for manual manufacturing/inspection workstations+Celano, Giovanni+JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS+2009::The sampling distribution of the coefficient of variation+Hendricks, WA; Robey, KW+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1936::Development of CV control chart using EWMA technique+Hong, E.

Profile Monitoring with Binary Data and Random Predictors,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2011,32,27,"The purpose of profile monitoring is to check the stability over time of relationships between response variables and one or more explanatory variables. In many applications, categorical response variables are common and a generalized linear model is usually utilized to model this kind of profile for quality improvement. In practice, different profiles often have random explanatory variables and these variables require careful monitoring as well. Statistical process control is important and challenging for monitoring profiles in such situations. A novel control chart is proposed by integrating an exponentially weighted moving-average scheme and a likelihood-ratio test for the parameters of a logistic regression model. This new scheme not only monitors the functional relationship of the profile but also the mean of the explanatory variables. The proposed chart has reasonable computational and implementation complexity and is efficient in detecting shifts. The simulation results show that it performs better than the standard benchmarks in the literatures for the array of simulation examples that we consider. A real example from the electronic industries is used to illustrate the implementation of the proposed approach.","Categorical Response,Exponential Weighted Moving Average,Generalized Linear Model,Profile Monitoring,Random Explanatory Variables,Statistical Process Control","PHASE-I ANALYSIS,CONTROL CHART,LINEAR PROFILES,NONLINEAR PROFILES,QUALITY PROFILES,MIXED MODELS,REGRESSION,SCHEMES,PRODUCT","Shang, Yanfen@Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Logist Management, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China::Tsung, Fugee@Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Logist Management, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China::Zou, Changliang@Nankai Univ, LPMC, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China@Nankai Univ, Dept Stat, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China","Shang, Yanfen@Hong Kong University of Science & Technology::Tsung, Fugee@Hong Kong University of Science & Technology::Zou, Changliang@Nankai University",not exist,"Statistical Process Monitoring of Nonlinear Profiles Using Wavelets+Chicken, Eric; Pignatiello, Joseph, Jr.; Simpson, James R.+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 2009::Statistical process control for geometric specifications: On the monitoring of roundness profiles+Colosimo, Bianca M.; Semeraro, Quirico; Pacella, Massimo+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2008::Phase I analysis for monitoring nonlinear profiles in manufacturing processes+Ding, Yu; Zeng, Li; Zhou, Shiyu+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 2006::Change point problems in the model of logistic regression+Gurevich, G; Vexler, A+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+MAY 1 2005::Profile Monitoring via Nonlinear Mixed Models+Jensen, Willis A.; Birch, Jeffrey B.+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2009::Monitoring correlation within linear profiles using mixed models+Jensen, Willis A.; Birch, Jeffrey B.; Woodall, William H.+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 2008::Effects of parameter estimation on control chart properties: A literature review+Jensen, Willis A.; Jones-Farmer, L.

There are a number of applications of control charts for these high-dimensional image data to detect changes in process performance and to increase process efficiency. We review the control charts that have been proposed for use with image data in industry and in some medical-device applications and discuss their advantages and disadvantages in some cases. In addition, we highlight some application opportunities available in the use of control charts with image data and provide some advice to practitioners.","Image-Based Monitoring,Machine-Vision Systems,Multivariate Image Analysis,Profile Monitoring,Shewhart Control Chart,Statistical Process Control","STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,AUTOMATED VISUAL INSPECTION,X-RAY ABSORPTIOMETRY,T-2 CONTROL CHART,QUALITY-CONTROL,DEFECT INSPECTION,CLUSTERED DEFECTS,IC FABRICATION,CUSUM ANALYSIS,VISION SYSTEM","Megahed, Fadel M.@Virginia Tech, Grado Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Woodall, William H.@Unknow::Camelio, Jaime A.@Virginia Tech, Grado Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Megahed, Fadel M.@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Woodall, William H.@Unknow::Camelio, Jaime A.@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University","Megahed, Fadel@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2194-5110","A computer vision approach for textile quality control+Anagnostopoulos, C;

Measurement System Analysis for Binary Inspection: Continuous Versus Dichotomous Measurands,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2011,19,13,"We review methods for assessing the reliability of binary measurements, such as accept/reject inspection in industry. Our framework introduces two factors that are highly relevant in deciding which method to use: (1) whether a reference value (gold standard) can be obtained and (2) whether the underlying measurand is continuous or truly dichotomous. Artificially dichotomizing a continuous measurand, as is commonly done, creates complications that are underappreciated in the literature and in practice. In particular, it introduces an intrinsic reason for the assumption of conditional i.i.d. to be violated. For most methods, this is not crucial provided the samples are random (or at least representative). But, also for most methods, it is, in general, not clear how one can obtain a random sample from the relevant population. The taxonomy presents methods that are generally known in industry, such as nonparametric estimation of false-acceptance and false-rejection probabilities, AIAG's analytic method (logistic regression), latent class modeling, and latent trait modeling. The methods discussed are applied to an example presented in the measurement-system-analysis manual from the automotive industry.","Agreement,Binary Measurement,Categorical Data,Conditional Independence,Gauge Capability,Latent Variable Modeling,Pass/Fail Inspection,Repeatability,Reproducibility","KAPPA-TYPE INDEXES,AGREEMENT","De Mast, Jeroen@Univ Amsterdam IBIS UvA, Inst Business & Ind Stat, NL-1018 TV Amsterdam, Netherlands::Erdmann, Tashi P.@Univ Amsterdam IBIS UvA, Inst Business & Ind Stat, NL-1018 TV Amsterdam, Netherlands::Van Wieringen, Wessel N.@VUmc Univ Med Ctr, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, NL-1018 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands@Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Math, NL-1018 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands","De Mast, Jeroen@University of Amsterdam::Erdmann, Tashi P.@University of Amsterdam::Van Wieringen, Wessel N.@Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam@VU UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER","van Wieringen, Wessel@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5100-9123","no title+no author+Measurement system analysis: reference manual+2003::A Bayesian Model to Assess a Binary Measurement System When No Gold Standard System Is Available+Beavers, Daniel P.; Stamey, James D.; Bekele, B.

Self-Starting Multivariate Control Charts for Location and Scale,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2011,27,12,"Multivariate control charts are advisable when monitoring several correlated characteristics. The multivariate exponentially weighted moving average (MEWMA) is ideal for monitoring the mean vector, and the multivariate exponentially weighted moving covariance matrix (MEWMC) detects changes in the covariance matrix. Both charts were established under the assumption that the parameters are known a priori. This is seldom the case, and Phase I data sets are commonly used to estimate the chart's in-control parameter values. Plugging in parameter estimates, however, fundamentally changes the run-length distribution from those assumed in the known-parameter theory and diminishes chart performance, even for large calibration samples. Self-starting methods, which correctly studentize the incoming stream of process readings, provide exact control right from start up. We extend the existing multivariate self-starting methodology to a combination chart for both the mean vector and the covariance matrix. This approach is shown to have good performance.","Average Run Length (ARL),Cholesky Decomposition,Multistandardization,Recursive Residual,Regression Adjustment","INDIVIDUAL OBSERVATIONS,PARAMETERS,T-2","Maboudou-Tchao, Edgard M.@Univ Cent Florida, Dept Stat, Orlando, FL 32816 USA::Hawkins, Douglas M.@Univ Minnesota, Sch Stat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Maboudou-Tchao, Edgard M.@State University System of Florida@University of Central Florida::Hawkins, Douglas M.@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities",not exist,"Multivariate quality control+Alt, FB.+The encyclopedia of statistical sciences+1984::no title+Anderson, T.+An Introdiction to Multivariate Statistical Analysis+1984::TECHNIQUES FOR TESTING CONSTANCY OF REGRESSION RELATIONSHIPS OVER TIME+BROWN, RL; DURBIN, J; EVANS, JM+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1975::Self-Starting CUSCORE Control Charts for Individual Multivariate Observations+Capizzi, Giovanna; Masarotto, Guido+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 2010::REGRESSION UPDATING+CHAMBERS, JM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1971::Properties of the T-2 control chart when parameters are estimated+Champ, CW; Jones-Farmer, LA; Rigdon, SE+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 2005::no title+FATTI PL+J AM STAT ASSOC+1986::SELF-STARTING CUSUM CHARTS FOR LOCATION AND SCALE+HAWKINS, DM+STATISTICIAN+1987::Multivariate exponentially weighted moving covariance matrix+Hawkins, Douglas M.; Maboudou-Tchao, Edgard M.+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 2008::Self-starting multivariate exponentially weighted moving average control charting+Hawkins, Douglas M.; Maboudou-Tchao, Edgard M.+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 2007::no title+Hotelling, H.+Multivariate quality control in techniques of statistical analysis+1947::Monitoring multivariate process variability for individual observations+Huwang, Longcheen; Yeh, Arthur B.; Wu, Chien-Wei+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 2007::The performance of exponentially weighted moving average charts with estimated parameters+Jones, LA; Champ, CW; Rigdon, SE+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 2001::A MULTIVARIATE EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE CONTROL CHART+LOWRY, CA; WOODALL, WH; CHAMP, CW; et al.+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1992::DECOMPOSITION OF T-2 FOR MULTIVARIATE CONTROL CHART INTERPRETATION+MASON, RL; TRACY, ND; YOUNG, JC+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 1995::no title+Montgomery, D.

Monitoring Batch Processes with Multiple On-Off Steps in Semiconductor Manufacturing,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2011,35,6,"A modern semiconductor manufacturing line is made of hundreds of sequential batch-processing stages. Each of these stages consists of many steps carried out by expensive tools, which are monitored by numerous sensors capable of sampling at intervals of seconds. The sensor readings of each run constitute profiles, which can include extremely drastic changes. The heterogeneous variations at different profile points are mainly due to on-off recipe actions at specific points. In addition, the analysis of these profiles is further complicated by long-term trends due to tool aging and short-term effects specific to the first wafer in a lot cycle. Statistical process control methods that fail to take these effects into consideration will lead to frequent false alarms. A systematic method is proposed to address these challenges. First, a reference profile is determined for each sensor variable that describes the on-off actions. Next, level shifts of these profiles in each step are established to capture and remove intrinsic variations due to long-term aging trends and the short-term first-wafer effects. The residuals are used to formulate a health index, and this index can be used to monitor the health of the equipment and detect faulty wafers efficiently.","Batch-Processing Stages,Health Index,Heterogeneous Variation,Multivariate Statistical Process Control,Sensor Data,Signal Map","PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS,LINEAR PROFILES,FAULT-DETECTION,NONLINEAR PROFILES,MIXED MODELS,ETCH PROCESS,WAVELETS,CHARTS","Lee, Shui-Pin@Ching Yun Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Tao Yuan 32097, Taiwan::Chao, An-Kuo@Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Inst Stat, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan::Tsung, Fugee@Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Logist Management, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China::Wong, David Shan Hill@Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan::Tseng, Sheng-Tsiang@Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Inst Stat, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan::Jang, Shi-Shang@Unknow","Lee, Shui-Pin@Ching Yun University::Chao, An-Kuo@National Tsing Hua University::Tsung, Fugee@Hong Kong University of Science & Technology::Wong, David Shan Hill@National Tsing Hua University::Tseng, Sheng-Tsiang@National Tsing Hua University::Jang, Shi-Shang@Unknow","Wong, David@I-6233-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8574-8234","A NEW METHOD OF INTERPOLATION AND SMOOTH CURVE FITTING BASED ON LOCAL PROCEDURES+AKIMA, H+JOURNAL OF THE ACM+1970::Nonparametric Profile Monitoring by Mixed Effects Modeling Comment+Apley, Daniel W.+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 2010::SOME THEOREMS ON QUADRATIC FORMS APPLIED IN THE STUDY OF ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE PROBLEMS .1.

A Split-Plot Experiment with Factor-Dependent Whole-Plot Sizes,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2011,19,6,"Problem: The dairy company FrieslandCampina had an opportunity to redesign the production process for its coffee cream. This product has a very specific viscosity, and the redesigned process had to result in the same viscosity as the old one.

Approach: For an effective redesign, the investigators wanted to obtain a simple model linking the settings of nine controllable factors to the viscosity of the product. They decided to use the results of a statistically designed experiment to build such a model. Two factors were hard to change (HTC) and could only be set six times; the remaining factors were easy to change (ETC). The presence of HTC and ETC factors calls for a split-plot experiment with whole plots defined by the six settings of the HTC factors. However, the number of runs within a whole plot depended on the level of one of the whole-plot factors. Commercial software fails to produce designs for this situation. In this paper, we detail orthogonal and nonorthogonal whole-plot designs for each of three total run sizes and discuss how three existing algorithms to construct optimal split-plot designs can be modified to handle factor-dependent whole-plot sizes.

Results: The experiment was conducted according to one of the designs and viscosity measurements of the products were made. A second-order model, fitted using generalized least squares and restricted maximum likelihood, was used to study the effect of changes to the process design on the viscosity.","Coordinate-Exchange Algorithm,D-Optimum Designs,Point-Exchange Algorithm,Restricted Randomization",RESPONSE-SURFACE DESIGNS,"Schoen, Eric@TNO, Sci & Ind, Dept Comp Vis & Stat, Delft, Netherlands@Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, Antwerp, Belgium::Jones, Bradley@Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, Antwerp, Belgium::Goos, Peter@Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, Antwerp, Belgium@Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands@SAS Inst Inc, JMP Div, Cary, NC 27513 USA","Schoen, Eric@University of Antwerp@Netherlands Organization Applied Science Research::Jones, Bradley@University of Antwerp::Goos, Peter@University of Antwerp@Erasmus University Rotterdam",not exist,"no title+ALMINI AA+J Quality Technology+2009::Designing fractional factorial split-plot experiments with few whole-plot factors+Bingham, DR; Schoen, ED; Sitter, RR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2004::The design and analysis of 2(k-p) x 2(q-r) split plot experiments+Bisgaard, S+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2000::COMPUTER-AIDED BLOCKING OF FACTORIAL AND RESPONSE-SURFACE DESIGNS+COOK, RD; NACHTSHEIM, CJ+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 1989::no title+Cornell, J.

Exchange Algorithms for Constructing Model-Robust Experimental Designs,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2011,41,5,"Optimal experimental design procedures, utilizing criteria such as D-optimality, are useful for producing designs for quantitative responses, often under nonstandard conditions such as constrained design spaces. However, these methods require a priori knowledge of the exact form of the response function, an often unrealistic assumption. Model-robust designs are those that, from our perspective, are efficient with respect to a set of possible models. In this paper, we develop a model-robust technique motivated by a connection to multiresponse D-optimal design. This link spawns a generalization of the modified Fedorov exchange algorithm, which is then used to construct exact model-robust designs. We also study the effectiveness of designs robust for a small set of models compared with designs that account for much larger sets. We give several examples and compare our designs with two model-robust procedures in the literature.","D-Optimality,Model Space,Multiresponse Design,Robust Design","SUPERSATURATED DESIGNS,POLYNOMIAL REGRESSION,MULTIPLE RESPONSE,LINEAR-MODELS,SELECTION,MINIMUM,BIAS","Smucker, Byran J.@Miami Univ, Oxford, OH 45056 USA::del Castillo, Enrique@Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA::Rosenberger, James L.@Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Smucker, Byran J.@Miami University::del Castillo, Enrique@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University::Rosenberger, James L.@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University",not exist,"Optimal design of multi-response experiments using semi-definite programming+Atashgah, Ali Babapour; Seifi, Abbas+OPTIMIZATION AND ENGINEERING+MAR 2009::no title+Atkinson, A.; Donev, A.; Tobias, R.+Optimum Experimental Designs, with SAS+2007::Incorporating prior information in optimal design for model selection+Bingham, Derek R.; Chipman, Hugh A.+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 2007::ON D-OPTIMAL DESIGNS FOR LINEAR-MODELS UNDER CORRELATED OBSERVATIONS WITH AN APPLICATION TO A LINEAR-MODEL WITH MULTIPLE RESPONSE+BISCHOFF, W+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+OCT 1993::A BASIS FOR THE SELECTION OF A RESPONSE-SURFACE DESIGN+BOX, GEP; DRAPER, NR+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1959::An algorithm to generate near D-optimal designs for multiple response surface models+Chang, S+IIE TRANSACTIONS+DEC 1997::Model robust designs+Chang, Y; Notz, W.+HANDB STAT+1996::MODEL ROBUST, LINEAR-OPTIMAL DESIGNS+COOK, RD; NACHTSHEIM, CJ+TECHNOMETRICS+1982::A COMPARISON OF ALGORITHMS FOR CONSTRUCTING EXACT D-OPTIMAL DESIGNS+COOK, RD; NACHTSHEIM, CJ+TECHNOMETRICS+1980::no title+Cornell, J.A.+Experiments with mixtures: designs, models, and the analysis of mixture data+1990::Robust designs for polynomial regression by maximizing a minimum of D- and D-1-efficiencies+Dette, H; Franke, T+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+AUG 2001::A GENERALIZATION OF D-OPTIMAL AND D1-OPTIMAL DESIGNS IN POLYNOMIAL REGRESSION+DETTE, H+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1990::A SIMPLE BAYESIAN MODIFICATION OF D-OPTIMAL DESIGNS TO REDUCE DEPENDENCE ON AN ASSUMED MODEL+DUMOUCHEL, W; JONES, B+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1994::no title+Emmett,, M.; Coos,, P.; Stillman,, E.+D-Optimal Designs for Multiple Polynomial Responses+2007::Robust regression designs for approximate polynomial models+Fang, ZD; Wiens, DP+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+DEC 1 2003::Integer-valued, minimax robust designs for estimation and extrapolation in heteroscedastic, approximately linear models+Fang, ZD; Wiens, DP+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2000::no title+Fedorov, Valerii V.+Theory of optimal experiments.

Two MEWMA Charts for Gumbel's Bivariate Exponential Distribution,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2011,43,12,"Data described by the exponential distribution are commonly encountered in manufacturing processes, reliability analysis, and human-service management. Time between events (TBE) charts have been suggested to monitor exponential data. However, existing studies on TBE charts are limited to univariate cases assuming there is only one process characteristic of interest. In this paper, two multivariate exponential weighted moving average (MEWMA) charts are proposed for the simultaneous monitoring of the mean vector of Gumbel's bivariate exponential (GBE) TBE model: One based on the raw observations and the other based on the transformed data. A numerical example is given to illustrate the implementation of the two MEWMA charts. We compare the average run-length performances of the two proposed charts with the following individual TBE charts pairs: the paired individual t charts, the paired individual exponentially weighted moving-average (EWMA) charts on raw data, and the paired individual EWMA charts on transformed data. The results of the comparative studies show that our MEWMA charts outperform all the other charts. The proposed MEWMA charts can be easily extended to higher dimensions. Some brief discussions concerning monitoring Gumbel's multivariate exponential model with more than two variables are also included.","Average Run Length,Gumble's Bivariate Exponential Distribution,MEWMA Charts,Paired Individual Exponentially Weighted Moving-Average Charts,Paired Individual t-Charts","EWMA CONTROL CHARTS,WEIGHTED STANDARD DEVIATIONS,AVERAGE CONTROL CHART,INFERENCE PROCEDURES,MULTIVARIATE CUSUM,COVARIANCE-MATRIX,TIME,ROBUSTNESS,SCHEMES,MODEL","Xie, Yujuan@Natl Univ Singapore, Ind & Syst Engn Dept, Singapore 119260, Singapore::Xie, Min@Natl Univ Singapore, Ind & Syst Engn Dept, Singapore 119260, Singapore::Goh, Thong Ngee@Natl Univ Singapore, Ind & Syst Engn Dept, Singapore 119260, Singapore","Xie, Yujuan@National University of Singapore::Xie, Min@National University of Singapore::Goh, Thong Ngee@National University of Singapore","Xie, Min@A-5552-2011@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8500-8364","Robustness of the time between events CUSUM+Borror, CM; Keats, JB; Montgomery, DC+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH+OCT 15 2003::QUALITY-CONTROL TECHNIQUES FOR ZERO DEFECTS+CALVIN, TW+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPONENTS HYBRIDS AND MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY+1983::Cumulative quantity control charts for monitoring production processes+Chan, LY; Xie, M; Goh, TN+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH+JAN 20 2000::Multivariate CUSUM and EWMA control charts for skewed populations using weighted standard deviations+Chang, Young Soon+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+2007::A multivariate T-2 control chart for skewed populations using weighted standard deviations+Chang, YS; Bai, DS+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+FEB 2004::MULTIVARIATE GENERALIZATIONS OF CUMULATIVE SUM QUALITY-CONTROL SCHEMES+CROSIER, RB+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 1988::A BIVARIATE EXTENSION OF EXPONENTIAL-DISTRIBUTION+FREUND, JE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1961::Designs of one- and two-sided exponential EWMA charts+Gan, FF+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 1998::BIVARIATE EXPONENTIAL-DISTRIBUTIONS+GUMBEL, EJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1960::A Nonparametric Change-Point Control Chart+Hawkins, Douglas M.; Deng, Qiqi+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 2010::A general Multivariate exponentially weighted moving-average control chart+Hawkins, Douglas M.; Choi, Sungwoon; Lee, Sanghoon+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 2007::Multivariate exponentially weighted moving covariance matrix+Hawkins, Douglas M.; Maboudou-Tchao, Edgard M.+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 2008::no title+Hotelling, H.+Multivariate quality control in techniques of statistical analysis+1947::A CLASS OF MULTIVARIATE FAILURE TIME DISTRIBUTIONS+HOUGAARD, P+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1986::FITTING A MULTIVARIATE FAILURE TIME DISTRIBUTION+HOUGAARD, P+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY+OCT 1989::MODELING MULTIVARIATE SURVIVAL+HOUGAARD, P+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+1987::Distribution-Free Phase I Control Charts for Sub-group Location+Jones-farmer,, L.

A Class of Three-Level Designs for Definitive Screening in the Presence of Second-Order Effects,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2011,17,91,"Screening designs are attractive for assessing the relative impact of a large number of factors on a response of interest. Experimenters often prefer quantitative factors with three levels over two-level factors because having three levels allows for some assessment of curvature in the factor response relationship. Yet, the most familiar screening designs limit each factor to only two levels. We propose a new class of designs that have three levels, provide estimates of main effects that are unbiased by any second-order effect, require only one more than twice as many runs as there are factors, and avoid confounding of any pair of second-order effects. Moreover, for designs having six factors or more, our designs allow for the efficient estimation of the full quadratic model in any three factors. In this respect, our designs may render follow-up experiments unnecessary in many situations, thereby increasing the efficiency of the entire experimentation process. We also provide an algorithm for design construction.","Alias,Confounding,Coordinate Exchange Algorithm,D-Efficiency,Response Surface Designs,Robust Designs,Screening Designs","COMPOSITE DESIGNS,REGRESSION,SELECTION","Jones, Bradley@SAS Inst, JMP Div, Cary, NC 27513 USA@Univ Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium::Nachtsheim, Christopher J.@Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Dept Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Jones, Bradley@University of Antwerp::Nachtsheim, Christopher J.@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities",not exist,"Small, balanced, efficient and near rotatable central composite designs+Angelopoulos, P.; Evangelaras, H.; Koukouvinos, C.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+JUN 1 2009::no title+Box, G.E.P.; Draper, H.R.+Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces+1987::2K-P FRACTIONAL FACTORIAL DESIGNS .2.+BOX, GEP; HUNTER, JS+TECHNOMETRICS+1961::The Dantzig selector: Statistical estimation when p is much larger than n+Candes, Emmanuel; Tao, Terence+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 2007::Factor screening and response surface exploration+Cheng, SW; Wu, CFJ+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 2001::SMALL RESPONSE-SURFACE DESIGNS+DRAPER, NR; LIN, DKJ+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 1990::SMALL COMPOSITE DESIGNS+DRAPER, NR+TECHNOMETRICS+1985::Analyzing designed experiments with complex aliasing+Hamada, M; Wu, C.+Journal of Quality Technology+1992::Smallest composite designs for quadratic response surfaces+HARTLEY, H.

D-Optimal and D-Efficient Equivalent-Estimation Second-Order Split-Plot Designs,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2010,30,16,"Industrial experiments often involve factors that are hard to change or costly to manipulate and thus make it undesirable to use a complete randomization. In such cases, the split-plot design structure is a cost-efficient alternative that reduces the number of independent settings of the hard-to-change factors. In general, model estimation for split-plot designs requires the use of generalized least squares (GLS). However, for some split-plot designs (including not only classical agricultural split-plot designs, but also some second-order split-plot response surface designs), ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates are equivalent to GLS estimates. These designs are called equivalent-estimation designs and offer the advantage that estimation of the factor effects does not require estimation of the variance components in the split-plot model. As an alternative to these equivalent-estimation designs, one can use D-optimal designs that guarantee efficient estimation of the fixed effects of the statistical model that is appropriate given the split-plot structure. We explore the relationship between equivalent-estimation and D-optimal split-plot designs for a second-order response surface model and propose an algorithm for generating D-efficient equivalent-estimation split-plot designs.

A Distribution-Free Phase I Control Chart for Subgroup Scale,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2010,23,18,"Most Phase I control-chart methods are based on the often untested and unreasonable assumption of normally distributed process observations. While there has been some work on distribution-free Phase I procedures for process location, at present, we found no distribution-free Phase I methods for evaluating process scale. We propose a Phase I control chart that is distribution free when the process is in-control. This method can be used to define the in-control state of the process variability and to aid in identifying an in-control reference sample. The proposed scale charting method is compared with the traditional R- and S-charts using Monte Carlo simulation. We show that the in-control performance of the R- and S-charts is poor in Phase I, both when the process data follow a normal distribution and when the distribution deviates from the normal model. Our proposed method achieves desired in-control performance when used with both normal and nonnormal data and is sensitive to subgroup differences in process scale. We offer advice for combining this method with an existing distribution-free Phase I chart for studying process location.","Nonparametric,Retrospective,Shewhart Chart,Statistical Process Control","EWMA CONTROL CHARTS,HOMOGENEITY,TESTS","Jones-Farmer, L.

EWMA Charts for the Weibull Shape Parameter,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2010,30,20,"This article discusses exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) charts for monitoring the Weibull shape parameter beta. The charts are based on the sample range of the logarithms of the data and an unbiased estimator of 1/beta. The average run length (ARL) of the proposed chart is determined by beta and the sample size n. Hence, the design of a chart is based on the of interest, n, and the desired in-control ARL. Two-sided charts are derived, as well as one-sided charts for detecting specific shifts in beta. These charts are compared with the cumulative sum chart of Page (1954), which is known to have optimality properties. The EWMA schemes studied here are ARL unbiased in the sense that they are expected to detect shifts sooner than the in-control ARL. The proposed schemes are applied to monitoring the Weibull shape parameter of the strength distribution of a carbon fiber used in composite materials.","Average Run Length,Control Chart Limits,Page CUSUM,Sample Range,Statistical Process Control,Unbiased Control Charts","DISTRIBUTIONS,PERCENTILES","Pascual, Francis@Washington State Univ, Dept Stat, Pullman, WA 99164 USA","Pascual, Francis@Washington State University",not exist,"INFERENCES BASED ON CENSORED SAMPLING FROM WEIBULL OR EXTREME-VALUE DISTRIBUTION+BAIN, LJ+TECHNOMETRICS+1972::DCUHRE - AN ADAPTIVE MULTIDIMENSIONAL INTEGRATION ROUTINE FOR A VECTOR OF INTEGRALS+BERNTSEN, J; ESPELID, TO; GENZ, A+ACM TRANSACTIONS ON MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE+DEC 1991::A SIMPLE METHOD FOR STUDYING RUN-LENGTH DISTRIBUTIONS OF EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE CHARTS+CROWDER, SV+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1987::no title+ENGELHARDT M+TECHNOMETRICS+1973::no title+GALAMBOS J+ASYMPTOTIC THEORY EX+1981::no title+HUANG X+J STAT COMP IN PRESS+2010::no title+Lawless, J.

The Prediction Properties of Classical and Inverse Regression for the Simple Linear Calibration Problem,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2010,17,9,"The calibration of measurement systems is a fundamental but understudied problem within industrial statistics. In the classical context of this problem, standards produced by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) are used in chemical, mechanical, electrical, and materials-engineering analyses. Often, applications cast into this calibration framework do not provide ""gold standards"" such as the standards provided by NIST. This paper considers the classical calibration approach, in which the experiment treats the standards as the regressor and the observed values as the response to calibrate the instrument. The analyst then must invert the resulting regression model in order to use the instrument to make actual measurements in practice. This paper compares this classical approach to inverse regression, which treats the standards as the response and the observed measurements as the regressor in the calibration experiment. Such an approach is intuitively appealing because it is simple and easily implemented in most software. However, it violates some of the basic regression assumptions. In this paper, we study the properties of classical and inverse regression applied to calibration problems, compare their performance, and provide guidance to practitioners.","Calibration Intervals,Mathematical Modeling,Measurement-Uncertainty Analysis,Response-Surface Methodology.",,"Parker, Peter A.@NASA, Langley Res Ctr, Hampton, VA 23681 USA::Vining, G.

Estimating the Standard Deviation in Quality-Control Applications,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2010,14,28,"In estimating the standard deviation of a normally distributed random variable, a multiple of the sample range is often used instead of the sample standard deviation in view of the range's computational simplicity. Although it is well known that use of the sample standard deviation is more efficient if the sample size exceeds 2, many statistical quality-control textbooks argue that the loss in efficiency when using the sample range to estimate the process standard deviation is very small with relatively small sample sizes. In this paper, we show that this loss in efficiency can be relatively large even for very small sample sizes and thus strongly advise against using range-based methods. We found that some previously published tables of relative efficiencies were either mislabeled or inaccurate. We also make some recommendations when a number of samples have been taken over time.","Control Charts,Mean-Squared Error,Process Capability,Relative Efficiency,Statistical Process Control",,"Mahmoud, Mahmoud A.@Cairo Univ, Dept Stat, Fac Econ & Polit Sci, Cairo, Egypt::Henderson, G.

Augmented Measurement System Assessment,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2010,17,6,"The standard plan for the assessment of the variation due to a measurement system involves a number of operators repeatedly measuring a number of parts in a balanced design. In this article, we consider the performance of two types of (unbalanced) assessment plans. In each type, we use a standard plan augmented with a second component. In type A augmentation, each operator measures a different set of parts once each. In type B augmentation, each operator measures the same set of parts once each. The goal of the paper is to identify good augmented plans for estimating the gauge repeatability and reproducibility (GR&R), a ratio that compares the contribution of the measurement system to the overall process variation. We show that, if there are three or more operators or if we include the possibility of part-by-operator interaction, then use of an appropriate augmented plan can produce substantial gains in efficiency for estimating GR&R compared with the best standard plan with the same total number of measurements.","Gauge Repeatability and Reproducibility,Measurement Variation,Part-by-Operator Interaction,Repeatability,Reproducibility,Study Design",R-AND-R,"Stevens, Nathaniel T.@Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Business & Ind Stat Res Grp, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada::Browne, Ryan@Univ Guelph, Dept Math & Stat, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada::Steiner, Stefan H.@Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Business & Ind Stat Res Grp, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada::MacKay, R.

Variable Selection for Multivariate Statistical Process Control,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2010,22,13,"This article proposes a methodology to select a subset of variables to measure and monitor for multivariate statistical process control (SPC). In contrast with most dimensionality reduction approaches for SPC, we reduce the number of variables that must be measured, thereby reducing the time and cost associated with inspection. We develop a two-stage procedure that selects the variables in a manner that retains as much information on the full set of variables as possible. In the first stage, the variables are sorted according to some measure of information content, which has broad applicability outside of SPC. In the second stage, the selected variables are determined using two alternative tools. The first tool is a general criterion based on the amount of residual information in the nonselected variables. The second tool is based on the performance of the control chart in detecting simulated out-of-control events. We illustrate the usefulness of the approach with simulation results and a real metal-forming application.","Multivariate Statistical Process Control,Principal Variables,Singular Value Decomposition,Variable Selection","PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS,ROTATION,PROFILES,ALARMS,T-2","Gonzalez, Isabel@Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Mech Engn, Madrid 28911, Spain::Sanchez, Ismael@Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Stat, Madrid 28911, Spain","Gonzalez, Isabel@Universidad Carlos III de Madrid::Sanchez, Ismael@Universidad Carlos III de Madrid","Gonzalez Farias, Isabel@L-5327-2014::gonzalez farias, isabel@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4097-3558::SANCHEZ, ISMAEL@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7061-7805","Variable selection and interpretation of covariance principal components+Al-Kandari, NM; Jolliffe, IT+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+2001::Variable selection and interpretation in correlation principal components+Al-Kandari, NM; Jolliffe, IT+ENVIRONMETRICS+SEP 2005::Procrustes rotation in analytical chemistry, a tutorial+Andrade, JM; Gomez-Carracedo, MP; Krzanowski, W; et al.+CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS+JUL 28 2004::DISCARDING OF VARIABLES IN MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+BEALE, EML; KENDALL, MG; MANN, DW+BIOMETRIKA+1967::Statistical process control for geometric specifications: On the monitoring of roundness profiles+Colosimo, Bianca M.; Semeraro, Quirico; Pacella, Massimo+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2008::Dimension reduction via principal variables+Cumming, J.

Control Charts for Poisson Count Data with Varying Sample Sizes,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2010,21,30,Various cumulative sum (CUSUM) and exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control charts have been recommended to monitor a process with Poisson count data when the sample size varies. We evaluate the ability of these CUSUM and EWMA methods in detecting increases in the Poisson rate by calculating the steady-state average run length (ARL) performance for the charts. Our simulation study indicates that the CUSUM chart based on the generalized likelihood-ratio method is best at monitoring Poisson count data at the out-of-control shift for which it is designed when the sample size varies randomly. We also propose a new EWMA method that has good steady-state ARL performance.,"Average Run Length,Cumulative Sum Chart,Exponentially Weighted Moving Average Chart,Statistical Process Control","SURVEILLANCE,EWMA","Ryan, Anne G.@Virginia Tech, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Woodall, William H.@Virginia Tech, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Ryan, Anne G.@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Woodall, William H.@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University",not exist,"Poisson EWMA control charts+Borror, CM; Champ, CW; Rigdon, SE+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 1998::AN EWMA FOR MONITORING A PROCESS STANDARD-DEVIATION+CROWDER, SV; HAMILTON, MD+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 1992::Surveillance strategies for detecting changepoint in incidence rate based on exponentially weighted moving average methods+Dong, Yuping; Hedayat, A.

Moment-Ratio Diagrams for Univariate Distributions,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2010,18,14,"We present two moment-ratio diagrams along with guidance for their interpretation. The first moment-ratio diagram is a graph of skewness versus kurtosis for common univariate probability distributions. The second moment-ratio diagram is a graph of coefficient of variation versus skewness for common univariate probability distributions. Both of these diagrams, to our knowledge, are the most comprehensive to date. The diagrams serve four purposes: (1) they quantify the proximity between various univariate distributions based on their second, third, and fourth moments; (2) they illustrate the versatility of a particular distribution based on the range of values that the various moments can assume; (3) they can be used to create a short list of potential probability models based on a data set; and (4) they clarify the limiting relationships between various well-known distribution families. The use of the moment-ratio diagrams for choosing a distribution that models given data is illustrated.","Coefficient of Variation,Kurtosis,Skewness","BALL-BEARINGS,BURR","Vargo, Erik@Coll William & Mary, Dept Math, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA::Pasupathy, Raghu@Virginia Tech, Grad Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Leemis, Lawrence@Coll William & Mary, Dept Math, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA","Vargo, Erik@William & Mary::Pasupathy, Raghu@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Leemis, Lawrence@William & Mary",not exist,"no title+Billingsley, P.+Probability and Measure+1995::Parametric model discrimination for heavily censored survival data+Block, A.

An Evaluation of a GLR Control Chart for Monitoring the Process Mean,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2010,32,46,"This paper considers the problem of monitoring the mean of a normally distributed process variable when the objective is to effectively detect both small and large shifts in this mean. The performance of a generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) control chart is evaluated, where the likelihood ratio is based on a moving window of past observations. The performance of the GLR chart is compared with the performance of other options, such as combinations of Shewhart and cumulative sum (CUSUM) charts and an adaptive CUSUM chart, that have been proposed for detecting a wide range of shift sizes. Performance is evaluated for sustained shifts, transient shifts, and drifts in the mean. It is shown that the overall performance of the GLR chart is at least as good as these other options. These other options have multiple control-chart parameters that allow for the charts to be tuned to be more sensitive to certain shifts that may be of interest. However, the GLR chart does not require users to specify the values of any control-chart parameters other than the size of the window and the control limit. We recommend a specific window size and provide a table of control limits corresponding to specified values of the false-alarm rate, so it is very easy to design the GLR chart for use in applications. Simulating the performance of the GLR chart is time consuming, but approximating the GLR chart with a set of CUSUM charts provides a much faster way of evaluating the performance of the GLR chart for research purposes.","Adaptive Control Chart,Average Time to Signal,CUSUM Chart,Generalized Likelihood Ratio,Shewhart Chart,Statistical Process Control,Steady State,Surveillance","WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE,STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,CUSUM CONTROL CHART,QUALITY-CONTROL,CONTROL SCHEMES,CHANGE-POINT,SHIFTS,VARIANCE,SYSTEMS,DESIGN","Reynolds, Marion R., Jr.@Virginia Tech, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA@Virginia Tech, Dept Forest Resources & Environm Conservat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Lou, Jianying@Virginia Tech, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Reynolds, Marion R., Jr.@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Lou, Jianying@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University",not exist,"The GLRT for statistical process control of autocorrelated processes+Apley, DW; Shi, J+IIE TRANSACTIONS+SEP 1999::Design of change detection algorithms based on the generalized likelihood ratio test+Capizzi, G+ENVIRONMETRICS+DEC 2001::An adaptive exponentially weighted moving average control chart+Capizzi, G; Masarotto, G+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 2003::SOME OMNIBUS EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE STATISTICAL PROCESS MONITORING SCHEMES+DOMANGUE, R; PATCH, SC+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 1991::The design and analysis of 2-CUSUM procedure+Dragalin, V+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+1997::Sequential change-point detection with likelihood ratios+Gombay, E+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+AUG 15 2000::CUSUM and EWMA multi-charts for detecting a range of mean shifts+Han, Dong; Tsung, Fugee; Hu, Xijian; et al.+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 2007::no title+Hawkins, D.

Optimal Design of a CUSUM Chart for a Mean Shift of Unknown Size,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2010,22,11,"The cumulative sum (CUSUM) control chart is one of the most popular methods used to detect a process mean shift. When one specific size of the mean shift is assumed, the CUSUM chart can be optimally designed in terms of average run length (ARL). In practice, however, the size of the mean shift is usually unknown, and the CUSUM chart can perform poorly when the actual size of the mean shift is significantly different from the assumed size. In this paper, we assign a probability distribution to the size of the mean shift to represent the lack of knowledge of the shift size. We use an ARL-based performance measure, called expected weighted run length (EWRL), and propose a method to optimally design a CUSUM chart based on EWRL. This method can be easily extended to other CUSUM-based control charts, such as weighted CUSUM and multi-CUSUM charts proposed in the literature. The numerical results show that the CUSUM or the CUSUM-based chart can be improved by our proposed method in terms of EWRL.","Multi-CUSUM,Quality-Control Chart Design,Relative Run Length,Statistical Process Control,Unknown Mean Shifts","TAGUCHIS LOSS FUNCTION,OPTIMIZATION DESIGN,CONTROL SCHEMES,EWMA","Hyu, Ong-Hyun@Purdue Univ, Sch Ind Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA::Wan, Hong@Purdue Univ, Sch Ind Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA::Kim, Sujin@Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Singapore 117576, Singapore","Hyu, Ong-Hyun@Purdue University System@Purdue University::Wan, Hong@Purdue University System@Purdue University::Kim, Sujin@National University of Singapore","Ryu, Jong-hyun@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0270-7937","The GLRT for statistical process control of autocorrelated processes+Apley, DW; Shi, J+IIE TRANSACTIONS+SEP 1999::INFLUENCE OF REFERENCE VALUES AND ESTIMATED VARIANCE ON ARL OF CUSUM TESTS+BAGSHAW, M; JOHNSON, RA+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1975::APPROACH TO PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION OF CUSUM RUN LENGTH+BROOK, D; EVANS, DA+BIOMETRIKA+1972::Design of EWMA and CUSUM control charts subject to random shift sizes and quality impacts+Chen, Argon; Chen, Y.

Sensitivity Analysis of Optimal Designs for Accelerated Life Testing,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2010,18,15,"In experimental testing, it is desirable to select combinations of input factors that yield optimal results given an objective specified by a practitioner. Often this objective involves minimizing the uncertainty in a parameter or prediction estimate. To determine the experimental design to achieve such an objective, it is necessary to understand the relationship between the testing variables and the response. Alphabetic optimal designs are commonly used in such applications based largely on the ease of their construction with advanced statistical software. However, many publications cite concerns with the overall robustness of such designs to small departures in parameter estimates. This paper examines the issue of model parameter sensitivity to the selection of an accelerated life test based on the UC-optimality criterion, minimizing of the prediction variance at the usage condition, using a generalized linear model framework. We will examine the trade-off implications of choice of experimental design, sample size, and censoring.","Design of Experiments,Reliability Testing,Robustness,UC-Optimality,Use Condition",,"Monroe, Eric M.@Intel Corp, Chandler, AZ 85226 USA::Pan, Rong@Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA::Anderson-Cook, Christine M.@Los Alamos Natl Lab, Stat Sci Grp, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA::Montgomery, Douglas C.@Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA::Borror, Connie M.@Arizona State Univ, Glendale, AZ 85306 USA","Monroe, Eric M.@Intel Corporation::Pan, Rong@Arizona State University::Anderson-Cook, Christine M.@Los Alamos National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)::Montgomery, Douglas C.@Arizona State University::Borror, Connie M.@Arizona State University",not exist,"The fitting of exponential, Weibull and extreme value distributions to complex censored survival data using GLIM+Aitkin, M.; Clayton, D.+Applied Statistics+1980::Bayesian experimental design: A review+Chaloner, K; Verdinelli, I+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+AUG 1995::Sensitivity analysis and related analyses: A review of some statistical techniques+Kleijnen, JPC+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+1997::no title+Lawless, JF.+Statistical Models and Methods for Lifetime Data+2003::Model-robust factorial designs+Li, W; Nachtsheim, CJ+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 2000::no title+McCullagh, P.; Nelder, J.

These charting procedures, which weight current observations according to the information contained in the fault signature, are able to outperform the previously suggested self-starting charts, which neglect the dynamic pattern of the mean change.","Change-Point Detection,Q-Chart,Recursive Residuals,Statistical Process Control","AVERAGE CONTROL CHART,STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,DYNAMIC MEAN CHANGE,QUALITY-CONTROL,UP PROCESSES,VARIABLES,DESIGN,CUSUM,PARAMETERS,SCHEMES","Capizzi, Giovanna@Univ Padua, Dept Stat Sci, I-35121 Padua, Italy::Masarotto, Guido@Univ Padua, Dept Stat Sci, I-35121 Padua, Italy","Capizzi, Giovanna@University of Padua::Masarotto, Guido@University of Padua",not exist,"An optimal filter design approach to statistical process control+Apley, Daniel W.; Chin, Chang-Ho+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 2007::The GLRT for statistical process control of autocorrelated processes+Apley, DW; Shi, J+IIE TRANSACTIONS+SEP 1999::no title+Basseville, M; Nikiforov, I.+Detection of Abrupt Changes: Theory and Applications+1993::Cumulative score charts+Box, GEP; Ramirez, J.+Quality and Reliability Engineering International+1992::TECHNIQUES FOR TESTING CONSTANCY OF REGRESSION RELATIONSHIPS OVER TIME+BROWN, RL; DURBIN, J; EVANS, JM+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1975::An adaptive exponentially weighted moving average control chart+Capizzi, G; Masarotto, G+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 2003::Properties of the T-2 control chart when parameters are estimated+Champ, CW; Jones-Farmer, LA; Rigdon, SE+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 2005::Optimal design of second-order linear filters for control charting+Chin, Chang-Ho; Apley, Daniel W.+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 2006::Comparison of the cuscore, GLRT and cusum control charts for detecting a dynamic mean change+Han, D; Tsung, F+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+SEP 2005::A reference-free Cuscore chart for dynamic mean change detection and a unified framework for charting performance comparison+Han, D; Tsung, FG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2006::REGRESSION ADJUSTMENT FOR VARIABLES IN MULTIVARIATE QUALITY-CONTROL+HAWKINS, DM+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1993::SELF-STARTING CUSUM CHARTS FOR LOCATION AND SCALE+HAWKINS, DM+STATISTICIAN+1987::MULTIVARIATE QUALITY-CONTROL BASED ON REGRESSION-ADJUSTED VARIABLES+HAWKINS, DM+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1991::Self-starting multivariate exponentially weighted moving average control charting+Hawkins, Douglas M.; Maboudou-Tchao, Edgard M.+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 2007::no title+HOLMES DS+QUAL ENG+1993::Change patterns of time series-based control charts+Hu, SJ; Roan, C+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1996::Effects of parameter estimation on control chart properties: A literature review+Jensen, Willis A.; Jones-Farmer, L.

Assessment of a Binary Measurement System in Current Use,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2010,19,19,"Binary measurement systems that classify parts as pass or fail are widely used in industry, especially for systematic inspection in high-volume processes. In this context, we are likely to have available a large number of previously measured passed and failed parts. To support production and quality improvement, it is important to assess the misclassification rates, e.g., the probability of failing a conforming part or passing a nonconforming part. We may also want to estimate the unknown conforming rate. Here we focus on the assessment of a binary measurement system when no gold-standard measurement system is available. The standard assessment plan is to repeatedly measure a sample of parts and use a latent class model. We demonstrate the substantial benefit of supplementing the standard plan with the available data from the previously measured parts. We propose new sampling plans and compare them with the standard plan with respect to the precision of the estimators of the misclassification rates.

A Nonparametric Change-Point Control Chart,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2010,29,58,"The assumption of fully known in-control distributions has long been recognized as an idealization, at best approximately true. Recent development of normal-based change-point methods has allowed the assumption of exactly known in-control mean and variance to be relaxed, but retained the assumption of normality. In this paper, we develop a nonparametric tool based on the change-point model for statistical process control. This method is shown to perform well, even beating the parametric approach for small to moderate shifts in normal data, and to involve relatively light computation.","Chart Performance,Cumulative Methods,Rank Sum Test","STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,ESTIMATED PARAMETERS,LOCATION,SEQUENCE,RANKS,CUSUM,MODEL","Hawkins, Douglas M.@Univ Minnesota, Sch Stat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA::Deng, Qiqi@Univ Minnesota, Sch Stat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Hawkins, Douglas M.@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities::Deng, Qiqi@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities",not exist,"A NONPARAMETRIC EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE CONTROL SCHEME+AMIN, RW; SEARCY, AJ+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+1991::NONPARAMETRIC QUALITY-CONTROL CHARTS BASED ON THE SIGN STATISTIC+AMIN, RW; REYNOLDS, MR; BAKIR, S+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1995::NONPARAMETRIC PROCEDURE FOR PROCESS-CONTROL BASED ON WITHIN-GROUP RANKING+BAKIR, ST; REYNOLDS, MR+TECHNOMETRICS+1979::Nonparametric control charts: An overview and some results+Chakraborti, S; Van der Laan, P; Bakir, ST+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 2001::no title+Conover, WJ.+Practical non-parametric statistics+1999::no title+CSORGO M+LTD THEOREMS CHANGE+1997::no title+DENG Q+THESIS U MINNESOTA+2009::A CONTROL CHART BASED ON RANKS+HACKL, P; LEDOLTER, J+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 1991::The changepoint model for statistical process control+Hawkins, DM; Qiu, PH; Kang, CW+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 2003::TESTING A SEQUENCE OF OBSERVATIONS FOR A SHIFT IN LOCATION+HAWKINS, DM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1977::INFERENCE ABOUT CHANGE-POINT IN A SEQUENCE OF RANDOM VARIABLES+HINKLEY, DV+BIOMETRIKA+1970::no title+IRVINE JM+THESIS YALE U+1982::no title+JANACEK GJ+STATISTICIAN+1997::Effects of parameter estimation on control chart properties: A literature review+Jensen, Willis A.; Jones-Farmer, L.

Likelihood Ratio-Based Distribution-Free EWMA Control Charts,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2010,47,58,"Nonparametric or distribution-free charts are useful in statistical process control when there is a lack of or limited knowledge about the underlying process distribution. Most existing approaches in the literature are for monitoring location parameters. They may not be effective with a change of distribution over time in many applications. This paper develops a new distribution-free control chart based on the integration of a powerful nonparametric goodness-of-fit test and the exponentially weighted moving-average (EWMA) control scheme. Benefiting from certain desirable properties of the test and the proposed charting statistic, our proposed control chart is computationally fast, convenient to use, and efficient in detecting potential shifts in location, scale, and shape. Thus, it offers robust protection against variation in various underlying distributions. Numerical studies and a real-data example show that the proposed approaches are quite effective in industrial applications, particularly in start-up and short-run situations.","Anderson-Darling Test,Change Point,Goodness of Fit,Self-Starting,Statistical Process Control,Weighted Empirical Distribution","WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE,NONPARAMETRIC CONTROL CHARTS,STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,QUALITY-CONTROL,CUSUM PROCEDURE,2-SAMPLE TESTS,CHANGE-POINT,NONNORMALITY,ROBUSTNESS,SHIFTS","Zou, Changliang@Nankai Univ, LPMC, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China@Nankai Univ, Sch Math Sci, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China::Tsung, Fugee@Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Logist Management, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Zou, Changliang@Nankai University::Tsung, Fugee@Hong Kong University of Science & Technology",not exist,"Empirical non-parametric control charts: Estimation effects and corrections+Albers, W; Kallenberg, WCM+JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS+APR 2004::DISTRIBUTION OF 2-SAMPLE CRAMER-VON MISES CRITERION+ANDERSON, TW+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1962::Distribution-free quality control charts based on signed-rank-like statistics+Bakir, ST+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2006::A distribution-free shewhart quality control chart based on signed-ranks+Bakir, ST.+Qual Eng+2004::NONPARAMETRIC PROCEDURE FOR PROCESS-CONTROL BASED ON WITHIN-GROUP RANKING+BAKIR, ST; REYNOLDS, MR+TECHNOMETRICS+1979::Robustness of the EWMA control chart to non-normality+Borror, CM; Montgomery, DC; Runger, GC+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1999::An adaptive exponentially weighted moving average control chart+Capizzi, G; Masarotto, G+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 2003::A phase II nonparametric control chart based on precedence statistics with runs-type signaling rules+Chakraborti, S.; Eryilmaz, S.; Human, S.

Optimum Designs Versus Orthogonal Arrays for Main Effects and Two-Factor Interactions,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2010,16,4,"Designs with full estimation capacity permit estimation of all main effects and all two-factor interactions. By allowing correlation among the effects, the run size of such designs can be smaller than required for a resolution of 5. To construct a design, one can either use commercial software for designs with optimized D-efficiencies or a catalog of orthogonal arrays. In the context of a wood construction experiment, we discuss how to choose between these approaches. We enumerate mixed-level and multilevel resolution-4 designs with run size up to 72 and with the maximum number of factors compatible with a full estimation capacity. Algorithmically constructed benchmark designs were generated with commercial software.

Nonparametric CUSUM and EWMA Control Charts for Detecting Mean Shifts,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2010,32,47,"Nonparametric control charts are useful when the underlying process distribution is not likely to be normal or is unknown. In this paper, we propose two nonparametric analogs of the CUSUM and EWMA control charts based on the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for detecting process mean shifts. We first derive the run-length distributions of the proposed control charts and then compare the performance of the proposed nonparametric charts to (1) CUSUM and EWMA control charts on subgroup means and (2) the median chart and the Shewhart-type nonparametric control chart based on Mann Whitney test. We show that the charts proposed herein perform well in detecting step mean shifts and perform almost the same as the parametric counterparts when the underlying process output follows a normal distribution and better when the output is nonnormal. We also study the effect of the reference sample size and the subgroup size on the performance of the proposed charts. A numerical example is also given as an illustration of the design and implementation of the proposed charts.","Distribution-Free Control Charts,Quality Control,Run-Length Distribution,Statistical Process Control,Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test","ESTIMATED PARAMETERS,RUN-LENGTH,NONNORMALITY,PERFORMANCE,ROBUSTNESS,DESIGN,RANKS","Li, Su-Yi@Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Singapore 117576, Singapore::Tang, Loon-Ching@Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Singapore 117576, Singapore::Ng, Szu-Hui@Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Singapore 117576, Singapore","Li, Su-Yi@National University of Singapore::Tang, Loon-Ching@National University of Singapore::Ng, Szu-Hui@National University of Singapore",not exist,"A NONPARAMETRIC EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE CONTROL SCHEME+AMIN, RW; SEARCY, AJ+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+1991::NONPARAMETRIC QUALITY-CONTROL CHARTS BASED ON THE SIGN STATISTIC+AMIN, RW; REYNOLDS, MR; BAKIR, S+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1995::Nonparametric predictive inference in statistical process control+Arts, G.R.J.; Coolen, F.P.A.; van der Laan, P.+Qual.

Generating and Assessing Exact G-Optimal Designs,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2010,39,12,"We introduce a new algorithm for generating near G optimal designs for second-order models over cuboidal regions. The algorithm involves the use of Brent's minimization algorithm with coordinate exchange to create designs for 2 to 5 factors. Designs created using this new method either match or exceed the G-efficiency of previously reported designs. We also introduce a new graphical tool, the variance ratio fraction of design space (VRFDS) plot, which is useful for easy comparison of the prediction variance for competing designs over a given region of interest. Using the VRFDS plot to compare C optimal designs to I-optimal designs shows that the G-optimal designs have higher prediction variance over the vast majority of the design region. This suggests that, for many response surface studies, G-optimal designs may not be the best choice.","Computer-Generated Designs,D-Efficiency,Fraction of Design Space Plots,G-Efficiency,I-Efficiency,Optimality Criteria,Prediction Variance","RESPONSE-SURFACE DESIGNS,PREDICTION-VARIANCE PROPERTIES,GENETIC ALGORITHM APPROACH,NOISE VARIABLES,CONSTRUCTION,CAPABILITY,FACTORIAL,CRITERION,FRACTION,MIXTURE","Rodriguez, Myrta@Tecnol Monterrey CSN, Engn & Architecture Dept, Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico::Jones, Bradley@SAS Inst, JMP Div, Cary, NC 27513 USA::Borror, Connie M.@Arizona State Univ W, Div Math & Nat Sci, Phoenix, AZ 85069 USA::Montgomery, Douglas C.@Arizona State Univ, Dept Ind Syst & Operat Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Rodriguez, Myrta@Tecnologico de Monterrey::Jones, Bradley@Unknow::Borror, Connie M.@Arizona State University::Montgomery, Douglas C.@Arizona State University",not exist,"no title+ACKERMANN EC+AM MATH MONTHLY+1985::DEVELOPMENTS IN THE DESIGN OF EXPERIMENTS+ATKINSON, AC+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+1982::OPTIMAL AND EFFICIENT DESIGNS OF EXPERIMENTS+ATWOOD, CL+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1969::Using a genetic algorithm to generate small exact response surface designs+Borkowski, J.J.+J.

Determining Statistical Process Control Baseline Periods in Long Historical Data Streams,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2010,27,13,"In statistical process control (SPC), models are built from baseline data that are observations during successful production. Often the baseline data has to be extracted from a long steam of historical data that includes observations from both successful and unsuccessful productions. Baseline periods have to be identified correctly to ensure that the SPC models are correct and, subsequently, the on-line monitoring based on these models is effective.

This paper proposes a new method to identify baseline periods in a long historical dataset. The method identifies baseline periods where the quality is good, the quality variable has a stable distribution, and the time intervals are sufficiently long. The proposed method is tested on a real dataset from a melting process and yields a baseline that is considered reasonable and convincing to the process engineers. Simulation experiments also show that the proposed method is robust to the distribution of the quality variable by consistently identifying correct baseline periods across different distributions. In contrast, two existing methods of change-point identification are very sensitive to distribution assumptions.","Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering,Baseline,Change-Point Identification,Cluster Analysis,Data Mining,Likelihood Ratio Test,Statistical Process Control","MULTIPLE CHANGE-POINTS,INDIVIDUAL OBSERVATIONS,CLUSTERS,NUMBER,SEQUENCE,MODEL","Zhang, Hang@Arizona State Univ, Harrington Dept Bioengn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA::Albin, Susan L.@Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA::Wagner, Steven R.@Corning Inc, Harrodsburg, KY 40330 USA::Nolet, Daniel A.@Corning Inc, Harrodsburg, KY 40330 USA::Gupta, Suhail@PMA Consaltants, Newark, NJ 07102 USA","Zhang, Hang@Arizona State University::Albin, Susan L.@Rutgers State University New Brunswick::Wagner, Steven R.@State University of New York (SUNY) System@Corning Inc::Nolet, Daniel A.@State University of New York (SUNY) System@Corning Inc::Gupta, Suhail@Unknow",not exist,"no title+BESTERFIELD C+TOTAL QUALITY MANAGE+1999::Estimating the number of clusters in multivariate data by self-organizing maps.+Costa, J A; Netto, M L+International journal of neural systems+1999-Jun::Looking for natural patterns in data - Part 1.

Simultaneous Identification of Premodeled and Unmodeled Variation Patterns,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2010,25,6,"For purposes of identifying root causes of variation in multivariate manufacturing data, many studies employ a linear structured model. One paradigm involves modeling off-line a set of variation patterns and then attempting to detect the presence or absence of those specific premodeled patterns in a sample of on-line data. In another paradigm, which requires no premodeling, the objective is to discover the nature of any variation patterns that are present, based only on the on-line data sample. In this paper, we present a method that combines the two paradigms and mitigates some of the shortcomings of each. Instead of exhaustively premodeling all potential variation patterns, which is infeasible for many processes, one premodels only the patterns for which modeling is relatively easy. The characteristics of any unmodeled patterns that also happen to be present in the on-line data are discovered automatically, and they are treated in such a manner that their presence does not adversely affect the detection of the premodeled patterns. We illustrate the approach with an example from autobody assembly.","Blind Source Separation,Factor Analysis,Independent Components Analysis,Manufacturing Variation Reduction,Multivariate Statistical Process Control","MULTIVARIATE MANUFACTURING PROCESSES,PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS,ASSEMBLY PROCESSES,FAULT-DIAGNOSIS,SEPARATION,DIAGNOSABILITY,STATISTICS,2ND-ORDER","Apley, Daniel W.@Northwestern Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Management Sci, Evanston, IL 60208 USA::Lee, Ho Young@Samsung, Seoul, South Korea","Apley, Daniel W.@Northwestern University::Lee, Ho Young@Unknow","Apley, Daniel@B-7454-2009","Identifying and visualizing nonlinear variation patterns in multivariate manufacturing data+Apley, Daniel W.; Zhang, Feng+IIE TRANSACTIONS+JUN 2007::A, characterization of diagnosability conditions for variance components analysis in assembly operations+Apley, DW; Ding, Y+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING+APR 2005::Diagnosis of multiple fixture faults in panel assembly+Apley, DW; Shi, J+JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME+NOV 1998::Identifying spatial variation patterns in multivariate manufacturing processes: A blind separation approach+Apley, DW; Lee, HY+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 2003::A factor-analysis method for diagnosing variability in multivariate manufacturing processes+Apley, DW; Shi, JJ+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 2001::Process-oriented basis representations for multivariate process diagnostics+Barton, R.R.; Gonzalez-Barreto, D.R.+Quality Engineering+1996-1997::A blind source separation technique using second-order statistics+Belouchrani, A; AbedMeraim, K; Cardoso, JF; et al.+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING+FEB 1997::no title+Box, G.; Jenkins, G.; Reinsel, G.+TIME SERIES ANAL FOR+1994::BLIND BEAMFORMING FOR NON-GAUSSIAN SIGNALS+CARDOSO, JF; SOULOUMIAC, A+IEE PROCEEDINGS-F RADAR AND SIGNAL PROCESSING+DEC 1993::Blind signal separation: Statistical principles+Cardoso, JF+PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE+OCT 1998::INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS, A NEW CONCEPT+COMON, P+SIGNAL PROCESSING+APR 1994::no title+CRUCESALVAREZ SA+4 INT S IND COMP AN+2003::Guidelines for placing additional sensors to improve variation diagnosis in assembly processes+Ding, Y.; Apley, D.

A Bayesian Model-Averaging Approach for Multiple-Response Optimization,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2010,42,15,"The characteristics that define the quality and reliability of many products and processes are often multidimensional. Many of the current multiple-response optimization approaches assume a single-response model to optimize such processes and do not consider the correlations among the response data, the uncertainty in the response models, and the uncertainty in the parameter estimates of the models. Failure to account for these uncertainties can result in misleading quality estimates and therefore poor process design. In this paper, we consider a Bayesian decision theoretic approach to the modeling and optimization of multiple-response systems. This approach naturally accounts for the correlations among the responses, the variability of the predictions, and the uncertainty of the model parameters. We further propose a Bayesian model averaging approach to account for response-model uncertainty. This approach is general and enables the consideration of many types of quality criteria and characteristics. In addition, we also consider the important follow-up question of how to allocate further resources for additional experimentation to achieve or improve on the desired quality level.","Decision Theoretic Approach,Follow-Up Sampling,Optimal Design,Preposterior Analysis,Quality Loss Functions","ROBUST PROCESS OPTIMIZATION,VARIABLE SELECTION,SURFACE OPTIMIZATION,EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGNS,REGRESSION-MODELS,PROBABILITIES","Ng, Szu Hui@Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Singapore 117548, Singapore","Ng, Szu Hui@National University of Singapore",not exist,"no title+Atkinson, A.C.; Donev, A.N.+Optimum Experimental Designs+1992::Posterior probabilities and experimental designs for discriminating between regression models - Discussion+Atkinson, AC+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1996::no title+Berger, J.+Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis+1985::no title+Brown, P.

An Adaptive CUSUM Procedure for Signaling Process Variance Changes of Unknown Sizes,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2010,25,8,"Similar to the CUSUM location chart, the traditional CUSUM dispersion chart can be designed to optimize the detection of specified variance changes. However, this optimality property requires that the magnitude of the out-of-control variance is known exactly a priori. To get away from this requirement, this paper suggests an adaptive CUSUM procedure for signaling changes in the process variance of unknown sizes. The basic idea is to first estimate the current process variance and then dynamically adjust the CUSUM chart to match the variance estimate. A two-dimensional Markov chain model is developed to analyze the chart performance. The comparison results with the traditional CUSUM dispersion chart and other competitive procedures favor the proposed one.","Change-Point Detection,Dispersion Chart,Markov Chain,Statistical Process Control","MONITORING PROCESS DISPERSION,STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,CONTROL CHARTS,WARNING LINES,MODEL,VARIABILITY,SHIFTS","Shu, Lianjie@Univ Macau, Fac Business Adm, Taipa, Peoples R China::Yeung, Hang-Fai@Univ Macau, Fac Business Adm, Taipa, Peoples R China::Jiang, Wei@Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Logist Management, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Shu, Lianjie@University of Macau::Yeung, Hang-Fai@University of Macau::Jiang, Wei@Hong Kong University of Science & Technology","Shu, Lianjie@B-7911-2016","A comparison of control charting procedures for monitoring process dispersion+Acosta-Mejia, CA; Pignatiello, JJ; Rao, BV+IIE TRANSACTIONS+JUN 1999::Monitoring reduction in variability with the range+Acosta-Mejia, CA+IIE TRANSACTIONS+JUN 1998::Monitoring process dispersion without subgrouping+Acosta-Mejia, CA; Pignatiello, JJ+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 2000::no title+BASSEVILLE TA+DETECTION ABRUPT CHA+1993::APPROACH TO PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION OF CUSUM RUN LENGTH+BROOK, D; EVANS, DA+BIOMETRIKA+1972::INFECTION OF HORSES BY TYZZERS BACILLUS+CHANTER, N+EQUINE VETERINARY JOURNAL+JAN 1995::no title+Hawkins, D.

We evaluate several computer experiments assuming the modeler is interested in fitting a high-order polynomial to the response data considering both optimal and space-filling designs.

Planning and Inference for a Sequential Accelerated Life Test,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2010,28,18,"In planning accelerated life tests (ALTs), initial values of some unknown model parameters must be specified so as to derive a locally optimal test plan. Very often, the margin of specification error is high and the requisite level of statistical precision cannot be achieved as planned. In this paper, we propose a sequential test plan for single-variable constant-stress accelerated life test. Under the sequential scheme, a test at the highest stress level is first planned and conducted. Using the information obtained at the highest stress level, a Bayesian framework is proposed to optimally determine both the sample allocation and stress combinations at lower stress levels of subsequent accelerated tests. This is done by minimizing the preposterior expectation of the posterior variance of the estimated life percentile of interest at use conditions. For illustration purposes, the proposed scheme is applied to ALTs with two and three constant stress levels and a comprehensive simulation study is presented to compare the performance of the sequential ALT with that of nonsequential static testing.

Statistical Adjustments to Engineering Models,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2009,22,36,"Statistical models are commonly used in quality-improvement studies. However, such models tend to perform poorly when predictions are made away from the observed data points. On the other hand, engineering models derived using the underlying physics of the process do not always match satisfactorily with reality. This article proposes engineering-statistical models that overcome the disadvantages of engineering models and statistical models. The engineering-statistical model is obtained through some adjustments to the engineering model using experimental data. The adjustments are done in a sequential way and are based on empirical Bayes methods. We also develop approximate frequentist procedures for adjustments that are computationally much easier to implement. The usefulness of the methodology is illustrated using a problem of predicting surface roughness in a microcutting process and the optimization of a spot-welding process.","Bayesian Methods,Calibration,Computer Experiments,Gaussian Process,Prediction,Semi-Empirical Models,Validation","COMPUTER-MODELS,CALIBRATION,PREDICTION","Joseph, V.

Improved Measurement-System Assessment for Processes with 100% Inspection,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2009,9,7,"We consider the assessment of an automated continuous measurement system used for 100% inspection in a high-volume manufacturing process. Because of the automation, we assume that there are no operator effects. If the system stores the measured values, we effectively know the current process mean and standard deviation. Because of the high volume, we have parts available with values spread across the whole distribution.

The standard plan for measurement-system assessment is to select k parts at random from the process and measure each of the selected parts n times. We then estimate the repeatability of the system using ANOVA. We propose two improvements. First, we demonstrate the substantial value of using the known process characteristics in the analysis. Second, we describe an alternative sampling plan where we deliberately select parts with extreme values from the population of measured parts to remeasure. We call this selection leveraging. We discuss the analysis of the leveraged plan and show that it is more efficient than the standard plan. We also discuss the planning and implementation of a leveraged assessment study and some associated issues and extensions.","Components of Variation,Gauge R&R,Leveraging,Measurement System Assessment,Sample Size Determination",RELIABILITY,"Browne, Ryan P.@Univ Waterloo, Business & Ind Stat Res Grp, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada::Mackay, R.

CUSUM Monitoring of First-Order Integer-Valued Autoregressive Processes of Poisson Counts,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2009,27,21,"Attributes control charts for counts generally assume that the process being monitored is independent and identically distributed in its in-control state. However, violation of this assumption in practice may significantly degrade a chart's performance and usefulness if the autocorrelation structure is not taken into account. To describe the autocorrelation structure of counts in an in-control process, integer-valued autoregressive moving average process models can be employed. This paper investigates the cumulative sum (CUSUM) control chart for monitoring autocorrelated processes of counts modeled by a Poisson integer-valued autoregressive model of order 1, namely Poisson INAR(14). The CUSUM chart is designed to detect assignable causes affecting the process mean, but also changes in the autocorrelation structure are considered. Exact numerical results obtained through a bivariate Markov chain approach are provided for sustained shifts in any or both of these process parameters. Some numerical results from a simulation study of the residuals' monitoring are also presented. It is shown that the considered CUSUM chart of observations has good overall performance in detecting assignable causes in autocorrelated count processes.","Autocorrelation,CUSUM Control Chart,Exact ARL Computation,Markov Chain,Poisson INAR(1) Model","AVERAGE RUN LENGTHS,CONTROL CHARTS,TIME-SERIES,CONTROL SCHEMES,RESIDUALS,MODELS","Weiss, Christian H.@Univ Wurzburg, Dept Stat, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany::Testik, Murat Caner@Hacettepe Univ, Dept Ind Engn, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey","Weiss, Christian H.@University of Wurzburg::Testik, Murat Caner@Hacettepe University","TESTIK, MURAT@G-6133-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2389-4759","First order integer valued autoregressive (INAR(l)) process+Al-Osh, M.

A CUSUM Chart for Monitoring a Proportion with Autocorrelated Binary Observations,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2009,23,25,"When traditional control charts are used to monitor a proportion p, it is assumed that the binary observations are independent. This paper investigates the problem of monitoring p when there is a continuous stream of autocorrelated binary observations that follow a two-state Markov chain model with first-order dependence. It is shown that both the Shewhart p-chart and the most efficient chart for independent observations, the Bernoulli CUSUM chart, are not robust to autocorrelation, and that adjusting the control limits of these traditional charts to account for the autocorrelation is not an efficient approach. Here we construct a Markov binary CUSUM (MBCUSUM) chart based on a log-likelihood-ratio statistic and show that this chart can be well approximated by using a Markov chain model, for which exact properties are calculable. Numerical results show that the MBCUSUM chart will detect most increases in p faster than competing charts. The effect of the size of the Phase I data set used in setting up the MBCUSUM chart is also investigated.","Bernoulli CUSUM,Binary Data,Estimating Process Parameters,Markov Chain,Phase I Sample Size,Surveillance","RUN-LENGTH,INSPECTION,SURVEILLANCE","Mousavi, Shabnam@Georgia State Univ, Robinson Coll Business, Dept Finance, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA@Max Planck Inst Human Dev, D-14195 Berlin, Germany::Reynolds, Marion R., Jr.@Virginia Tech, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA@Virginia Tech, Dept Forestry, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Mousavi, Shabnam@Max Planck Society@University System of Georgia@Georgia State University::Reynolds, Marion R., Jr.@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University",not exist,"THE PROBLEM OF MISPLACED CONTROL LIMITS+ALWAN, LC; ROBERTS, HV+APPLIED STATISTICS-JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C+1995::no title+Bhat, N.+Elements of applied stochastic processes+1984::ATTRIBUTE CONTROL CHARTS FOR MARKOV DEPENDENT PRODUCTION PROCESSES+BHAT, UN; LAL, R+IIE TRANSACTIONS+JUN 1990::A Shewhart control chart under 100% inspection for Markov dependent attribute data+Blatterman, DK; Champ, CW.+P 23 ANN MOD SIM C P+1992::DETECTING A SHIFT IN FRACTION NONCONFORMING USING RUN-LENGTH CONTROL CHARTS WITH 100-PERCENT INSPECTION+BOURKE, PD+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1991::THE INSPECTION OF A MARKOV PROCESS+BROADBENT, SR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1958::APPROACH TO PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION OF CUSUM RUN LENGTH+BROOK, D; EVANS, DA+BIOMETRIKA+1972::A CUSUM quality control chart under 100% inspection for Markov dependent attribute data+Champ, CW; Blatterman, DK; Rigdon, SE.+P 3 IND ENG RES C AT+1994::SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM FOR CONGENITAL-MALFORMATIONS+CHEN, R+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1978::Dependence bias in conventional p-charts and its correction with an approximate lot quality distribution+Deligonul, Z.

Combined Charts for Mean and Variance Information,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2009,15,26,"Since the earliest days of statistical process control, it has been recognized that it is essential to monitor both mean and variability and to sound an alarm if either of these characteristics shows sign of a special cause. Traditionally, this has been done by using separate (X) over bar and S charts, with the implication that if either chart exceeds its control limit action will be taken to diagnose and resolve any special causes.

It is, however, possible to monitor both mean and variance in a single chart responsive to shifts in either, and several proposals along these lines have been published. Two new combination charts are proposed, and it is shown that, in addition to the simplicity of a single chart rather than two, a combination chart may have significant performance advantages over the, (X) over bar and S chart pair.

Good practice augments the traditional Shewhart charts with cumulative sum or exponentially weighted moving average charts for location and for scale; these pairs may also be replaced by combination charts.","Fisher Methods,Likelihood Ratio,Shewhart Control Charts","WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE,CUMULATIVE SUM CHARTS","Hawkins, Douglas M.@Univ Minnesota, Sch Stat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA::Deng, Qiqi@Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceut Inc, Ridgefield, CT 06877 USA","Hawkins, Douglas M.@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities::Deng, Qiqi@Boehringer Ingelheim",not exist,"Semicircle control chart for variables data+Chao, M.T.; Cheng, S.W.+Quality Engineering+1996::Max chart: Combining X-bar chart and S chart+Chen, GM; Cheng, SW+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 1998::Single variables control charts: an overview+Cheng, Smiley W.; Thaga, Keoagile+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+NOV 2006::SOME OMNIBUS EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE STATISTICAL PROCESS MONITORING SCHEMES+DOMANGUE, R; PATCH, SC+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 1991::no title+Hawkins, D.

Nonrepeatable Gauge R&R Studies Assuming Temporal or Patterned Object Variation,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2009,13,6,"The standard method to assess a measurement system's precision is a gauge repeatability and reproducibility (gauge R&R) study. It exploits replications to estimate variance components that are interpreted as measurement spread. For nonrepeatable measurements, it is not feasible to obtain replications because objects are destroyed when they are measured or because the object changes over time. Possible solutions are to replace replications with measurements of multiple objects or with the measurement of one object at multiple times. Subsequently, these measurements are modeled by a fixed pattern (over time or over positions). We show that the experimental design used in this type of nonrepeatable gauge R&R studies is best constructed in a way that is similar to a Latin square design. These designs have a great flexibility, can be applied in many situations encountered in practice, and have nice mathematical properties as well. We consider several examples in which this approach is applied and worked out. For the examples given, we provide the analysis and the results following the worked-out approach. Analysis of the envisaged experimental set-up is done with linear and nonlinear mixed models in which variance components are estimated by restricted maximum-likelihood estimators.","Latin-Square Experimental Design,Measurement Error,Nonlinear Mixed Model,Restricted Maximum Likelihood,Variance Components",VARIABILITY,"van der Meulen, Frank@Delft Univ Technol, NL-2628 CD Delft, Netherlands::de Koning, Henk@AT Kearney, NL-1181 LE Amstelveen, Netherlands::de Mast, Jeroen@Univ Amsterdam, IBIS, NL-1018 TV Amsterdam, Netherlands","van der Meulen, Frank@Delft University of Technology::de Koning, Henk@Unknow::de Mast, Jeroen@University of Amsterdam","De Mast, Jeroen@A-6836-2011::van der Meulen, Frank@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7246-8612","A review of methods for measurement systems capability analysis+Burdick, RK; Borror, CM; Montgomery, DC+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 2003::Confidence intervals on measures of variability in R&amp;R studies+Burdick, RK; Larsen, GA+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1997::no title+Cochran, WG; Cox, GM.+Experimental designs+1957::no title+Davidian, M.; Giltinan, D.

Using Shewhart and CUSUM Charts for Diagnosis with Count Data in a Vendor Certification Study,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2009,17,5,"Problem: We present a case study concerned with the problem of reducing errors by vendors who process credit card applications for a large credit card bank. More specifically, we show the results of a process performance evaluation and process capability analysis that was used to help identify and solve the problem of excess variability. These tasks are sometimes called Phase I studies. We conclude with a discussion of implications for process monitoring and subsequent process improvements, sometimes called Phase II studies.

Approach: Quality of the credit card processing task was measured with count data and the counts were low; this is typical of many service operations today. Our approach was to use sequence plots and CUSUM sequence plots of the data and Shewhart np and CUSUM control charts to explore the count data drawn from the four vendors that process credit card applications for this bank, We found that using both Shewhart and CUSUM methods helped us to better accomplish the Phase I study.

Results: The results of our analysis indicated differences in quality between vendors and within vendors over time. Subsequent analysis showed that the differences were related directly to training and workers' experience. Two interventions were made subsequent to the process capability analysis; these were improved training and interventions to reduce turnover.","Capability Analysis,Performance Evaluation,Phase I Studies,Quality Improvement","PROPORTION,DESIGN","Saniga, Erwin M.@Univ Delaware, Lerner Coll Business & Econ, Newark, DE 19716 USA::Davis, Darwin J.@Univ Delaware, Lerner Coll Business & Econ, Newark, DE 19716 USA::Lucas, James M.@JM Lucas & Associates, Wilmington, DE USA","Saniga, Erwin M.@University of Delaware::Davis, Darwin J.@University of Delaware::Lucas, James M.@Unknow","Davis, Darwin@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4489-4590","Improved p charts to monitor process quality+Acosta-Mejia, CA+IIE TRANSACTIONS+JUN 1999::Effectiveness of training in organizations: A meta-analysis of design and evaluation features+Arthur, W; Bennett, W; Edens, PS; et al.+JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY+APR 2003::Sample size and the Binomial CUSUM Control Chart: the case of 100% inspection+Bourke, PD+METRIKA+2001::no title+GAN FF+J APPL STAT+1993::no title+Hawkins, D.

Bayesian Variable Selection for Fractional Factorial Experiments with Multilevel Categorical Factors,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2009,28,3,"Fractional factorial experiments are an exceedingly important tool to the scientist or engineer working in virtually any sector of industry. As was first demonstrated by Box and Meyer (1993), what has become known as the Bayesian variable-selection approach is a useful addition to the traditional analysis techniques, due to its ability to identify ""difficult-to-spot"" interaction effects in experiments with complex aliasing. However, the published experiments on which this approach has been applied consist either of two-level factors or factors with quantitative levels. A multilevel categorical factor differs in that its effect must be represented by more than one parameter in the model, these being the regression coefficients associated with a set of dummy variables. Regardless of how the dummy variables are selected, it is not reasonable to assume that these parameters are exchangeable either among themselves or between parameters representing the effect of other factors. Hence, the priors proposed to date cannot be used. We present a simple multivariate normal prior for this effect that is a natural extension of the prior used by previous authors for two-level factors and demonstrate its effectiveness by reanalyzing two multilevel factorial experiments with very complex aliasing.","Complex Aliasing,Interactions,Markov Chain Monte Carlo,Screening Experiments,Semiautomatic Priors,Stochastic Search,WinBUGS","DESIGNED EXPERIMENTS,MODEL","Woodward, Phil@Pfizer Global Res & Dev, Dept Stat, Sandwich CT13 9NJ, Kent, England::Walley, Rosalind@Pfizer Global Res & Dev, Dept Stat, Sandwich CT13 9NJ, Kent, England","Woodward, Phil@Pfizer::Walley, Rosalind@Pfizer",not exist,"FINDING THE ACTIVE FACTORS IN FRACTIONATED SCREENING EXPERIMENTS+BOX, GEP; MEYER, RD+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 1993::AN ANALYSIS FOR UNREPLICATED FRACTIONAL FACTORIALS+BOX, GEP; MEYER, RD+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1986::Bayesian variable selection with related predictors+Chipman, H+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+MAR 1996::A Bayesian variable-selection approach for analyzing designed experiments with complex aliasing+Chipman, H; Hamada, M; Wu, CFJ+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1997::Use of half-normal plots in interpreting factorial two level experiments+Daniel, C.+Technometrics+1959::Analysis of an experiment aimed at improving the reliability of transmission centre shafts.+Davis, T P+Lifetime data analysis+1995::no title+DOBSON AJ+INTRO STAT MODELLING+1988::ASSESSMENT AND PROPAGATION OF MODEL UNCERTAINTY+DRAPER, D+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1995::no title+Draper, NR; Smith, H.+Applied regression analysis+1981::no title+FFRNANDEZ C+J ECONOMETRICS+2001::no title+Gelman, A.; Carlin, J.

Effect of Not Having Homogeneous Test Units in Accelerated Life Tests,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2009,11,8,"In accelerated life tests (ALTs), test units are run at higher stress levels in order to experience more failures. A Weibull regression model can, in this case, be used to infer failure behavior at the normal stress level. In practice, statistical analyses usually do not take batch differences into account even when they are present. To correctly include batch differences in the analysis, one needs to use a regression model with random effects. In this paper, we use such a model to show that ignoring batch differences in modeling can result in overly precise estimates of quantiles and probabilities of failure at the normal stress level, as well as overly precise predictions of the failure time for a new unit at the normal stress level.","Bayesian Analysis,Credibility Interval,Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC),Prediction Interval,Quantile",,"Leon, Ramon V.@Univ Tennessee, Dept Stat Operat & Management Sci, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA::Li, Yanzhen@Univ Tennessee, Dept Ind & Informat Engn, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA::Guess, Frank M.@Univ Tennessee, Dept Stat Operat & Management Sci, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA::Sawhney, Rapinder S.@Univ Tennessee, Dept Ind & Informat Engineer, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA","Leon, Ramon V.@University of Tennessee Knoxville@University of Tennessee System::Li, Yanzhen@University of Tennessee System@University of Tennessee Knoxville::Guess, Frank M.@University of Tennessee Knoxville@University of Tennessee System::Sawhney, Rapinder S.@University of Tennessee System@University of Tennessee Knoxville",not exist,"EXPLAINING THE GIBBS SAMPLER+CASELLA, G; GEORGE, EI+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 1992::UNDERSTANDING THE METROPOLIS-HASTINGS ALGORITHM+CHIB, S; GREENBERG, E+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+NOV 1995::no title+Congdon, P.+Applied Bayesian modeling+2003::no title+Congdon, P.+Bayesian Statistical Modeling+2001::no title+Crowder, MJ; Kimber, AC; Smith, RL.+Statistical analysis of reliability data+1991::Reliability of space-shuttle pressure vessels with random batch effects+Feiveson, AH; Kulkarni, PM+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 2000::no title+Gamerman, D.+Markov Chain Monte Carlo: Stochastic Simulation for Bayesian Inference+1997::Prediction of Long-Term Failure in Kevlar 49 Composites+Gerstle, F.

High-Dimensional Process Monitoring and Fault Isolation via Variable Selection,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2009,26,54,"Both process monitoring and fault isolation are important and challenging tasks for quality control and improvement in high-dimensional processes. Under a practical assumption that not all variables would shift simultaneously, this paper proposes a variable-selection-based multivariate statistical process control (SPC) procedure for process monitoring and fault diagnosis. A forward-selection algorithm is first utilized to screen out potential out-of-control variables; a multivariate control chart is then set up to monitor suspicious variables. Therefore, detection of faulty conditions and isolation of faulty variables can be achieved in one step.

Checking the Adequacy of Fit of Models from Split-Plot Designs,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2009,25,3,"One of the main features that distinguish split-plot experiments from other experiments is that they involve two types of experimental errors: the whole-plot (WP) error and the subplot (SP) error. Taking this into consideration is very important when computing measures of adequacy of fit for split-plot models. In this article, we propose the computation of two R(2), R(2)-adjusted, prediction error sums of squares (PRESS), and R(2)-prediction statistics to measure the adequacy of fit for the WP and the SP submodels in a split-plot design. This is complemented with the graphical analysis of the two types of errors to check for any violation of the underlying assumptions and the adequacy of fit of split-plot models. Using examples, we show how computing two measures of model adequacy of fit for each split-plot design model is appropriate and useful as they reveal whether the correct WP and SP effects have been included in the model and describe the predictive performance of each group of effects.","Model Adequacy Checking,PRESS,Residual Analysis,R(2),R(2)-Adjusted,R(2)-Prediction,Subplot Error,Whole-Plot Error","COEFFICIENT,PREDICTION","Almini, Ashraf A.@NASA, Langley Res Ctr, Hampton, VA 23681 USA::Kulahci, Murat@Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Informat & Math Modeling, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark::Montgomery, Douglas C.@Arizona State Univ, Dept Ind Syst & Operat Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Almini, Ashraf A.@National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)@NASA Langley Research Center::Kulahci, Murat@Technical University of Denmark::Montgomery, Douglas C.@Arizona State University","kulahci, murat@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4222-9631","RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VARIABLE SELECTION AND DATA AUGMENTATION AND A METHOD FOR PREDICTION+ALLEN, DM+TECHNOMETRICS+1974::MEAN SQUARE ERROR OF PREDICTION AS A CRITERION FOR SELECTING VARIABLES+ALLEN, DM+TECHNOMETRICS+1971::no title+ALMIMI AA+J QUAL TECHNOL+2007::COEFFICIENT OF DETERMINATION - SOME LIMITATIONS+BARRETT, JP+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+1974::The design and analysis of 2(k-p) x 2(q-r) split plot experiments+Bisgaard, S+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2000::Quality quandaries: two-level factorials run as split plot experiments+Bisgaard, S; Fuller, HT; Barrios, E.+Quality Engineering+1996::Split-plot designs for robust product experimentation+Box, G.

A Multivariate Change-Point Model for Change in Mean Vector and/or Covariance Structure,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2009,22,15,"The motivation of the current research manuscript is to provide practitioners with a multivariate-analysis tool able to detect change in the mean vector and/or covariance matrix, as well as the epoch of a change, in an independent sequence of multivariate observations. The article explores the multivariate change-point model through generalized likelihood-ratio statistics applied sequentially and adapted to repeated use. We sought an analytical result for the exact moments of the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) statistic. The benefit flowing from this sequential adaptation is to be able to monitor short runs and unknown parameter processes while controlling their run behavior. Possible areas of application are short run processes, sequential dynamic control, ambulatory monitoring, disease monitoring, and syndromic surveillance.","Change Point,Likelihood Ratio,Short Run,Startup","STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,CONTROL CHARTS,MATRIX,PARAMETERS,VARIANCE","Zamba, K.

Distribution-Free Phase I Control Charts for Subgroup Location,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2009,35,38,"Much of the work in statistical quality control is dependent on the proper completion of a Phase I study. Many Phase I control charts are based on an implicit assumption of normally distributed process observations. In the beginning stages of process control, little information is available about the process and the normality assumption may not be reasonable. Existing robust and distribution-free control charts are concerned with the establishment of Phase II control limits that are robust to nonnormality or outliers from the Phase I sample. Our literature review revealed no purely distribution-free Phase I control-chart methods. We propose a distribution-free method for defining the in-control state of a process and identifying an in-control reference sample. The resultant reference sample can be used to estimate the process parameters for the Phase II procedure of choice. The proposed rank-based method is compared with the traditional 5 chart using Monte Carlo simulation. The rank-based method compares favorably to the 3 chart when the process is normally distributed and performs better than the X chart in many situations when the process distribution is skewed or heavy tailed.","Nonparametric,Shewhart Chart,Statistical Process Control","STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,INDIVIDUAL OBSERVATIONS,CONTROL SCHEMES,R-CHARTS,(X)OVER-BAR,ROBUSTNESS,CUSUM,STANDARD,LIMITS,RANKS","Jones-Farmer, L.

Statistics in Pharmaceutical Development and Manufacturing,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2009,52,11,"The pharmaceutical industry is undergoing rapid change and facing numerous challenges, including the demands of global competition, the need to speed up the drug-development process, and the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) expectations for the incorporation of the principles of quality by design (QbD) and process analytical technology (PAT) in process and analytical development. Statistical thinking and methods play a significant role in addressing these issues. This article provides an overview of the use of statistical thinking and methods in the R&D and manufacturing functions of the pharmaceutical industry. The exposition includes the history of pharmaceutical quality and regulation, phases of pharmaceutical development and manufacturing and the basic quality and statistical tools employed in each, emerging statistical methods, the impact of statistical software and information technology, and the role of statisticians in pharmaceutical development and manufacturing. Four case studies are included to illustrate how these issues play out in actuality. A summary provides a succinct synopsis of those issues and concludes that the complex, technical nature of pharmaceutical development and manufacturing offers many opportunities for the effective use of statistical thinking and methods and that those who use these methods can become catalysts for both process-development understanding and product-quality improvement.

Exact Calculation of Integrated Prediction Variance for Response Surface Designs on Cuboidal and Spherical Regions,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2009,29,1,"Over the years, design optimality evaluation of response surface designs focused mainly on D-optimality and G-optimality criteria. The apparent limited use of the IV-optimality criterion appears to be influenced by the computational challenges associated with the criterion. The lack of available computer code appears to be the main reason for limited use of the IV-optimality criterion. In addition, the IV-optimality criterion appears more difficult to code than the D-optimality criterion because of the integration required over the specified design region. In this paper, an efficient and exact method is presented for computing the IV-optimality criterion for selected response surface designs. The pseudo-code for the computer program is also presented. The investigation examines both spherical and cuboidal regions of interest. In addition, an analytical approach is outlined for computing the IV-optimality criterion for second-order split-plot designs. A particular feature of the analytical expressions is that they are derived using the design parameters. In addition, several comparisons of second-order response surface designs are illustrated for completely randomized designs and split-plot designs.","Design Optimality,IV-Criterion,Region Moments,Restricted Randomization","SECOND-ORDER DESIGNS,SPLIT-PLOT DESIGNS,EQUIVALENT ESTIMATION,CONSTRUCTION,COMPOSITE,CRITERIA,MODELS","Wesley, Wayne R.@Univ Technol, Fac Engn & Comp, Kingston 6, Jamaica::Simpson, James R.@53d Test Management Grp, Eglin AFB, FL USA::Parker, Peter A.@NASA, Langley Res Ctr, Hampton, VA 23681 USA::Pignatiello, Joseph J., Jr.@Florida State Univ, Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, Tallahassee, FL 32310 USA","Wesley, Wayne R.@University of Technology - Jamaica::Simpson, James R.@United States Department of Defense@United States Air Force::Parker, Peter A.@National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)@NASA Langley Research Center::Pignatiello, Joseph J., Jr.@Florida State University@State University System of Florida",not exist,"Using a genetic algorithm to generate small exact response surface designs+Borkowski, J.J.+J.

Product and Process Improvement Using Mixture-Process Variable Methods and Robust Optimization Techniques,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2009,25,6,"A process for producing low-fat mayonnaise was investigated with the goal of optimizing the raw material (RM) recipe and process variable (PV) levels. The investigations included (1) optimizing the recipe for discrete combinations of the PVs, (2) optimizing the recipe to be robust to variations in the PVs, (3) optimizing the PV settings to be robust to variations in the recipe, (4) accounting for a cost constraint, and (5) quantifying the uncertainty in the robust, optimal settings resulting from model estimation and model selection uncertainties. A mixture-process variable (MPV) design was constructed and run as a split-plot experiment. Separate models involving the RM proportions and PV levels were fit and used to develop combined MPV models. Squared-error loss, mean-squared error, and bootstrap methods were applied to develop optimal and robust solutions. Optimal settings of RM proportions and/or PV levels were developed that were less costly and more robust than the reference recipe and PV settings that had been tentatively identified by a nonstatistical approach.","Bootstrap,Factorial Designs,Mixture Experiment Designs,Robust Estimation,Robust Optimization,Split-Plot Experiments","SPLIT-PLOT DESIGNS,RESPONSE-SURFACE OPTIMIZATION,MODEL,NOISE","Sahni, Narinder Singh@Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Sch Informat Technol, Ctr Computat Biol & Bioinformat, New Delhi 110067, India::Piepel, Greg F.@Pacific NW Natl Lab, Stat & Sensor Analyt Grp, Richland, WA 99352 USA::Naes, Tormod@MATFORSK, Norwegian Food Res Inst, N-1400 As, Norway","Sahni, Narinder Singh@Jawaharlal Nehru University::Piepel, Greg F.@Pacific Northwest National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)::Naes, Tormod@Nofima",not exist,"Statistical simulation as an effective tool to evaluate and illustrate the advantage of experimental designs and response surface methods+Brandvik, PJ+CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS+AUG 24 1998::Analyzing experiments with correlated multiple responses+Chiao, CH; Hamada, M+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 2001::no title+Cornell, J.

Statistical Process Monitoring of Nonlinear Profiles Using Wavelets,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2009,29,49,"Many modern industrial processes are capable of generating rich and complex data records that do not readily permit the use of traditional statistical process-control techniques. For example, a ""single observation"" from a process might consist of n pairs of (x, y) data that can be described as y = f(x) when the process is in control. Such data structures or relationships between y and x are called profiles. Examples of profiles include calibration curves in chemical processing, oxide thickness across wafer surfaces in semiconductor manufacturing, and radar signals of military targets. In this paper, a semiparametric wavelet method is proposed for monitoring for changes in sequences of nonlinear profiles. Based on a likelihood ratio test involving a changepoint model, the method uses the spatial-adaptivity properties of wavelets to accurately detect profile changes taking nearly limitless functional forms. The method is used to differentiate between different radar profiles and its performance is assessed with Monte Carlo simulation. The results presented indicate the method can quickly detect a wide variety of changes from a given, in-control profile.","Average Run Length,Change Point,Control Charts Likelihood Ratio,Nonlinear,Semiparametric,Statistical Process Control,Wavelet Thresholding","QUALITY PROFILES,LINEAR PROFILES,SHRINKAGE,PRODUCT","Chicken, Eric@Florida State Univ, Dept Stat, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA::Pignatiello, Joseph, Jr.@Florida State Univ, Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA::Simpson, James R.@Unknow","Chicken, Eric@Florida State University@State University System of Florida::Pignatiello, Joseph, Jr.@Florida State University@State University System of Florida::Simpson, James R.@Unknow",not exist,"Adaptive wavelet estimation: A block thresholding and oracle inequality approach+Cai, TT+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 1999::Block thresholding for density estimation: local and global adaptivity+Chicken, E; Cai, TT+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+JUL 2005::Block-dependent thresholding in wavelet regression+Chicken, E+JOURNAL OF NONPARAMETRIC STATISTICS+JUN 2005::Block thresholding and wavelet estimation for nonequispaced samples+Chicken, E+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+SEP 1 2003::no title+CHICKEN E+M976 FLOR STAT U DEP+2006::Statistical process control for geometric specifications: On the monitoring of roundness profiles+Colosimo, Bianca M.; Semeraro, Quirico; Pacella, Massimo+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2008::no title+Daubechies, I.+Ten Lectures on wavelets+1992::Phase I analysis for monitoring nonlinear profiles in manufacturing processes+Ding, Yu; Zeng, Li; Zhou, Shiyu+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 2006::IDEAL SPATIAL ADAPTATION BY WAVELET SHRINKAGE+DONOHO, DL; JOHNSTONE, IM+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1994::Adapting to unknown smoothness via wavelet shrinkage+Donoho, DL; Johnstone, IM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1995::no title+FAN JQ+J AM STAT ASSOC+1996::no title+FELLER W+INTRO PROBABILITY TH+1968::no title+GARDNER M+IEEE T COMPONENTS C+1997::Wavelet-based SPC procedure for complicated functional data+Jeong, MK; Lu, JC; Wang, N+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH+FEB 15 2006::no title+JIN J+J INTELL MANUF+2001::Feature-preserving data compression of stamping tonnage information using wavelets+Jin, JH; Shi, JJ+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1999::no title+Johnson, L.W.; Riess, R.D.+Numerical Analysis+1982::On-line monitoring when the process yields a linear profile+Kang, L; Albin, SL+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 2000::On the monitoring of linear profiles+Kim, K; Mahmoud, MA; Woodall, WH+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 2003::A change point method for linear profile data+Mahmoud, Mahmoud A.; Parker, Peter A.; Woodall, William H.; et al.+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+MAR 2007::no title+Mallat, S.+A Wavelet Tour of Signal Processing+1999::MULTIRESOLUTION APPROXIMATIONS AND WAVELET ORTHONORMAL BASES OF L2(R)+MALLAT, SG+TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY+SEP 1989::no title+Montgomery, D.

Process Partitions from Time-Ordered Clusters,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2009,33,8,"Statistical analysis of massive multivariate industrial data sets might not be effective unless the data is first partitioned into stable operating regions. Standard statistical methods that are based on global models, like principal component and regression analyses, can be ineffective if the process is not under statistical control. Here, constrained clustering is proposed as a practical, robust, general solution to detect change points and partition historical process data. The constraint is that only observations (or clusters) that are contiguous in time can be joined. This paper describes a method for partitioning data sets into stable regions by modifying agglomerative clustering algorithms to take into account the time order within the data set. A stopping criterion is proposed to evaluate the number of change points generated, and several empirical studies with simulated and actual data are presented, The result is a partitioned data set that is better suited for analysis by standard statistical methods.","Change Point,Cluster Analysis,Data Mining,Data Segmentation,Partitioning","CHANGE-POINT ESTIMATORS,2 SEPARATE REGIMES,LINEAR-REGRESSION,RANDOM-VARIABLES,SEGMENTATION,TESTS,ALGORITHMS,INFERENCE,MODELS","Harnish, Peter@Weyerhaeuser Co, Longview, WA USA::Nelson, Ben@Weyerhaeuser Co, Longview, WA USA::Runger, George@Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ USA","Harnish, Peter@Unknow::Nelson, Ben@Unknow::Runger, George@Arizona State University",not exist,"Multivariate process control+Alt, FB; Smith, ND.+HDB STATISTICS+1988::Optimal changepoint tests for normal linear regression+Andrews, DWK; Lee, I; Ploberger, W+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JAN 1996::Estimation of a change point in multiple regression models+Bai, J+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+NOV 1997::Estimating and testing linear models with multiple structural changes+Bai, JS; Perron, P+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 1998::PREANALYSIS OF SUPERLARGE INDUSTRIAL DATA SETS+BANKS, DL; PARMIGIANI, G+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1992::MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION OF A CHANGE-POINT IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF INDEPENDENT RANDOM-VARIABLES - GENERAL MULTIPARAMETER CASE+BHATTACHARYA, PK+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+DEC 1987::A region-based segmentation method for multichannel image data+Bose, S; OSullivan, F+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1997::NONPARAMETRIC CHANGE-POINT ESTIMATION+CARLSTEIN, E+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+MAR 1988::Ball-like structures of the Beltrami flow field+Chu, ZKH+ZAMM-ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ANGEWANDTE MATHEMATIK UND MECHANIK+FEB 2005::THE ASYMPTOTIC-BEHAVIOR OF SOME NONPARAMETRIC CHANGE-POINT ESTIMATORS+DUMBGEN, L+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+SEP 1991::ON GROUPING FOR MAXIMUM HOMOGENEITY+FISHER, WD+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1958::TIME-ORDERED CLASSIFICATION+HINKLEY, DV+BIOMETRIKA+1972::INFERENCE ABOUT CHANGE-POINT FROM CUMULATIVE SUM TESTS+HINKLEY, DV+BIOMETRIKA+1971::INFERENCE ABOUT CHANGE-POINT IN A SEQUENCE OF RANDOM VARIABLES+HINKLEY, DV+BIOMETRIKA+1970::no title+HINKLEY DV+BIOMETRIKA+1970::USE OF CUMULATIVE SUMS OF SQUARES FOR RETROSPECTIVE DETECTION OF CHANGES OF VARIANCE+INCLAN, C; TIAO, GC+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1994::no title+Kaufman, L; Rousseeuw, P J.+Finding Groups in Data: An Introduction to Cluster Analysis+1990::Optimal segmentation of random processes+Lavielle, M+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING+MAY 1998::DETECTION OF CHANGES IN THE SPECTRUM OF A MULTIDIMENSIONAL PROCESS+LAVIELLE, M+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING+FEB 1993::Nonparametric multiple change-point estimators+Lee, CB+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+MAY 1 1996::On segmented multivariate regression+Liu, J; Wu, SY; Zidek, JV+STATISTICA SINICA+APR 1997::Change point estimation using nonparametric regression+Loader, CR+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+AUG 1996::Polynomial approximation schemes and exact algorithms for optimum curve segmentation problems+Minoux, M+DISCRETE APPLIED MATHEMATICS+NOV 30 2004::no title+Morrison, D.

Profile Monitoring via Nonlinear Mixed Models,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2009,40,72,"Profile monitoring is a relatively new technique in quality control best used where the process data follow a profile (or curve) at each time period. Little work has been done on the monitoring of nonlinear profiles. Previous work has assumed that the measurements within a profile are uncorrelated. To relax this restriction, we propose the use of nonlinear mixed models to monitor the nonlinear profiles in order to account for the correlation structure. We evaluate the effectiveness of fitting separate nonlinear regression models to each profile in Phase I control chart applications for data with uncorrelated errors and no random effects. For data with random effects, we compare the effectiveness of charts based on a separate nonlinear regression approach versus those based on a nonlinear mixed model approach. Our proposed approach uses the separate nonlinear regression model fits to obtain a nonlinear mixed model fit. Our studies show the nonlinear mixed model approach to be clearly superior to fitting separate nonlinear regression models. As a consequence, the nonlinear mixed model approach results in charts with good abilities to detect changes in Phase I data and has a simple-to-calculate control limit.","Eblups,Multivariate Statistical Process Control,Nonlinear Model,Phase I,T-2 Statistic","MULTIVARIATE CONTROL CHARTS,PHASE-I ANALYSIS,LINEAR PROFILES,QUALITY PROFILES,PRODUCT","Jensen, Willis A.@WL Gore & Assoc Inc, Med Prod Div, Flagstaff, AZ 86003 USA::Birch, Jeffrey B.@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Jensen, Willis A.@Unknow::Birch, Jeffrey B.@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University",not exist,"Statistical process control for geometric specifications: On the monitoring of roundness profiles+Colosimo, Bianca M.; Semeraro, Quirico; Pacella, Massimo+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2008::Nonlinear models for repeated measurement data: An overview and update+Davidian, M; Giltinan, DM+JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS+DEC 2003::no title+Davidian, M.; Giltinan, D.

Uniform Designs for Highly Constrained Mixture Experiments,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2009,33,16,"The goal of a space-filling design is to uniformly scatter the design points in the experimental region of interest. For mixture experiment designs of reasonable size, as the dimensionality of the experimental region increases, space-filling design criteria (such as maximin and minimax) place most, if not all, design points at or near the boundary of the constrained region. This article introduces two number-theoretic methods for generating space-filling (specifically uniform) designs for constrained mixture experiments defined by single- and multiple-component constraints, The two methods are illustrated for a simple 3-component mixture problem and a more complicated 16-component waste-glass mixture problem. The uniform scatter of the points in the resulting designs is evaluated using three distance-based criteria.","Lattice-Point Sets,Mixture Experiment Designs,Multiple-Component Constraints,Number-Theoretic Nets,Single-Component Constraints,Space-Filling Designs","LATIN-HYPERCUBE DESIGNS,COMPUTER EXPERIMENTS,DISTANCE DESIGNS,MINIMAX,MODELS,OUTPUT","Borkowski, John J.@Montana State Univ, Dept Math Sci, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA::Piepel, Greg F.@Stat & Sensor Analyt, Stat & Sensor Analyt Grp, Battelle Pacific NW Div, Richland, WA 99352 USA","Borkowski, John J.@Montana State University System@Montana State University@Montana State University Bozeman::Piepel, Greg F.@Pacific Northwest National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)",not exist,"Optimal designs for experiments with mixtures: A survey+Chan, LY+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2000::no title+COOLEY S+P AM STAT ASS SECT P+2003::no title+CORNELL JA+EXPT MIXTURES+2002::no title+DUCKWORTH HWM+J STAT PLAN INFER+2000::no title+Fang, K.

Detecting Relative Changes in Multiple Comparisons with an Overall Mean,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2009,18,9,"Analysis of means (ANOM) is a procedure used for comparisons with the overall mean by taking the correlations between the comparisons into account. This procedure can be used, for example, in statistical process control to improve product quality. Our interest is to devise inference procedures when the aim is to detect percentage changes from the overall mean in a normal one-way layout. Like ANOM, the results can be presented graphically. Moreover, adjusted p-values and Simultaneous confidence intervals for ratios to the overall mean can be constructed. Because ratio parameters are dimensionless, we demonstrate advantages of the proposed approach using examples for comparing several mutants using equal and unequal relative thresholds and for obtaining a set of comparable simultaneous confidence intervals in multiple endpoints.","Analysis of Means,ANOM,Feller's Theorem,Simultaneous Inference","SIMULTANEOUS CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS,COMPUTATION","Djira, Gemechis D.@S Dakota State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Brookings, SD 57007 USA::Hothron, Ludwig A.@Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Biostat, Hannover, Germany","Djira, Gemechis D.@South Dakota State University::Hothron, Ludwig A.@University of Hannover",not exist,"Simultaneous confidence sets and confidence intervals for multiple ratios+Dilba, G; Bretz, F; Guiard, V+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+AUG 1 2006::SOME PROBLEMS IN INTERVAL ESTIMATION+FIELLER, EC+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1954::Pairwise multiple comparison procedures with unequal ns and or variances: A Monte Carlo study+Games, P.A.; Howell, J.F.+J.

A typical case where this happens is whenever registering the exact value of the characteristic of interest is expensive or difficult (e.g., when the observations come in the form of grouped data, due to the use of m-step gauges). The exact distribution of the waiting time is derived by using a Markov chain-embedding technique, which is then used in order to determine the most appropriate design for the quality-control problems discussed.","Grouped Data,Markov Chain Embeddable Random Variables,Multivariate Statistical Quality Control,Quality Control,Waiting-Time Distributions","MARKOV-CHAIN APPROACH,UP DEMONSTRATION TEST,CONTROL CHARTS,GROUPED DATA,RELIABILITY,SYSTEMS,TESTS","Balakrishnan, N.@McMaster Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada::Bersimis, S.@Univ Piraeus, Dept Stat & Insurance Sci, Piraeus 18534, Greece::Koutras, M.

Reducing Start Time Delays in Operating Rooms,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2009,20,18,"Problem: Health care today is facing serious problems: quality of care does not meet patients' needs and costs are exploding. Inefficient utilization of expensive operating rooms is one of the major problems in many hospitals worldwide. A benchmark study of 13 hospitals in the Netherlands and Belgium showed that, for a variety of reasons, surgery consistently started too late.

Approach: For a short and a somewhat longer period, two selected hospitals from the benchmark study agreed to record the start times of the first operation each day for each of their operating rooms. In addition to start times, the improvement team also recorded potential influence factors (covariates, or X's). Statistical techniques used during the project were statistical graphics, Pareto charts, histograms, box plots, time-series plots, Box-Cox transformations, and ANOVA to determine possible influential factors.

Results: It is shown that anesthesia technique and specialty are influence factors. However, the poor planning and scheduling process turned out to be the most important factor in the delay of start times. After introducing a new planning process, the hospitals involved were able to gain substantial cost savings, increased efficiency, and substantial reductions of the delay in start times for surgery.","ANOVA,Box-Cox transformation,Health Care Quality,Lean Six Sigma,Pareto Charts",TRANSFORMATIONS,"Does, Ronald J.

Experimental design considerations for accelerated life tests with nonlinear constraints and censoring,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2008,21,5,"Problem: As the electronic industry has adopted lead-free solder joint technology, the failure acceleration model for solder joint fatigue needs to be reinvestigated through accelerated life tests (ALT). However, traditional ALT designs currently employed by the industry fail to provide sufficient information for this purpose.

Approach: This paper explores criteria for effectively planning ALT. It addresses the problem by hypothesizing a model form, deriving the model parameters using real data, and simulating ALT results for different experimental design plans. Relative comparisons are drawn between the influence of experimental design selection and some traditional reliability test plan variables such as sample size, censoring scheme, and sample allocation.

Results: We find that the importance of selecting an experimental design exceeds the importance usually given to the selection of sample size and censoring scheme, or to the choice of a test unit allocation strategy in the context of a reliability test case study. D-optimal-based designs provide good performance for acceleration model validation, especially when the testing feasibility region is asymmetric. D-optimal designs offer an eightfold reduction in sample size over legacy designs for a fixed precision. Alternatively, D-optimal designs yield a 3.5x increase in parameter estimate precision over legacy designs for a fixed sample size. Numerical simulations confirm that legacy designs provide insufficient precision to determine if two or three model parameters are significant.","D-optimality,experimental design,reliability,solder joint reliability,temperature cycle","MULTIPLE LEVELS,STRESS","Monroe, Eric M.@Intel Corp, Chandler, AZ 85226 USA::Pan, Rong@Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ USA","Monroe, Eric M.@Intel Corporation::Pan, Rong@Arizona State University",not exist,"Temperature cycling+[Anonymous].+JEDEC Standard JESD22-A104C+2005::no title+Blish, Richard.+SEMATECH, Use Condition Based Reliability Evaluation of New Semiconductor Technologies, Technology Transfer # 99083810A-XFR+August 31,  1999::no title+CLECH JP+LEAD FREE SOLDER INT+2005::A study of the effects of cyclic thermal stresses on a ductile metal+Coffin, JLF.+Trans ASME+1954::no title+DARVEAUX R+P TMS ANN M+1997::no title+ENGELMAIER W+ISHM TECHNICAL MONOG+1984::PLANNING ACCELERATED LIFE TESTS WITH 2 OR MORE EXPERIMENTAL FACTORS+ESCOBAR, LA; MEEKER, WQ+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1995::D-optimal reliability test design for two-stress accelerated life tests+Guo, H.; Pan, R.+P IEEE INT C IND ENG+2007::no title+*JEDEC+JESD22A105C JEDEC SO+2004::no title+MANSON SS+NACATN2933 NASA LEW+1953::no title+MENCINGER NP+ASSEMBLY TECHNOLOGY+2000::Optimal sample size allocation for tests with multiple levels of stress with extreme value regression+Ng, H.

In this paper, we propose and illustrate the use of p-values, estimated by simulation, for Lenth t-statistics. This approach is recommended for its versatility. Whereas tabulated critical values are restricted to the case of uncorrelated estimates, we illustrate the use of p-values for both orthogonal and nonorthogonal designs. For cases where there is limited replication, we suggest computing t-statistics and the corresponding p-values using an estimator that combines the pure error mean square with a modified Lenth's pseudo-standard error.","center-point replication,effect sparsity,missing data,pure error,saturated model",UNREPLICATED FACTORIAL-DESIGNS,"Edwards, David J.@Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Stat Sci & Operat Res, Richmond, VA 23284 USA::Mee, Robert W.@Univ Tennessee, Dept Stat Operat & Management Sci, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA","Edwards, David J.@Virginia Commonwealth University::Mee, Robert W.@University of Tennessee Knoxville@University of Tennessee System",not exist,"COMBINING UNBIASED ESTIMATORS+GRAYBILL, FA; DEAL, RB+BIOMETRICS+1959::INFERENCE FOR EFFECT-SATURATED FRACTIONAL FACTORIALS+HAALAND, PD; OCONNELL, MA+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1995::Analyzing unreplicated factorial experiments: A review with some new proposals+Hamada, M; Balakrishnan, N+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 1998::no title+Hicks, C.

Combinations of multivariate shewhart and MEWMA control charts for monitoring the mean vector and covariance matrix,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2008,18,21,"When monitoring a process that has multivariate normal variables, the Shewhart-type control chart traditionally used for monitoring the process mean vector is effective for detecting large shifts, but for detecting small shifts, it is more effective to use the multivariate exponentially weighted moving average (MEWMA) control chart. It has been proposed that better overall performance in detecting small and large shifts in the mean can be obtained by using the MEWMA chart in combination with the Shewhart chart. Here we investigate the performance of this combination in the context of the more general problem of detecting changes in the mean or increases in variability. Recent investigations of combinations of the MEWMA chart for the mean and MEWMA-type charts based on the squared deviations of the observations from the target has shown that these combinations have excellent performance in detecting sustained shifts in the mean or in variability. Here we consider both sustained and transient shifts and show that a combination of two MEWMA charts has better overall performance than the combination of the MEWMA and Shewhart charts. We also consider a three-chart combination consisting of the MEWMA chart for the mean, an MEWMA-type chart of the squared deviations from target, and the Shewhart chart. When the sample size is n = 1, this three-chart combination does not seem to have better overall performance than the combination of the two MEWMA charts. When n > 1, the three-chart combination has significantly better performance for some mean shifts, but somewhat worse performance for shifts in variability.","average time to signal,multivariate exponentially weighted moving average control chart,regression adjustment of variables,Shewhart chart,squared deviations from target,statistical process control,steady-state average time to signal,surveillance,transient shift","WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE,QUALITY-CONTROL,VARIABLES","Reynolds, Marion R., Jr.@Virginia Tech, Dept Stat & Forestry, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Stoumbos, Zachaby G.@Rutgers State Univ, Dept Management Sci & Informat Syst, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA","Reynolds, Marion R., Jr.@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Stoumbos, Zachaby G.@Rutgers State University New Brunswick",not exist,"no title+Hawkins, D.

Exact inference for response surface designs within a split-plot structure,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2008,17,14,"Many industrial experiments involve factors that are hard to change as well as factors that are easy to change, which leads naturally to split-plot experiments. Unfortunately, the literature for second-order response surface designs traditionally assumes a completely randomized design. By carefully choosing the design for response surface experiments, it is possible to guarantee that the ordinary least-squares estimates of the model are equivalent to the generalized least-squares estimates. This paper uses designs satifying this result to derive conditions for exact tests of almost all of the model parameters. It then sets up the Satterthwaite's procedure for the remaining parameters. An example illustrates the methodology. Comparisons between the exact estimators, estimators based on replicated points, and estimators using restricted maximum likelihood estimators (REML) are done using the example.","central composite designs,design of experiments,response surface methodology,split-plot experiments",EQUIVALENT ESTIMATION,"Vining, G.

Directional MEWMA schemes for multistage process monitoring and diagnosis,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2008,40,43,"Statistical process control, monitoring, and diagnosis of a multistage process remain challenging problems in both the manufacturing and service industries. This paper proposes a directional multivariate exponentially weighted moving average (directional MEWMA) scheme integrating the EWMA scheme with the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) scheme that can incorporate directional information based on the multistage state-space model and effectively monitor the process mean shift. The proposed directional MEWMA scheme not only provides a statistical process control (SPC) solution that incorporates both interstage and intrastage correlations but also resolves the confounding issue in monitoring and diagnosis due to the cumulative effects from stage to stage. In addition, a systematic diagnostic approach is provided to isolate and identify an out-of-control stage and to locate its change point. Our simulation results show that the proposed monitoring and diagnostic scheme consistently outperforms almost all existing approaches to multistage processes.

Robustness comparison of exponentially weighted moving-average charts on autocorrelated data and on residuals,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2008,38,7,"Control charting of autocorrelated data has been the subject of extensive research over the past two decades. A standard approach is to apply an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) chart to either the autocorrelated data or to the residuals of an autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) model of the process. Numerous empirical studies have demonstrated that many control charts for autocorrelated data, residual-based charts in particular, lack robustness to ARMA modeling errors. In this article, we quantify and corroborate these empirical findings by developing analytical expressions for the sensitivity of EWMA control charts applied to residuals and to autocorrelated data. The analytical results provide insight into the mechanisms behind the (lack of) robustness and also provide a basis for comparing the robustness of the two approaches. One conclusion is that, although the residual-based EWMA may lack robustness, it is generally more robust than the EWMA applied to the autocorrelated data.","autoregressive moving-average model,control chart,model error,robustness,statistical process control","STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,TIME-SERIES,MONITORING SCHEMES,MODEL UNCERTAINTY,RUN-LENGTH,DESIGN,PERFORMANCE","Apley, Daniel W.@Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA::Lee, Hyun Cheol@Samsung Elect, Qual Assurance Dept, Samsung Elect Semicond Business, Hwasung City 445701, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea","Apley, Daniel W.@Northwestern University::Lee, Hyun Cheol@Samsung","Apley, Daniel@B-7454-2009","Robustness of forecast-based monitoring schemes+Adams, BM; Tseng, IT+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 1998::EFFECTS OF AUTOCORRELATION ON CONTROL CHART PERFORMANCE+ALWAN, LC+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1992::TIME-SERIES MODELING FOR STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL+ALWAN, LC; ROBERTS, HV+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JAN 1988::An optimal filter design approach to statistical process control+Apley, Daniel W.; Chin, Chang-Ho+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 2007::no title+APLEY DW+EFFECTS MODEL UNPUB+2008::The GLRT for statistical process control of autocorrelated processes+Apley, DW; Shi, J+IIE TRANSACTIONS+SEP 1999::Time series control charts in the presence of model uncertainty+Apley, DW+JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME+NOV 2002::Design of exponentially weighted moving average control charts for autocorrelated processes with model uncertainty+Apley, DW; Lee, HC+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 2003::no title+Astrom, K.

Optimal foldovers and semifolding for minimum aberration even fractional factorial designs,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2008,13,5,"Sequential experimentation is one key to the successful use of fractional factorial designs. When one fractional factorial experiment with many factors produces results that, while useful, are not quite conclusive, adding another fraction is often recommended. This article addresses adding another fraction to a resolution IV design containing near the maximal number of factors. We extend the existing literature on foldover designs by presenting general results for identifying the best foldover for resolution IV designs for k factors in n = 2k runs and minimum aberration projections of these designs. We also consider semifolding because follow-up designs with n/2 runs exist that permit estimation of just as many effects of interest as are provided by a regular foldover. The ideas are illustrated for a 15-factor ceramic fiber composite experiment.","alias-length pattern,design augmentation,minimal design,resolution IV",2-LEVEL,"Mee, Robert V.@Univ Tennessee, Dept Stat Operat & Management Sci, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA::Xiao, Jihua (Regina)@Micron Technol Inc, Change Management Grp Micron, Boise, ID 83707 USA","Mee, Robert V.@University of Tennessee Knoxville@University of Tennessee System::Xiao, Jihua (Regina)@Micron Technology",not exist,"no title+BLOCK RM+THESIS U TENNESSEE K+2003::Some theory for constructing minimum aberration fractional factorial designs+Butler, NA+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 2003::A CATALOG OF 2-LEVEL AND 3-LEVEL FRACTIONAL FACTORIAL-DESIGNS WITH SMALL RUNS+CHEN, JH; SUN, DX; WU, CFJ+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+APR 1993::Use of half-normal plots in interpreting factorial two level experiments+Daniel, C.+Technometrics+1959::3 QUARTER REPLICATES OF 2N DESIGNS+JOHN, PWM+BIOMETRICS+1962::Breaking alias chains in fractional factorials+John, PWM+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2000::INVESTIGATION AND IMPROVEMENT OF A PROCESS FOR VACUUM-FORMED CERAMIC FIBER COMPOSITES, USING A FRACTIONAL 2(N) EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGN+JONES, KF; MARRS, I; YOUNG, J; et al.+JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS+1995::QUICK AND EASY ANALYSIS OF UNREPLICATED FACTORIALS+LENTH, RV+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1989::Optimal foldover plans for two-level fractional factorial designs+Li, W; Lin, DKJ+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 2003::Semifolding 2(k-p) designs+Mee, RW; Peralta, M+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 2000::Foldovers of 2(k-p) resolution IV experimental designs+Montgomery, DC; Runger, GC+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 1996::no title+SUN DX+COMMUNICATION+2001::Critical values of the lenth method for unreplicated factorial designs+Ye, KQ; Hamada, M+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2000"
Performance comparisons for the synthetic control chart for detecting increases in fraction nonconforming,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2008,20,20,"The performance of the recently proposed synthetic control chart for detecting increases in fraction nonconforming is re-evaluated and comparisons with a wider range of alternative charts are presented. It is shown that the previously reported strong performance of the synthetic chart was due to the implicit inclusion of a 'head-start' feature when computing the reported values of average time to signal (ATS). The comparisons considered here, using both initial-state and steady-state evaluations of ATS, show that, without the head-start feature, the performance of the synthetic chart is not much better than that of the np chart and also that there are better alternatives, in particular, the use of a CUSUM of the run lengths of conforming items (termed the run-length CUSUM). Consideration may also be given to the use of the RL2 chart, which is based on the moving sum of two successive conforming run lengths. While the superior performance of the run-length CUSUM is clearly demonstrated, the RL2 chart also performs quite well, except for specified circumstances, when it should not be used.","attributes-data control chart,conforming run-length,geometric CUSUM,statistical process control","LENGTH CONTROL CHARTS,100-PERCENT INSPECTION,CONTROL SCHEMES,SHIFTS,CUSUM","Bourke, Patrick D.@Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Cork, Ireland","Bourke, Patrick D.@University College Cork",not exist,"The RL2 chart versus the np chart for detecting upward shifts in fraction defective+Bourke, PD+JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS+JAN 2006::The geometric CUSUM chart with sampling inspection for monitoring fraction defective+Bourke, PD+JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS+NOV 2001::DETECTING A SHIFT IN FRACTION NONCONFORMING USING RUN-LENGTH CONTROL CHARTS WITH 100-PERCENT INSPECTION+BOURKE, PD+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1991::Sample size and the Binomial CUSUM Control Chart: the case of 100% inspection+Bourke, PD+METRIKA+2001::QUALITY-CONTROL TECHNIQUES FOR ZERO DEFECTS+CALVIN, TW+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPONENTS HYBRIDS AND MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY+1983::A NEW 2-SIDED CUMULATIVE SUM QUALITY-CONTROL SCHEME+CROSIER, RB+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 1986::Evaluating and improving the synthetic control chart+Davis, RB; Woodall, WH+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 2002::no title+Duncan, A.

Upper tolerance intervals adjusted for multiple nuisance uncertainties,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2008,20,0,"In many product-quality situations, it is of interest to state with X% confidence that at least Y% of the product made during a given period has true (unknown) values of a property below a calculated value. Such a statistical statement can be made using an upper Y%-content tolerance interval with X% confidence, which is also referred to as an X%/Y% upper tolerance interval (X%/Y% UTI). In this article, we present the methodology and formulas for calculating X%/Y% UTIs on the true property values when there are sources of uncertainty from nuisance factors (nuisance uncertainties) in addition to the source of variation of interest. The nuisance uncertainties may include regression model uncertainty if a regression model is used to predict the product property of interest. The X%/Y% UTI methodology is developed and illustrated using an example in which there are sampling, analytical, and regression model nuisance uncertainties in addition to the source of variation for which a statistical tolerance statement is desired. The design and results of a simulation study conducted to assess the performance of the X%/Y% UTI method are described. The X%/Y% UTI method that adjusts for nuisance uncertainties is shown to generally achieve the nominal X% and Y% values and yields significantly smaller UTIs than not adjusting for the nuisance uncertainties.","analytical uncertainty,model uncertainty,Monte Carlo simulation,noncentral t-distribution,sampling uncertainty,Satterthwaite's method","MEASUREMENT ERROR,LIMITS","Piepel, Greg F.@Battelle Pacific NW Div, Richland, WA 99352 USA::Cooley, Scott K.@Battelle Pacific NW Div, Richland, WA 99352 USA::Paul, Matthew R.@Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA 50011 USA","Piepel, Greg F.@Pacific Northwest National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)::Cooley, Scott K.@Pacific Northwest National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)::Paul, Matthew R.@Iowa State University",not exist,"1998 Annual Book of ASTM Standards+no author+ASTM D5-97 Standard test method for penetration of bituminous materials+1998::THE ROBUSTNESS OF 2-SIDED TOLERANCE LIMITS FOR NORMAL-DISTRIBUTIONS+CANAVOS, GC; KOUTROUVELIS, IA+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+1984::no title+Conover, W.

Two cases are considered: (1) 0-1 or pass/fail data, and (2) continuous measurement data. While NDE data are less expensive to collect, they are less precise than DT data. However, taking more NDE data provides more precision. The proposed framework provides a way to calculate equivalent sample sizes of NDE data for given sample sizes of DT data.

The proposed chart is useful in detecting any malfunctioning gauges that cause a shift of bias, linearity, or precision. An in-control condition of the charting scheme provides evidence that the gauges are functioning properly and thus consistent and accurate measurements from the gauges are ensured. The run-length performance of the proposed charting scheme is compared with that of a Shewhart charting scheme for monitoring linearity between two measurement gauges.

Analysis of optimization experiments,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2008,29,4,"The typical practice for analyzing industrial experiments is to identify statistically significant effects with a 5% level of significance and then to optimize the model containing only those effects. In this article, we illustrate the danger in utilizing this approach. We propose methodology using the practical significance level, which is a quantity that a practitioner can easily specify. We also propose utilizing empirical Bayes estimation, which gives shrinkage estimates of the effects. Interestingly, the mechanics of statistical testing can be viewed as an approximation to empirical Bayes estimation, but with a significance level in the range of 15-40%. We also establish the connections that our approach has with a less known but intriguing technique proposed by Taguchi, known as the beta coefficient method.

Assessing a binary measurement system,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2008,14,14,"Assessing measurement systems is a necessary task in all industrial contexts. While a great deal has been written about assessing measurement systems that yield continuous outputs, little work addresses binary measurement systems despite their widespread use. This article proposes two new plans for assessing a binary measurement system that are applicable when we can assume the pass rate of the system is known. This assumption is often reasonable when we need to assess a system used for 100% inspection in a production process. The plans provide estimates of the misclassification rates as well as the proportion of conforming items produced. The two methods are compared to existing plans.","gauge R&R,go/no-go testing,inspection errors,misclassification rates,pass-fail inspection",RELATIVE RISK,"Danila, Oana@Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Business & Ind Stat Res Grp, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada::Steiner, Stefan H.@Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Business & Ind Stat Res Grp, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada::Mackay, R.

A new EWMA chart for monitoring process dispersion,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2008,21,33,"Using a normalizing transformation to monitor process dispersion has received a great deal of attention. The exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control chart based on the logarithmic transformation of sample variance for monitoring increases in process variability is one such dispersion chart. The traditional EWMA-type dispersion chart resets the EWMA statistic to zero whenever it falls below zero. This paper proposes a new EWMA dispersion chart (NEWMA) by truncating negative normalized observations to zero in the traditional EWMA statistic. The comparison result shows that the NEWMA chart outperforms the traditional EWMA chart for detecting dispersion changes, especially at small changes.","average run length,gamma distribution,Markov chain,statistical process control,variance","WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGES,CONTROL SCHEMES,VARIANCE,VARIABILITY,CUSUM","Shu, Lianjie@Univ Macau, Fac Business Adm, Macao, Peoples R China::Jiang, Wei@Stevens Inst Technol, Sch Syst & Enterprises, Dept Syst Engn & Engn Management, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA","Shu, Lianjie@University of Macau::Jiang, Wei@Stevens Institute of Technology","Shu, Lianjie@B-7911-2016","A comparison of control charting procedures for monitoring process dispersion+Acosta-Mejia, CA; Pignatiello, JJ; Rao, BV+IIE TRANSACTIONS+JUN 1999::Monitoring reduction in variability with the range+Acosta-Mejia, CA+IIE TRANSACTIONS+JUN 1998::Mean and variance of truncated normal distributions+Barr, DR; Sherrill, ET+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+NOV 1999::no title+Box, G.

Estimation of sigma for individuals charts,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2008,31,11,"We study the problem of estimating sigma from individuals' data in the presence of out-of-control and nonnormal conditions. We consider a large number of estimators for a that have been proposed in the last 20 years. Using simulation, we compute the mean squared errors for 10 of these estimators, both before and after screening for outliers with median-absolute-deviation-based control limits. We also consider the effect of contaminated data on the performance of EWMA (exponentially weighted moving average) charts. We show, by simulation, that Boyles' dynamic linear model estimator is, after screening, often the best way of estimating or. We also show that an approach that involves robustly testing for shifts prior to final estimation of sigma can be approximated by an automatic method based on smoothing the data first and estimating sigma from residuals; this method is often nearly as effective as that of Boyles and is sometimes better. We also find that there are some situations where noisy data are not amenable to accurate estimation of a, even at a moderately large sample size. In such cases, engineering considerations and careful data analysis are required to obtain more accurate estimates.","dynamic linear models,loess,moving ranges,smoothing","RUN-LENGTH DISTRIBUTIONS,MOVING AVERAGE CHARTS,ESTIMATED PARAMETERS,DESIGN,(X)OVER-BAR,SCHEMES","Braun, W.

Modeling and analysis strategies for failure amplification method,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2008,10,4,The failure amplification method (FAMe) uses a special type of factor known as amplification factor to amplify the failure probability so as to maximize the information in the experiment. A general strategy for model building in FAMe is proposed by using generalized linear models (GLM). The best design settings for improving the process capability are determined through carefully selected GLMs and loss functions. Two real experiments for improving the quality of printed circuit boards are used to illustrate the proposed strategy.,"design of experiments,generalized linear models,model selection,process capability,robust parameter design",,"Jeng, Shuen-Lin@Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Stat, Tainan 701, Taiwan::Joseph, V.

In automotive-body manufacturing, measurement systems take data for many quality characteristics, yet manufacturers evaluate each response independently. To support using these data as a multivariate response, this paper develops multivariate extensions of gauge-approval criteria precision to tolerance ratio, percent R&R, and signal-to-noise ratio. These criteria use the volume of constant-density contours to characterize variability, the role of the standard deviation in single-variable models. This paper contains a MANOVA method using expected mean squares for estimating the variance-covariance matrices for one-factor, two-factor, and three-factor gauge studies. The paper demonstrates how to fit the MANOVA model and estimate the multivariate criteria using automotive body panel gauge-study data.","gauge study,MANOVA,measurement-systems analysis,multivariate capability,signal-to-noise ratio","R-AND-R,PRODUCTION QUALITY,PROCESS CAPABILITY,GAUGE,CALIBRATION,METROLOGY,VARIANCE,DESIGN,MODELS,MANOVA","Majeske, Karl D.@Oakland Univ, Sch Business Adm, Rochester, MI 48309 USA","Majeske, Karl D.@Oakland University",not exist,"Confidence intervals for a discrimination ratio in a gauge R&amp;R study with three random factors+Adamec, E.; Burdick, R.K.+Quality Engineering+2003::no title+*AIAG+MEAS SYST AN+2002::no title+AMENIYA Y+AM STAT+1985::MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATORS AND LIKELIHOOD RATIO CRITERIA IN MULTIVARIATE COMPONENTS OF VARIANCE+ANDERSON, BM; ANDERSON, TW; OLKIN, I+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 1986::no title+Barrentine, L.+Concepts for R&amp;R studies+1991::A general multivariate Bayesian process capability index+Bernardo, JM; Irony, TZ+STATISTICIAN+1996::no title+Breyfogle, F.+Implementing Six Sigma: Smarter Solutions Using Statistical Methods+2003::A review of methods for measurement systems capability analysis+Burdick, RK; Borror, CM; Montgomery, DC+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 2003::Index C* pm in multiple response optimization+Ch'ng, CK; Quah, SH; Low, HC.+Qual Eng+2005::An approach to a feature-based comparison of solid models of machined parts+Cicirello, VA; Regli, WC+AI EDAM-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN ANALYSIS AND MANUFACTURING+NOV 2002::A study on estimating measurement error in the measurement of earing of pilfer-proof caps+Das, N.+Quality Engineering+2003-2004::Evaluating a well-known criterion for measurement precision+Engel, J; DeVries, B+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 1997::A self-calibration method for robotic measurement system+Gong, CH; Yuan, JX; Ni, J+JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME+FEB 2000::Confidence intervals for unbalanced two factor gauge R&amp;R studies+Gong, LY; Burdick, RK; Quiroz, J+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+DEC 2005::no title+HE BB+MATER SCI FORUM+2000::Applications of multi-variate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to multi-electrode array electrophysiology data+Horton, PM; Bonny, L; Nicol, AU; et al.+JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS+JUL 15 2005::Comparison of different analysis models to measure plastic strains on sheet metal forming parts by digital image processing+Hsu, QC+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE TOOLS &amp; MANUFACTURE+APR 2003::The analysis of feature-based measurement error in coordinate metrology+Huang, WZ; Kong, ZY; Ceglarek, D; et al.+IIE TRANSACTIONS+MAR 2004::no title+JOHNSON, R.

Follow-up designs to resolve confounding in split-plot experiments,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2008,25,3,"Split-plot designs are effective in industry due to time and/or cost constraints, restriction on randomization of the treatment combinations of the hard-to-change factors, and different sizes of experimental units. Some of the results of fractional factorial split-plot experiments can be ambiguous and a need may arise to conduct follow-up experiments to separate effects of potential interest by breaking their alias links with others. For completely randomized fractional factorial experiments, methods have been developed to construct follow-up experiments. In this article, we extend the foldover technique to break the alias chains of split-plot experiments. Because it is impractical or not economically possible to foldover the whole-plot factors, as their levels are often hard or expensive to change, the focus of this article is on folding over only one or more subplot factors in order to de-alias certain effects. Six rules are provided to develop foldovers for minimum aberration resolution III and resolution IV fractional factorial split-plot designs.","alias,foldover design,minimum aberration,reduced defining relation,resolution III designs,resolution IV designs,split-plot design","ROBUST PARAMETER DESIGN,MIXTURE EXPERIMENTS,PROCESS VARIABLES","Almimi, Ashraf A.@Arizona State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA::Kulahci, Murat@Arizona State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA@Tech Univ Denmark, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark::Montgomery, Douglas C.@Arizona State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Almimi, Ashraf A.@Arizona State University::Kulahci, Murat@Technical University of Denmark@Arizona State University::Montgomery, Douglas C.@Arizona State University","kulahci, murat@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4222-9631","Design issues in fractional factorial split-plot experiments+Bingham, DR; Sitter, RR+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2001::The design and analysis of 2(k-p) x 2(q-r) split plot experiments+Bisgaard, S+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2000::The design and analysis of 2(k-p)xs prototype experiments+Bisgaard, S; Steinberg, DM+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1997::Sequential Experimentation and Sequential Assembly of Designs+BOX, G.+Qual.

Monitoring correlation within linear profiles using mixed models,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2008,35,100,"Profile monitoring is a relatively new set of techniques in quality control used when the product or process quality is best represented by a function (or a curve) at each time period. The idea is often to model the profile via some parametric method and then monitor the estimated parameters over time to determine if there have been changes in the profiles. Previous modeling methods have not incorporated a correlation structure within the profiles. We propose the use of linear mixed models to monitor the linear profiles in order to account for any correlation structure within a profile. We conclude that, when the data are balanced, there appears to be no advantage in modeling correlation and/or including random effects because a simpler analysis that ignores the correlation structure will perform just as well as the more complicated analysis. When the data are unbalanced or when there are missing data, we find that the linear mixed model approach is preferable to an approach that ignores the correlation structure. Our focus is on Phase I control-chart applications.","eblups,missing data,mixed models,Multivariate statistical process control,phase 1,T-2 statistic","MULTIVARIATE CONTROL CHARTS,LONGITUDINAL DATA,DIAGNOSTICS","Jensen, Willis A.@WL Gore & Assoc Inc, Med Products Div, Flagstaff, AZ 86003 USA::Birch, Jeffrey B.@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Woodall, William H.@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Jensen, Willis A.@Unknow::Birch, Jeffrey B.@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Woodall, William H.@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University","Woodall, William@A-8094-2009","Influence diagnostics for linear longitudinal models+Banerjee, M; Frees, EW+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1997::Two graphical techniques useful in detecting correlation structure in repeated measures data+Dawson, KS; Gennings, C; Carter, WH+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 1997::no title+Demidenko, E.+Mixed models: theory and applications+2004::Influence analysis for linear mixed-effects models+Demidenko, E; Stukel, TA+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+MAR 30 2005::Performance evaluation of two methods for online monitoring of linear calibration profiles+Gupta, S; Montgomery, DC; Woodall, WH+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH+MAY 15 2006::Consequences of misspecifying assumptions in nonlinear mixed effects models+Hartford, A; Davidian, M+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+AUG 28 2000::no title+HOLMES DS+QUAL ENG+1993::no title+JENSEN WA+0602 STAT U VIRG POL+2006::High breakdown estimation methods for phase I multivariate control charts+Jensen, Willis A.; Birch, Jeffrey B.; Woodall, William H.+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+AUG 2007::On-line monitoring when the process yields a linear profile+Kang, L; Albin, SL+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 2000::On the monitoring of linear profiles+Kim, K; Mahmoud, MA; Woodall, WH+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 2003::RANDOM-EFFECTS MODELS FOR LONGITUDINAL DATA+LAIRD, NM; WARE, JH+BIOMETRICS+1982::Local influence in linear mixed models+Lesaffre, E; Verbeke, G+BIOMETRICS+JUN 1998::no title+Littell, R.

A class of partially replicated two level fractional factorial designs,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2008,17,7,"Resolution III fractional factorial designs permit the uncorrelated estimation of a I I main effects under the assumption of no interactions among the factors and are often used in the initial phases of an experimental program to screen factors. Even in these experimental situations, it may be desirable to include partial replication of the design, thereby allowing for the unbiased estimation of the experimental error while maintaining the orthogonality of the main effects. It is often then possible to assess the no-interactions assumption by comparing the sample of confounded interactions with the pure error estimate. In this paper, a new class of partially replicated two-level fractional factorial designs based on Hadamard matrices is proposed. A method of constructing these designs is given and the relative performance of the designs is evaluated by comparing them with competing fractional factorial designs.","G(2)-aberration,generalized resolution,Hadamard matrix,uniformity","ABERRATION,PLANS","Lupinacci, Paul J.@Villanova Univ, Dept Math Sci, Villanova, PA 19085 USA::Pigeon, Joseph G.@Villanova Univ, Dept Math Sci, Villanova, PA 19085 USA","Lupinacci, Paul J.@Villanova University::Pigeon, Joseph G.@Villanova University",not exist,"no title+BATFS RA+J ROYAL STAT SOC B+1996::no title+Box, G.

Weighted CUSUM chart for detecting patterned mean shifts,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2008,33,20,"Most conventional control charts focus on detecting a constant mean shift. In reality, however, it is often important to deal with situations where the mean of the monitoring sequence has a dynamic shift pattern, e.g., residuals from a time series. In these cases, the conventional control charts may perform poorly, as they do not consider the information due to what is known as ""forecast recovery"" contained in the patterned mean shift. This paper proposes a new weighted cumulative sum (WCUSUM) procedure for monitoring a sequence with a patterned mean shift. This method first estimates the dynamic mean of the sequence, then uses the estimates for weighting the incremental in the conventional CUSUM chart. Guidelines for designing the WCUSUM chart are proposed, and the performance is compared with that of the conventional CUSUM chart and other alternatives for detecting patterned mean shifts. It is found that the WCUSUM chart performs far superior to other charts for detecting small to moderate shifts when forecast recovery is present and performs competitively otherwise.","automatic process control,change-point detection,EWMA,statistical process control","STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,QUALITY-CONTROL SCHEMES,MARKOV-CHAIN MODEL,AUTOCORRELATED PROCESSES,MOVING AVERAGE,RUN-LENGTH,DISTRIBUTIONS","Shu, Lianjie@Univ Macau, Fac Business Adm, Taipa, Peoples R China::Jiang, Wei@Stevens Inst Technol, Dept Syst Engn & Engn Management, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA::Tsui, Kwok-Leung@Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Ind & Syst Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Shu, Lianjie@University of Macau::Jiang, Wei@Stevens Institute of Technology::Tsui, Kwok-Leung@Georgia Institute of Technology@University System of Georgia","Shu, Lianjie@B-7911-2016","TIME-SERIES MODELING FOR STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL+ALWAN, LC; ROBERTS, HV+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JAN 1988::The GLRT for statistical process control of autocorrelated processes+Apley, DW; Shi, J+IIE TRANSACTIONS+SEP 1999::no title+Basseville, M; Nikiforov, I.+Detection of Abrupt Changes: Theory and Applications+1993::STATISTICAL PROCESS MONITORING AND FEEDBACK ADJUSTMENT - A DISCUSSION+BOX, G; KRAMER, T+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 1992::Cumulative score charts+Box, GEP; Ramirez, J.+Quality and Reliability Engineering International+1992::no title+BOX GEP+TIME SERIES ANAL+1976::APPROACH TO PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION OF CUSUM RUN LENGTH+BROOK, D; EVANS, DA+BIOMETRIKA+1972::Change patterns of time series-based control charts+Hu, SJ; Roan, C+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1996::THE EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE+HUNTER, JS+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 1986::Multivariate control charts for monitoring autocorrelated processes+Jiang, W+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 2004::SPC monitoring of MMSE- and PI-controlled processes+Jiang, W; Tsui, KL+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 2002::Combined control charts for forecast-based monitoring schemes+Lin, WSW; Adams, BM+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1996::Cusum charts for monitoring an autocorrelated process+Lu, CW; Reynolds, MR+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 2001::EWMA control charts for monitoring the mean of autocorrelated processes+Lu, CW; Reynolds, MR+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 1999::EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE CONTROL SCHEMES - PROPERTIES AND ENHANCEMENTS+LUCAS, JM; SACCUCCI, MS+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1990::FAST INITIAL RESPONSE FOR CUSUM QUALITY-CONTROL SCHEMES - GIVE YOUR CUSUM A HEAD-START+LUCAS, JM; CROSIER, RB+TECHNOMETRICS+1982::Average run lengths and run length probability distributions for cuscore charts to control normal mean+Luceno, A+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+DEC 28 1999::Cuscore Charts to Detect Level Shifts in Autocorrelated Noise+LUCENO, A.+Quality Technology and Quantitative Management+2004::OPTIMAL STOPPING-TIMES FOR DETECTING CHANGES IN DISTRIBUTIONS+MOUSTAKIDES, GV+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1986::no title+RUNCER CC+QUALITY RELIABILITY+2003::A Markov chain model for the multivariate exponentially weighted moving averages control chart+Runger, GC; Prabhu, SS+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1996::Integrated application of the cumulative score control chart and engineering process control+Shao, YE+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 1998::no title+Shewhart, W.A.+Economic Control of Quality of manufactured Products+1931::A Markov chain model for the adaptive CUSUM control chart+Shu, LJ; Jiang, W+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 2006::CUSUM charts for signalling varying location shifts+Sparks, RS+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 2000::AN EVALUATION OF FORECAST-BASED QUALITY-CONTROL SCHEMES+SUPERVILLE, CR; ADAMS, BM+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+1994::A mean-shift pattern study on integration of SPC and APC for process monitoring+Tsung, FG; Tsui, KL+IIE TRANSACTIONS+MAR 2003::Monitoring processes that wander using integrated moving average models+VanderWiel, SA+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 1996::ALGORITHMIC STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL - CONCEPTS AND AN APPLICATION+VANDERWIEL, SA; TUCKER, WT; FALTIN, FW; et al.+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 1992::RUN-LENGTH DISTRIBUTIONS OF SPECIAL-CAUSE CONTROL CHARTS FOR CORRELATED PROCESSES+WARDELL, DG; MOSKOWITZ, H; PLANTE, RD+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1994::ESTIMATING THE CURRENT MEAN OF A PROCESS SUBJECT TO ABRUPT CHANGES+YASHCHIN, E+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 1995::PERFORMANCE OF CUSUM CONTROL SCHEMES FOR SERIALLY CORRELATED OBSERVATIONS+YASHCHIN, E+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1993::WEIGHTED CUMULATIVE SUM TECHNIQUE+YASHCHIN, E+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 1989"
Multivariate process variability monitoring through projection,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2008,24,6,"Inspired by the recently developed projection chart, such as the U-2 chart for monitoring a shift in the multivariate mean, this article proposes a multivariate projection chart for monitoring process variability. In engineering practice, people often build a linear process model to connect the multivariate quality measurements with a set of fixed assignable causes. The column space of the process model naturally provides a subspace for projection and subsequent monitoring and was indeed used as the projection subspace in the recently developed projection control charts for monitoring a shift the mean. For the purpose of monitoring variability, however, we will show that such a projection may not be advantageous. We propose an alternative projecting statistic, labeled as VS, to be used for constructing a multivariate variability monitoring chart. We show, through extensive numerical studies, that the VS chart entertains several advantages over other competing methods, such as its less restrictive requirements on the process model and generally improved detection performance.","control chart,generalized variance,multivariate process variability,statistical process control","MULTISTAGE MANUFACTURING PROCESSES,VARIATION PROPAGATION,CONTROL CHART,DIAGNOSABILITY,DIAGNOSIS,MODELS","Hao, Shuguang@Univ Wisconsin, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA::Zhou, Shiyu@Univ Wisconsin, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA::Ding, Yu@Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Hao, Shuguang@University of Wisconsin System@University of Wisconsin Madison::Zhou, Shiyu@University of Wisconsin System@University of Wisconsin Madison::Ding, Yu@Texas A&M University College Station@Texas A&M University System",not exist,"Multivariate Quality Control+Alt, F.+Encyclopedia of Statistical Sciences+1985::Multivariate process control+Alt, FB; Smith, ND.+HDB STATISTICS+1988::A, characterization of diagnosability conditions for variance components analysis in assembly operations+Apley, DW; Ding, Y+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING+APR 2005::A factor-analysis method for diagnosing variability in multivariate manufacturing processes+Apley, DW; Shi, JJ+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 2001::Process-oriented basis representations for multivariate process diagnostics+Barton, R.R.; Gonzalez-Barreto, D.R.+Quality Engineering+1996-1997::Fixture failure diagnosis for autobody assembly using pattern recognition+Ceglarek, D; Shi, J+JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING FOR INDUSTRY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME+FEB 1996::A comparison of process variation estimators for in-process dimensional measurements and control+Ding, Y; Zhou, SY; Chen, Y+JOURNAL OF DYNAMIC SYSTEMS MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME+MAR 2005::Diagnosability analysis of multi-station manufacturing processes+Ding, Y; Shi, JJ; Ceglarek, D+JOURNAL OF DYNAMIC SYSTEMS MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME+MAR 2002::Fault diagnosis of multistage manufacturing processes by using state space approach+Ding, Y; Ceglarek, D; Shi, JJ+JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME+MAY 2002::Improved monitoring of multivariate process variability+Djauhari, MA+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2005::Linear state space modeling of dimensional machining errors+Djurdjanovic, D.; Ni, J.+Transactions of the NAMRI/SME XXIX+2001::Asymptotic expansions of the distributions of test statistics in multivariate analysis+Fujikoshi, Yasunori.+J.

Statistical process control for geometric specifications: On the monitoring of roundness profiles,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2008,48,61,"Quality of mechanical components is critically related to both dimensional and geometric specifications. Traditionally, approaches for statistical process control (SPC) focused on the first type of specification only. When the quality of a manufactured product is related to geometric specifications (e.g., profile and form tolerances as straightness, roundness, cylindricity, flatness, etc.), the process should be considered in control if the relationship used to represent that profile or surface in the space is stable over time. This paper presents a novel method for monitoring bidimensional profiles. The proposed method is based on combining a spatial autoregressive regression (SARX) model (i.e., a regression model with spatial autoregressive errors) with control charting. To show the effectiveness of the proposed method, the approach is applied to real process data in which the roundness of items obtained by turning has to be monitored. A simulation study indicates that the proposed approach outperforms competing methods (based on monitoring the out-of-roundness value for each profile) in terms of the average number of samples required to detect out-of-control conditions arising in phase 11 and due to spindle-motion errors.","control charts,geometric tolerance,multivariate control chart,profile monitoring,regression,spatial statistics,SPC","MULTIVARIATE CONTROL CHARTS,COORDINATE MEASURING MACHINE,PHASE-I ANALYSIS,LINEAR PROFILES,INDIVIDUAL OBSERVATIONS,ERROR COMPENSATION,MODELS,PARTS,FCC","Colosimo, Bianca M.@Politecn Milan, Dept Mech Engn, I-20133 Milan, Italy::Semeraro, Quirico@Politecn Milan, Fac Ind Engn, I-20133 Milan, Italy@Politecn Milan, Dept Mech Engn, I-20133 Milan, Italy::Pacella, Massimo@Univ Salento, Dept Ingn Innovaz, I-73100 Lecce, Italy","Colosimo, Bianca M.@Polytechnic University of Milan::Semeraro, Quirico@Polytechnic University of Milan::Pacella, Massimo@University of Salento","Colosimo, Bianca@C-1081-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6844-2030::Pacella, Massimo@I-5561-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3712-7932::Semeraro, Quirico@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1786-0221","no title+BOX G+TIME SERIES ANAL+1994::The harmonic fitting method for the assessment of the substitute geometry estimate error.

Principal alarms in multivariate statistical process control,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2008,20,9,"This paper describes a methodology for the simulation of out-of-control situations using in-control data, for the purpose of identifying the potential alarms that could occur in a multivariate process. The method is based on finding the independent factors of the variability of the process and shifting these factors one by one. The effects of these shifts are then translated in terms of the observed variables. The shifts provoked by the most important factors are called principal alarms. The principal alarms can be plotted, visualizing the main deviations of the process. Also, a resampling procedure for the estimation of the average run length of a control chart using principal alarms is proposed. An application with a real industrial process illustrates the usefulness of the methodology.","average run length,control charts,Hotelling's T-2,MEWMA,multivariate processes,principal components","QUALITY-CONTROL,CONTROL CHARTS,BOOTSTRAP,T-2,VARIABLES","Gonzalez, Isabel@Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Mech Engn, Madrid 28911, Spain::Sanchez, Ismael@Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Stat, Madrid 28911, Spain","Gonzalez, Isabel@Universidad Carlos III de Madrid::Sanchez, Ismael@Universidad Carlos III de Madrid","Gonzalez Farias, Isabel@L-5327-2014::gonzalez farias, isabel@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4097-3558::SANCHEZ, ISMAEL@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7061-7805","Multivariate quality control+Alt, FB.+The encyclopedia of statistical sciences+1984::The use of bootstrapping to construct limits on control charts+Bajgier, S.

Designing and running super-efficient experiments: Optimum blocking with one hard-to-change factor,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2008,38,16,"This paper discusses how to run 2(k) experiments for process improvement when there is one hardto-change factor. The paper studies the different ways of running these experiments and gives practical recommendations. It shows how to block designs to get small prediction variance and low cost. It presents an algorithm to allow the selection of efficient blocking relations, in 2(k) designs, where there is one hard-to-change factor and tabulates the results for 2(3) to 2(7) designs, in various block sizes. It presents methods for calculating the prediction variance and G-efficiency when there are hard-to-change factors. The calculations are demonstrated by applying them to 2(k) designs, and results are tabulated for various block sizes. We show that optimally blocked split-plot designs dominate randomized designs. A blocked split-plot design is both less expensive to run, because it requires fewer resets of the hard-to-change factor, and more precise, as it gives a lower variance of prediction than a completely randomized design.","block size,cost function,expensive-to-change factors,G-efficiency,prediction variance","SPLIT-PLOT EXPERIMENTS,RANDOMIZATION,RESTRICTIONS,STATISTICS","Anbari, Frank T.@George Washington Univ, Dept Decis Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA::Lucas, James M.@JM Lucas & Associates, Wilmington, DE 19808 USA","Anbari, Frank T.@George Washington University::Lucas, James M.@Unknow",not exist,"no title+ANBARI FT+P AM STAT ASS JOINT+2004::no title+ANBARI FT+P ASQ 48 ANN QUAL C+1994::no title+ANBARI FT+THESIS DREXEL U PHIL+1993::RESTRICTION ERRORS - ANOTHER DIMENSION IN TEACHING EXPERIMENTAL STATISTICS+ANDERSON, VL; MCLEAN, RA+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+1974::Fractional factorial split-plot designs for robust parameter experiments+Bingham, D; Sitter, RR+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 2003::Minimum-aberration two-level fractional factorial split-plot designs+Bingham, D; Sitter, RR+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1999::Design issues in fractional factorial split-plot experiments+Bingham, DR; Sitter, RR+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2001::Designing fractional factorial split-plot experiments with few whole-plot factors+Bingham, DR; Schoen, ED; Sitter, RR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2004::The design and analysis of 2(k-p) x 2(q-r) split plot experiments+Bisgaard, S+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2000::no title+FRANKLIN MF+APPLIED STATISTICS+1977::SELECTING DEFINING CONTRASTS AND CONFOUNDED EFFECTS IN PN-M FACTORIAL-EXPERIMENTS+FRANKLIN, MF+TECHNOMETRICS+1985::Bias in test statistics when restrictions in randomization are caused by factors+Ganju, J; Lucas, JM+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1997::Randomized and random run order experiments+Ganju, J; Lucas, JM+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+JUL 1 2005::Detecting randomization restrictions caused by factors+Ganju, J; Lucas, JM+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+OCT 1 1999::no title+GOOS P+J QUAL TECHNOL+2006::Outperforming completely randomized designs+Goos, P; Vandebroek, M+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2004::no title+GREENFIELD AA+APPLIED STATISTICS+1978::no title+GREENFIELD AA+J ROYAL STATISTICAL+1976::L-k factorial experiments with hard-to-change and easy-to-change factors+Ju, HL; Lucas, JM+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 2002::no title+JU HL+THESIS U DELAWARE NE+1992::OPTIMUM DESIGNS IN REGRESSION PROBLEMS .2.+KIEFER, J+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1961::The equivalence of two extremum problems+Kiefer, J.; Wolfowitz, J.+Canad.

Causation-based T-2 decomposition for Multivariate process monitoring and diagnosis,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2008,27,37,"Multivariate process monitoring and diagnosis is an important and challenging issue. The widely adopted Hotelling T-2 control chart can effectively detect a change in a system but is not capable of diagnosing the root causes of the change. The MTY approach makes efforts to improve the diagnosability by decomposing the T-2 statistic. However, this approach is computationally intensive and has a limited capability in root-cause diagnosis for a large dimension of variables. This paper proposes a causation-based T-2 decomposition method that integrates the causal relationships revealed by a Bayesian network with the traditional MTY approach. Theoretical analysis and simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed method substantially reduces the computational complexity and enhances the diagnosability, compared with the MTY approach.","Bayesian network,causal model,SPC","BAYESIAN NETWORKS,QUALITY-CONTROL,VARIABLES","Li, Jing@Arizona State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA::Jin, Jionghua@Univ Michigan, Dept Ind & Operat Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA::Shi, Jianjun@Univ Michigan, Dept Ind & Operat Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Li, Jing@Arizona State University::Jin, Jionghua@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan::Shi, Jianjun@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan","Li, Jing@A-5516-2009","Multivariate quality control+Alt, FB.+Encyclopedia of Statistical Science+1985::Diagnosis of multiple fixture faults in panel assembly+Apley, DW; Shi, J+JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME+NOV 1998::Process-oriented basis representations for multivariate process diagnostics+Barton, R.R.; Gonzalez-Barreto, D.R.+Quality Engineering+1996-1997::A guide to the literature on learning probabilistic networks from data+Buntine, W+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING+APR 1996::Fixture failure diagnosis for autobody assembly using pattern recognition+Ceglarek, D; Shi, J+JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING FOR INDUSTRY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME+FEB 1996::Using Bayesian networks to analyze expression data+Friedman, N; Linial, M; Nachman, I; et al.+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY+2000::REGRESSION ADJUSTMENT FOR VARIABLES IN MULTIVARIATE QUALITY-CONTROL+HAWKINS, DM+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1993::MULTIVARIATE QUALITY-CONTROL BASED ON REGRESSION-ADJUSTED VARIABLES+HAWKINS, DM+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1991::Multivariate quality control+Hotelling, H.+Techniques of statistical analysis+1947::State space modeling of sheet metal assembly for dimensional control+Jin, J; Shi, J+JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME+NOV 1999::no title+Kline, R.

Using hierarchical probability models to evaluate robust parameter design methods,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2008,32,5,"An approach is proposed for evaluating the effectiveness of robust parameter design methods. A hierarchical probability model is presented that enables an investigator to represent assumptions about regularities in system responses such as effect sparsity, hierarchy, and inheritance. The hierarchical probability model is used to create a population of responses to which alternative robust parameter design methods are applied. In a model-based study, product arrays and combined arrays are both applied in simulations of a scenario similar to that in a physical experiment recently published in the literature. The study confirmed the result found in the physical experiment that, in scenarios of this form, product arrays with classical analysis can exploit effects on transmitted variance that interaction analysis and combined arrays often cannot. The model-based approach also enabled investigation into mechanisms by which robust design methods function and into the assumptions critical to their effectiveness.","combined array,product array,response modeling,signal-to-noise ratio","BAYESIAN VARIABLE-SELECTION,LINE QUALITY-CONTROL,FRACTIONAL FACTORIALS,TAGUCHI METHOD,EXPERIMENTATION,ARRAY","Frey, Daniel D.@MIT, Dept Mech Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA@MIT, Engn Syst Div, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA::Li, Xiang@MIT, Dept Mech Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Frey, Daniel D.@Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)::Li, Xiang@Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)",not exist,"Mixed resolution designs as alternatives to Taguchi inner/outer array designs for robust design problems+Borror, CM; Montgomery, DC+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+MAR-APR 2000::SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIOS, PERFORMANCE CRITERIA, AND TRANSFORMATIONS+BOX, G+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1988::Statistics as a catalyst to learning by scientific method part II - A discussion+Box, GEP+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 1999::OFF-LINE QUALITY-CONTROL, PARAMETER DESIGN, AND THE TAGUCHI METHOD - DISCUSSION+BOX, GEP+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 1985::AN ANALYSIS FOR UNREPLICATED FRACTIONAL FACTORIALS+BOX, GEP; MEYER, RD+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1986::Bayesian variable selection with related predictors+Chipman, H+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+MAR 1996::A Bayesian variable-selection approach for analyzing designed experiments with complex aliasing+Chipman, H; Hamada, M; Wu, CFJ+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1997::Use of half-normal plots in interpreting factorial two level experiments+Daniel, C.+Technometrics+1959::PUBLICATION BIAS IN CLINICAL RESEARCH+EASTERBROOK, PJ; BERLIN, JA; GOPALAN, R; et al.+LANCET+APR 13 1991::Adaptive one-factor-at-a-time experimentation and expected value of improvement+Frey, Daniel D.; Wang, Hungjen+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 2006::no title+FREY DD+IN PRESS ASME J MECH+2008::Validation of design methods: lessons from medicine+Frey, DD; Dym, CL+RESEARCH IN ENGINEERING DESIGN+JUN 2006::ANALYSIS OF DESIGNED EXPERIMENTS WITH COMPLEX ALIASING+HAMADA, M; WU, CFJ+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1992::OFF-LINE QUALITY-CONTROL, PARAMETER DESIGN, AND THE TAGUCHI METHOD+KACKAR, RN+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 1985::An experiment to compare Taguchi's product array and the combined array+Kunert, J.; Auer, C.; Erdbruege, M.; et al.+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2007::QUICK AND EASY ANALYSIS OF UNREPLICATED FACTORIALS+LENTH, RV+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1989::Regularities in data from factorial experiments+Li, XA; Sudarsanam, N; Frey, DD+COMPLEXITY+MAY-JUN 2006::Achieving a Robust Process Using Response Surface Methodology, Sesquicentennial Invited Paper Sessions+Lucas, J.

Simulation studies show that the adaptive T-2 chart with EWMA forecasting of mean shifts outperforms most conventional charts in a dynamic environment and is also robust to parameter-estimation uncertainties.","adaptive chart,directionally variant chart,exponentially weighted moving average,Hotelling's T-2 statistic,process dynamics","STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,MULTIVARIATE CONTROL CHARTS,AUTOCORRELATED PROCESSES,ESTIMATED PARAMETERS,QUALITY-CONTROL,SCHEMES,CUSUM","Wang, Kaibo@Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China::Tsung, Fugee@Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Logist Management, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Wang, Kaibo@Tsinghua University::Tsung, Fugee@Hong Kong University of Science & Technology","Wang, Kaibo@G-1640-2012","TIME-SERIES MODELING FOR STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL+ALWAN, LC; ROBERTS, HV+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JAN 1988::The GLRT for statistical process control of autocorrelated processes+Apley, DW; Shi, J+IIE TRANSACTIONS+SEP 1999::The autoregressive T-2 chart for monitoring univariate autocorrelated processes+Apley, DW; Tsung, F+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2002::no title+Baseville, M; Nikiforov, IV.+Detection of abrupt change: theory and application+1993::no title+Box, GEP; Luceno, A.+Statistical Control by Monitoring and Feedback Adjustment+1997::no title+Hamilton,, J.D.+Time Series Analysis+1994::REGRESSION ADJUSTMENT FOR VARIABLES IN MULTIVARIATE QUALITY-CONTROL+HAWKINS, DM+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1993::A joint monitoring scheme for automatically controlled processes+Jiang, W+IIE TRANSACTIONS+DEC 2004::Multivariate control charts for monitoring autocorrelated processes+Jiang, W+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 2004::The run length distribution of the CUSUM with estimated parameters+Jones, LA; Champ, CW; Rigdon, SE+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2004::Combined control charts for forecast-based monitoring schemes+Lin, WSW; Adams, BM+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1996::A REVIEW OF MULTIVARIATE CONTROL CHARTS+LOWRY, CA; MONTGOMERY, DC+IIE TRANSACTIONS+DEC 1995::A MULTIVARIATE EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE CONTROL CHART+LOWRY, CA; WOODALL, WH; CHAMP, CW; et al.+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1992::EWMA control charts for monitoring the mean of autocorrelated processes+Lu, CW; Reynolds, MR+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 1999::Improving the sensitivity of the T-2 statistic in multivariate process control+Mason, RL; Young, JC+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 1999::DECOMPOSITION OF T-2 FOR MULTIVARIATE CONTROL CHART INTERPRETATION+MASON, RL; TRACY, ND; YOUNG, JC+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 1995::SOME STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL METHODS FOR AUTOCORRELATED DATA+MONTGOMERY, DC; MASTRANGELO, CM+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1991::Integrating statistical process monitoring with feedforward control+Montgomery, DC; Keats, JB; Yatskievitch, M; et al.+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+NOV-DEC 2000::Adaptive forecast-based monitoring for dynamic systems+Nembhard, HB; Kao, MS+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 2003::Assignable causes and auto correlation: Control charts for observations or residuals?+Runger, GC+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 2002::Run-length performance of regression control charts with estimated parameters+Shu, LJ; Tsung, F; Tsui, KL+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 2004::The dynamic T-2 chart for monitoring feedback-controlled processes+Tsung, F; Apley, DW+IIE TRANSACTIONS+DEC 2002::On the efficiency and robustness of discrete proportional-integral control schemes+Tsung, F; Wu, HQ; Nair, VN+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 1998::ALGORITHMIC STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL - AN ELABORATION+TUCKER, WT; FALTIN, FW; VANDERWIEL, SA+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1993::no title+WANG K+IN PRESS INT J PRODU+2007::MULTIVARIATE CUSUM QUALITY-CONTROL PROCEDURES+WOODALL, WH; NCUBE, MM+TECHNOMETRICS+1985::LIKELIHOOD RATIO METHODS FOR MONITORING PARAMETERS OF A NESTED RANDOM EFFECT MODEL+YASHCHIN, E+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1995::ANALYSIS OF AUTOCORRELATIONS IN DYNAMIC PROCESSES+ZHANG, NF; POLLARD, JF+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1994::Cycle-based signal monitoring using a directionally variant multivariate control chart system+Zhou, SY; Jin, N; Jin, JH+IIE TRANSACTIONS+NOV 2005"

Run-to-run process adjustment using categorical observations,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2007,35,24,"When quality characteristics cannot be measured on a continuous scale due to either inherent or outside constraints, qualitative observations can be collected alternatively. Under this situation, most conventional run-to-run (R2R) process-control algorithms that are developed based on quantitative measurements cannot be implemented. In this paper, we develop a run-to-run control scheme that uses qualitative information for process adjustments. A two-phase modeling and adjustment strategy is introduced and demonstrated by a real example from a deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) process: model building and parameter estimation is performed in Phase I, and a latent-model control law, a categorical R2R controller, is developed for process regulation in Phase II. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm exhibits competitive control performance, less adjustment effort, and a larger stability region than the conventional exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) controller.","categorical variable,cautious control,exponentially weighted moving average controller,run-to-run process","FEEDFORWARD CONTROL,EWMA CONTROLLER,MODEL,STABILITY,FRAMEWORK,DESIGN,SPC","Wang, Kaibo@Tsinghua Univ, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China@Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Logist Management, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China::Tsung, Fugee@Tsinghua Univ, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China@Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Logist Management, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Wang, Kaibo@Tsinghua University@Hong Kong University of Science & Technology::Tsung, Fugee@Tsinghua University@Hong Kong University of Science & Technology","Wang, Kaibo@G-1640-2012","no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical data analysis+1990::Cautious control of industrial process variability with uncertain input and disturbance model parameters+Apley, DW; Kim, J+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 2004::no title+Astrom, KJ; Wittenmark, B.+Adaptive Control+1995::Characterization of a time multiplexed inductively coupled plasma etcher+Ayon, AA; Braff, R; Lin, CC; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY+JAN 1999::A framework for robust run by run control with lot delayed measurements+Baras, JS; Patel, NS+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING+FEB 1997::SUPERVISORY RUN-TO-RUN CONTROL OF POLYSILICON GATE ETCH USING IN-SITU ELLIPSOMETRY+BUTLER, SW; STEFANI, JA+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING+MAY 1994::no title+CAMPBELL WJ+P AM CONTR C+2002::Measurement system analysis for bounded ordinal data+de Mast, J; van Wieringen, W+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+AUG 2004::Statistical process adjustment: a brief retrospective, current status, and some opportunities for further work+del Castillo, E.+STATISTICA NEERLANDICA+AUG 2006::Run-to-run process control: Literature review and extensions+DelCastillo, E; Hurwitz, AM+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 1997::Stability analysis of double EWMA run-to-run control with metrology delay+Good, R; Qin, SJ+PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2002 AMERICAN CONTROL CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-6+2002::Model-based uniformity control for epitaxial silicon deposition+Gower-Hall, AE; Boning, DS; Rosenthal, P; et al.+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING+AUG 2002::no title+no author+The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction+2001::STABILITY AND SENSITIVITY OF AN EWMA CONTROLLER+INGOLFSSON, A; SACHS, E+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 1993::Online automatic process control using observable noise factors for discrete-part manufacturing+Jin, JH; Ding, Y+IIE TRANSACTIONS+SEP 2004::A process monitoring procedure based on a surrogate variable for dichotomous performance variable+Kwon, HM; Hong, SH; Lee, MK; et al.+IIE TRANSACTIONS+DEC 2001::A PROBABILISTIC AND STATISTICAL VIEW OF FUZZY METHODS+LAVIOLETTE, M; SEAMAN, JW; BARRETT, JD; et al.+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 1995::STATISTICAL EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGN IN PLASMA ETCH MODELING+MAY, GS; HUANG, J; SPANOS, CJ+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING+MAY 1991::Silicon micromachining using a high-density plasma source+McAuley, SA; Ashraf, H; Atabo, L; et al.+JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS+SEP 21 2001::Integrating statistical process monitoring with feedforward control+Montgomery, DC; Keats, JB; Yatskievitch, M; et al.+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+NOV-DEC 2000::A RUN-TO-RUN CONTROL FRAMEWORK FOR VLSI MANUFACTURING+MOYNE, J; ETEMAD, H; ELTA, M+MICROELECTRONIC PROCESSES, SENSORS, AND CONTROLS+1994::Response surface methodology: A retrospective and literature survey+Myers, RH; Montgomery, DC; Vining, GG; et al.+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2004::Control of photoresist properties: A kalman filter based approach+Palmer, E; Ren, W; Spanos, CJ; et al.+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING+MAY 1996::no title+Passino, K.

Tailor-made split-plot designs for mixture and process variables,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2007,32,16,"The design of efficient small experiments involving mixture variables and process variables is a difficult problem. An additional complication is that such experiments are often conducted using split-plot designs and therefore lead to correlated observations. The present article demonstrates how algorithmic search can be used for constructing efficient tailor-made split-plot mixture-process variable designs, when there may be constraints on the mixture components. The D-optimality criterion is used as the main design criterion. The article also shows how to construct efficient split-plot mixture-process variable designs when replication is required for independently estimating the variance components in the split-plot model. It is argued that it is better to spread the replications over different points of the design than to concentrate them in the center.","A-optimality,D-optimality,G-optimality,mixture experiment,pure error estimation,replication,response-surface designs,split-plot experiment,V-optimality","RESPONSE-SURFACE DESIGNS,RANDOMIZATION,COMPONENTS","Goos, Peter@Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium@Univ Manchester, Dept Math, Manchester M60 1QD, Lancs, England::Donev, Alexander N.@Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium@Univ Manchester, Dept Math, Manchester M60 1QD, Lancs, England","Goos, Peter@University of Antwerp@University of Manchester::Donev, Alexander N.@University of Antwerp@University of Manchester","Donev, Alexander@C-6738-2009@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8809-1888","Fractional factorial split-plot designs for robust parameter experiments+Bingham, D; Sitter, RR+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 2003::Minimum-aberration two-level fractional factorial split-plot designs+Bingham, D; Sitter, RR+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1999::Some theoretical results for fractional factorial split-plot designs+Bingham, DR; Sitter, RR+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+AUG 1999::Design issues in fractional factorial split-plot experiments+Bingham, DR; Sitter, RR+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2001::Designing fractional factorial split-plot experiments with few whole-plot factors+Bingham, DR; Schoen, ED; Sitter, RR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2004::The design and analysis of 2(k-p) x 2(q-r) split plot experiments+Bisgaard, S+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2000::The design and analysis of 2(k-p)xs prototype experiments+Bisgaard, S; Steinberg, DM+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1997::A Bayesian variable-selection approach for analyzing designed experiments with complex aliasing+Chipman, H; Hamada, M; Wu, CFJ+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1997::no title+Cornell, J.

Optimal three-level designs for response surfaces in spherical experimental regions,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2007,35,10,"Since 1960, Box-Behnken designs have been very popular with experimenters wishing to estimate a second-order model in three or four factors. This popularity is due to these three-level designs' simplicity and high efficiency. However, as the number of factors increases, the run size of Box-Behnken designs increases rapidly, making them less attractive. The purpose of this article is to recommend the use of D-optimal and l-optimal three-level designs for spherical design regions involving three or more factors. Using an optimal design algorithm offers flexibility of run size. In addition, optimal-design criteria permit construction of second-order designs for more complex response surface applications involving mixture or qualitative factors or requiring split-plot randomization. The restriction to three-level designs provides great practical convenience and often little loss in efficiency, provided the design is not nearly saturated.","box-behnken design,computer experiment,D-Efficiency,I-Efficiency,mixture design,second-order model,split-plot,V-efficiency","PROCESS VARIABLES,CONSTRUCTION,MIXTURE","Mee, Robert W.@Univ Tennessee, Dept Stat Operat & Management Sci, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA","Mee, Robert W.@University of Tennessee System@University of Tennessee Knoxville",not exist,"Sensitivity analysis for high quantiles of ochratoxin A exposure distribution+Albert, I; Gauchi, JP+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD MICROBIOLOGY+MAY 5 2002::no title+Atkinson, A.C.; Donev, A.N.+Optimum Experimental Designs+1992::The usefulness of optimum experimental designs+Atkinson, AC+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1996::Why three-level designs are not so useful for technological experiments+Bisgaard, S.+Quality Engineering+1997::Some new three level second order designs for surface fitting+Box, G.

Evaluating and improving the unit and group-runs chart,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2007,8,9,"A unit and group-runs (UGR) chart is designed to detect the increase in fraction nonconforming (p) under 100% inspection. This chart significantly outperforms all other attribute-control charts in terms of the zero-state average time to signal (ATS(z)). Nonetheless, it has been found that the UGR chart would frequently produce a false alarm within a short time period if the process starts from an in-control status, leading to an undesirable in-control behavior. In addition, the out-of-control performance of the UGR chart under the steady-state mode is also unsatisfactory. This article proposes a method to improve the UGR chart using the steady-state ATS(s) as the objective function. By minimizing ATSs, the in-control performance of the UGR chart, as well as the out-of-control performance under the steady-state mode, could be greatly improved. In the meantime, this UGR chart still performs much more effectively than any other attribute charts if measured by the zero-state ATS(z).","average time to signal,control chart for attributes,false alarm,quality control,statistical process control",,"Wu, Zhang@Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mech & Aerosp Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore::Jiao, Jianxin@Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mech & Aerosp Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore","Wu, Zhang@Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore@Nanyang Technological University::Jiao, Jianxin@Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore@Nanyang Technological University","Wu, Zhang@A-3876-2011::Jiao, Jianxin (Roger)@A-9212-2010","DETECTING A SHIFT IN FRACTION NONCONFORMING USING RUN-LENGTH CONTROL CHARTS WITH 100-PERCENT INSPECTION+BOURKE, PD+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1991::Unit and group-runs chart to identify increases in fraction nonconforming+Grade, M.P.; Rattihalli, R.N.+Journal of Quality Technology+2005::no title+GRADE MP+IAPQR T J INDIAN ASS+2005::no title+Montgomery, D.

Unbalanced and minimal point equivalent estimation second-order split-plot designs,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2007,26,15,"Restricting the randomization of hard-to-change factors in industrial experiments is often required, resulting in a split-plot design structure. From an economic perspective, these designs minimize the experimental cost by reducing the number of resets of the hard-to-change factors. In this paper, unbalanced designs are considered for cases where the subplots are relatively expensive and the experimental apparatus accommodates an unequal number of runs per whole plot. We provide construction methods for unbalanced second-order split-plot designs that possess the equivalent estimation optimality property, providing best linear unbiased estimates of the parameters, independent of the variance components. Unbalanced versions of the central composite and Box-Behnken designs are developed. For cases where the subplot cost approaches the whole-plot cost, minimal point designs are proposed and illustrated with a split-plot Notz design.","box-behnken design,central composite design,equivalent estimation design,Notz design,restricted randomization,split-plot design","RESPONSE-SURFACE DESIGNS,SECOND-ORDER DESIGNS,FACTORIAL,NUMBERS","Parker, Peter A.@Minitab Inc, State Coll, PA 16801 USA@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Kowalski, Scott M.@Minitab Inc, State Coll, PA 16801 USA@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Vining, G.

Optimal designs for mixture-process experiments with control and noise variables,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2007,21,9,"Mixture experiments that involve process variables are widely encountered in industry. When some of the process variables are noise variables, interest focuses on finding levels for the mixture components and the controllable process variables that result in a product that has a desirable mean response and that has small variability in the response transmitted from the noise variables. This is a variation of the robust parameter design problem. Choosing an appropriate experimental design for this type of problem is addressed in the paper. We show how designs that have small prediction variance for the mean and the slope variance can be obtained. We also show how designs that are robust to the level of interaction between control and noise variables can be constructed.","mixture-process experiment,response surface methodology,robust parameter design","RESPONSE-SURFACE METHODOLOGY,GENETIC ALGORITHMS,ROBUST,MODELS,ERRORS","Chung, Peter J.@Merrill Lynch & Co Inc, Scottsdale, AZ 85254 USA@Dial Corp, Scottsdale, AZ 85254 USA@Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA::Goldfarb, Heidi B.@Merrill Lynch & Co Inc, Scottsdale, AZ 85254 USA@Dial Corp, Scottsdale, AZ 85254 USA@Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA::Montgomery, Douglas C.@Merrill Lynch & Co Inc, Scottsdale, AZ 85254 USA@Dial Corp, Scottsdale, AZ 85254 USA@Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Chung, Peter J.@Unknow@Unknow@Arizona State University::Goldfarb, Heidi B.@Unknow@Unknow@Arizona State University::Montgomery, Douglas C.@Unknow@Unknow@Arizona State University",not exist,"Using a genetic algorithm to generate small exact response surface designs+Borkowski, J.J.+J.

A two-stage cumulative quantity control chart for monitoring Poisson processes,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2007,18,6,"This paper is concerned with the cumulative quantity control chart (CQC chart) defined based on the gamma random variable that is the quantity of product inspected in order to observe r (>= 1) nonconformities. A CQC chart with a small value of r has a smaller average run length (ARL), but has lower discriminating power for detecting shifts in the nonconforming rate A than a CQC chart with a large r. In the present paper, inspired by the concepts of double sampling procedures in acceptance sampling as well as reduced inspection in MIL-STD-105E and the procedures for CSP plans in MIL-STD-1235C, a two-stage CQC chart is proposed aiming at gaining both the advantages of the 1-stage CQC charts with r = 1 and r = 2. The authors apply a rigorous analytic approach to perform sensitivity analysis to compare the discriminating power of CQC charts in detecting change in A, rather than using the less rigorous approach of numerical verification based on an ac hoc choice of values of parameters. The authors also obtain and compare the analytic expressions for the ARLs of these CQC charts. Economic analysis of the CQC charts is performed. Numerical examples will be given to compare the performance of these control charts in terms of discriminating power (in detecting shift of A), ARL, and average total cost, and to show that each of these charts could be the best choice in each specific situation. It is also shown that, when the penalty cost due to nonconformities is relatively low, it is optimal not to apply statistical process control at all.","average quantity inspected,average run length,CQC chart,economic design,gamma random variable,statistical process control,two-stage control chart","ECONOMIC DESIGN,DECISION PROCEDURE","Chan, Ling-Yau@Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China::Ouyang, Jintao@Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China::Lau, Henry Ying-Kei@Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Chan, Ling-Yau@University of Hong Kong::Ouyang, Jintao@University of Hong Kong::Lau, Henry Ying-Kei@University of Hong Kong",not exist,"QUALITY-CONTROL TECHNIQUES FOR ZERO DEFECTS+CALVIN, TW+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPONENTS HYBRIDS AND MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY+1983::Two stage control charts for high yield processes+Chan, L.

Profile charts for monitoring lumber manufacturing using laser range sensor data,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2007,34,10,"Real-time technologies using noncontact laser range sensors (LRS) have recently been introduced to improve statistical process control (SPC) programs in automated lumber mills by greatly increasing the volume of data available for SPC. However, present SPC procedures based on sampling theory developed for manual data collection do not fully utilize data from these systems. A new system of control charts is introduced here that simultaneously monitors multiple lumber surfaces and specifically targets three common sawing defects (taper, snipe/flare, and snake). Nontraditional control charts are suggested based on the decomposition of LRS measurements into trend, waviness, and roughness. The proposed charts can be used to monitor the slope parameter of a multiple linear regression model and the peak-to-peak waviness of observations from each board. Applying these methods should lead to process improvements in sawmills by better detecting common sawing problems and identifying the causes.","linear regression,normormal data,profile monitoring,quantile chart,sawing defects,Shewhart control chart,SPC,wood processing","STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,DISTRIBUTIONS,ROUGHNESS,SURFACE","Staudhammer, Christina@Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA@Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada::Maness, Thomas C.@Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA@Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada::Kozak, Robert A.@Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA@Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Staudhammer, Christina@State University System of Florida@University of Florida@University of British Columbia::Maness, Thomas C.@State University System of Florida@University of Florida@University of British Columbia::Kozak, Robert A.@State University System of Florida@University of Florida@University of British Columbia",not exist,"no title+COLEMAN DE+STAT PROCESS CONTROL+1989::Development of a parameter to reflect the roughness of a wood surface that corresponds to tactile roughness - A novel filter to exclude local valleyeffects+Fujiwara, Y; Fujii, Y; Sawada, Y; et al.+HOLZ ALS ROH-UND WERKSTOFF+OCT 2001::no title+FUNCK JW+IND METROLOGY+1992::no title+FUNCK JW+SPIE+1992::Control charts for quantile function values+Grimshaw, SD; Alt, FB+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 1997::no title+KANG L+J QUAL TECHNOL+2000::Economic modeling for statistical process control+Keats, JB; DelCastillo, E; VonCollani, E; et al.+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 1997::On the monitoring of linear profiles+Kim, K; Mahmoud, MA; Woodall, WH+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 2003::no title+LEMASTER RL+14 INT WOOD MACH SEM+1999::Watch out for nonnormal distributions of impurities+Levinson, WA+CHEMICAL ENGINEERING PROGRESS+MAY 1997::Phase I analysis of linear profiles with calibration applications+Mahmoud, M.

Construction of efficient mixed-level fractional factorial designs,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2007,29,6,"Mixed-level factorial experimental designs involve factors with different numbers of levels. Full factorial designs require runs at all possible combinations of the factor levels. As the number of factors and/or factor levels increases, the total number of experiments increases dramatically. As a result, interest has focused on developing orthogonal or near-orthogonal mixed-level fractional factorial designs. Currently existing mixed-level designs are all balanced. However, relaxing the requirement of balance may result in a reduced number of experimental runs in practice. The objective of this paper is to develop mixed-level fractional factorial designs with economical run sizes that are as nearly balanced and orthogonal as possible. A new criterion is developed to assess the degree of near-balance for comparing and constructing designs. A modified J(2)-optimality criterion is used for evaluating design near orthogonality. These criteria are combined and used to assess different design alternatives. Three algorithms are then compared and used to build designs with desirable combinations of near balance and near orthogonality.","columnwise-pairwise algorithm,coordinate exchange algorithm,design of experiments,desirable properties,genetic algorithm,orthogonality","GENETIC ALGORITHM APPROACH,ORTHOGONAL ARRAYS,SUPERSATURATED DESIGNS,ABERRATION DESIGNS,SMALL RUNS,OPTIMALITY","Guo, Yong@Florida State Univ, Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, Tallahassee, FL 32310 USA::Simpson, James R.@Florida State Univ, Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, Tallahassee, FL 32310 USA::Pignatiello, Joseph J., Jr.@Florida State Univ, Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, Tallahassee, FL 32310 USA","Guo, Yong@State University System of Florida@Florida State University::Simpson, James R.@State University System of Florida@Florida State University::Pignatiello, Joseph J., Jr.@State University System of Florida@Florida State University",not exist,"THE CONSTRUCTION OF EXACT D-OPTIMUM EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGNS WITH APPLICATION TO BLOCKING RESPONSE-SURFACE DESIGNS+ATKINSON, AC; DONEV, AN+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1989::SOME SYSTEMATIC SUPERSATURATED DESIGNS+BOOTH, KHV; COX, DR+TECHNOMETRICS+1962::Using a genetic algorithm to generate small exact response surface designs+Borkowski, J.J.+J.

Monitoring multivariate process variability for individual observations,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2007,25,44,"Most of the existing control charts for monitoring multivariate process variability are based on subgroup sizes greater than one. In many practical applications, however, only individual observations are available and the usual control charts are not applicable in these cases. In this paper, two new control charts are proposed to monitor multivariate process variability for individual observations. The proposed control charts are constructed based on the traces of the estimated covariance matrices derived from the individual observations. When there is only one quality characteristic, these two charts respectively reduce to the exponentially weighted mean squared deviation and exponentially weighted moving variance charts. It is shown based on the simulation studies that the proposed charts are superior to the existing ones in detecting increases in variance and changes in correlation. An example from the semiconductor industry is also presented to illustrate the applicability of the proposed charts.","covariance matrix,exponentially weighted moving average,individual observations,trace","EWMA CONTROL CHART,QUALITY-CONTROL,COVARIANCE-MATRIX,MEAN VECTOR,VARIABLES,CUSUM","Huwang, Longcheen@Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Hsinchu 30043, Taiwan@Bowling Green State Univ, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA@Feng Chia Univ, Taichung 40724, Taiwan::Yeh, Arthur B.@Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Hsinchu 30043, Taiwan@Bowling Green State Univ, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA@Feng Chia Univ, Taichung 40724, Taiwan::Wu, Chien-Wei@Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Hsinchu 30043, Taiwan@Bowling Green State Univ, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA@Feng Chia Univ, Taichung 40724, Taiwan","Huwang, Longcheen@National Tsing Hua University@Bowling Green State University@Feng Chia University::Yeh, Arthur B.@National Tsing Hua University@Bowling Green State University@Feng Chia University::Wu, Chien-Wei@National Tsing Hua University@Bowling Green State University@Feng Chia University","Wu, Chien-Wei@J-9099-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7965-1997","SPC for dispersion for multivariate data+Alt, F.B.; Bedewi, G.+ASQC QUAL C T+1986::Multivariate quality control+Alt, FB.+The encyclopedia of statistical sciences+1984::Multivariate process control+Alt, FB; Smith, ND.+HDB STATISTICS+1988::no title+Anderson, T.+An Introdiction to Multivariate Statistical Analysis+1984::REGRESSION ADJUSTMENT FOR VARIABLES IN MULTIVARIATE QUALITY-CONTROL+HAWKINS, DM+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1993::A CUSUM FOR A SCALE PARAMETER+HAWKINS, DM+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+1981::DETECTION OF ERRORS IN MULTIVARIATE DATA USING PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS+HAWKINS, DM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1974::MULTIVARIATE QUALITY-CONTROL BASED ON REGRESSION-ADJUSTED VARIABLES+HAWKINS, DM+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1991::MULTIVARIATE QUALITY-CONTROL+JACKSON, JE+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1985::no title+JOSHI M+STAT CASE STUDIES IN+1997::A REVIEW OF MULTIVARIATE CONTROL CHARTS+LOWRY, CA; MONTGOMERY, DC+IIE TRANSACTIONS+DEC 1995::A MULTIVARIATE EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE CONTROL CHART+LOWRY, CA; WOODALL, WH; CHAMP, CW; et al.+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1992::THE EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING VARIANCE+MACGREGOR, JF; HARRIS, TJ+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 1993::no title+Montgomery, D.

A new design criterion for robust parameter experiments,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2007,29,4,"Varying noise factors in an experiment allows us to find robust conditions against such variation. The levels of the noise factors need to be selected carefully. Levels that are too wide may be infeasible or too costly, and if too narrow they may not provide a good model for prediction and control purposes. We propose a noise-factor separation (NFS) criterion for designs used in robust parameter design, in which a design is preferred to another if it provides the same expected mean square error for the noise part of the fitted model but for a smaller range of the noise factors in uncoded units. We evaluate several experimental designs that can be used to fit a response model that is quadratic in the controllable factors and also contains noise main effects and noise X control interactions. It is shown how the new criterion is related to variance dispersion graphs for the slope and may be used in conjunction with these graphs to assess a given experimental design. The new criterion is incorporated into an optimization formulation used to find new three-level designs that also includes traditional design criteria, such a D-efficiency. A Genetic algorithm was developed to solve such formulation. It is shown how the new designs are competitive in terms of design size, noise-factor separation, and variance dispersion for the mean and slope with respect to composite mixed resolution designs.","design optimality,genetic algorithms,noise factors,robust parameter design","RESPONSE-SURFACE METHODOLOGY,SECOND-ORDER DESIGNS,NOISE VARIABLES,GENETIC ALGORITHMS,MIXED RESOLUTION","Del Castillo, Enrique@Penn State Univ, Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA@Univ Navarra, Sch Engn, San Sebastian, Spain::Alvarez, Maria Jesus@Penn State Univ, Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA@Univ Navarra, Sch Engn, San Sebastian, Spain::Ilzarbe, Laura@Penn State Univ, Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA@Univ Navarra, Sch Engn, San Sebastian, Spain::Viles, Elizabeth@Penn State Univ, Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA@Univ Navarra, Sch Engn, San Sebastian, Spain","Del Castillo, Enrique@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University@University of Navarra::Alvarez, Maria Jesus@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University@University of Navarra::Ilzarbe, Laura@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University@University of Navarra::Viles, Elizabeth@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University@University of Navarra",not exist,"no title+Bazaraa, M.S.; Sherali, H.D.; Shetty, C.M.+Nonlinear Programming Theory and Algorithms+1993::A class of optimal robust parameter designs+Bingham, DR; Li, W+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 2002::Designs of mixed resolution for process robustness studies+Borkowski, JJ; Lucas, JM+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1997::Evaluation of statistical designs for experiments involving noise variables+Borror, CM; Montgomery, DC; Myers, RH+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2002::Mixed resolution designs as alternatives to Taguchi inner/outer array designs for robust design problems+Borror, CM; Montgomery, DC+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+MAR-APR 2000::no title+Box, G.E.P.; Draper, H.R.+Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces+1987::Some new three level designs for the study of quantitative variables+Box, G.

An optimal filter design approach to statistical process control,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2007,27,11,"Many control charts can be viewed as charting the output of a linear filter applied to process data, with an alarm sounded when the filter output falls outside a set of control limits. We generalize this concept by considering a linear filter in its most general time-invariant form. We provide a strategy for optimizing the filter coefficients in order to minimize the out-of-control ARL, while constraining the in-control ARL to some desired value. The optimal linear filters exhibit a number of interesting characteristics, in particular when the process data are autocorrelated. In many situations, they also substantially outperform an optimally designed exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control chart.","autocorrelation,control charts,linear filtering,Markov chain method,statistical process control","CONTROL CHARTS,AUTOCORRELATED PROCESSES,RUN-LENGTH,CONTROL SCHEMES,CUSCORE CHARTS,DISTRIBUTIONS,VARIANCE","Apley, Daniel W.@Northwestern Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Management Sci, Evanston, IL 60208 USA@Kyung Hee Univ, Sch Mech & Ind Syst Engn, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea::Chin, Chang-Ho@Northwestern Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Management Sci, Evanston, IL 60208 USA@Kyung Hee Univ, Sch Mech & Ind Syst Engn, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea","Apley, Daniel W.@Northwestern University@Kyung Hee University::Chin, Chang-Ho@Northwestern University@Kyung Hee University","Apley, Daniel@B-7454-2009","The GLRT for statistical process control of autocorrelated processes+Apley, DW; Shi, J+IIE TRANSACTIONS+SEP 1999::no title+BOX G+TIME SERIES ANAL+1994::Cumulative score charts+Box, GEP; Ramirez, J.+Quality and Reliability Engineering International+1992::no title+Box, GEP; Luceno, A.+Statistical Control by Monitoring and Feedback Adjustment+1997::APPROACH TO PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION OF CUSUM RUN LENGTH+BROOK, D; EVANS, DA+BIOMETRIKA+1972::no title+CHIN C+THESIS TEXAS A M U+2004::Optimal design of second-order linear filters for control charting+Chin, Chang-Ho; Apley, Daniel W.+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 2006::Proportional integral derivative charts for process monitoring+Jiang, W; Wu, HQ; Tsung, FG; et al.+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 2002::A new SPC monitoring method: The ARMA chart+Jiang, W; Tsui, KL; Woodall, WH+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 2000::no title+Johnson, R.

A general Multivariate exponentially weighted moving-average control chart,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2007,11,14,"This paper proposes a general multivariate exponentially weighted moving-average (MEWMA) chart in which the smoothing matrix is full, rather than having only diagonal elements. The average run-length properties of this scheme are examined for a diverse set of quality-control environments. The performance of the scheme is measured by estimating the ARL and comparing it with that of the traditional diagonal multivariate EWMA chart. The comparison shows that allowing nonzero off-diagonal elements in the weight matrix of the new chart can improve MEWMA performance compared with the current standard of a diagonal weight matrix. In particular, there can be a substantial improvement when the process shifts out of control in the start-up stage. The performance of the chart is illustrated with some medical data. Univariate methods are far inferior to multivariate methods on this data set, and the full MEWMA chart proposed outperforms the diagonal MEWMA chart.","affine invariance,general smoothing matrix,inertia",CONTROL SCHEMES,"Hawkins, Douglas M.@Univ Minnesota, Sch Stat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA@Kyungwon Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Songnam, Kyungki Do, South Korea::Choi, Sungwoon@Univ Minnesota, Sch Stat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA@Kyungwon Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Songnam, Kyungki Do, South Korea::Lee, Sanghoon@Univ Minnesota, Sch Stat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA@Kyungwon Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Songnam, Kyungki Do, South Korea","Hawkins, Douglas M.@University of Minnesota Twin Cities@University of Minnesota System@Gachon University::Choi, Sungwoon@University of Minnesota Twin Cities@University of Minnesota System@Gachon University::Lee, Sanghoon@University of Minnesota Twin Cities@University of Minnesota System@Gachon University",not exist,"no title+CROWDER SV+J QUAL TECHNOL+1989::no title+CULLEN CG+MATRICES LINEAR TRAN+1972::no title+Hawkins, D.

Two-stage controlled fractional factorial screening for simulation experiments,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2007,14,6,"Factor screening with statistical control makes sense in the context of simulation experiments that have random error, but can be run automatically on a computer and thus can accommodate a large number of replications. The discrete-event simulations common in the operations research field are well suited to controlled screening. In this paper, two methods of factor screening with control of Type I error and power are compared. The two screening methods are both robust with respect to two-factor interactions and nonconstant variance. The first method is an established sequential method called controlled sequential bifurcation for interactions (CSB-X). The second method uses a fractional factorial design in combination with a two-stage procedure for controlling power. The two-stage controlled fractional factorial (TCFF) method requires less prior information and is more efficient when the percentage of important factors is 5% or higher.","computer experiments,design of experiments,discrete-event simulation,factor screening,sequential bifurcation",,"Wan, Hong@Purdue Univ, Sch Ind Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA@Northwestern Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Management Sci, Evanston, IL 60208 USA::Ankenman, Bruce E.@Purdue Univ, Sch Ind Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA@Northwestern Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Management Sci, Evanston, IL 60208 USA","Wan, Hong@Purdue University System@Purdue University@Northwestern University::Ankenman, Bruce E.@Purdue University System@Purdue University@Northwestern University","Ankenman, Bruce@B-7453-2009","no title+Banks, J; Carson, J.

Bootstrap methods are used to gauge the estimation uncertainty, and optimal decisions for system replacement are determined based on the observed likelihood.","bootstrap sampling,EM algorithm,failure truncation,maximum likelihood,minimal repair,warranty","MODEL,RELIABILITY","Wang, Ni@Capital One Serv Inc, Glen Allen, VA 23060 USA@Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Ind & Syst Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA::Kvam, Paul@Capital One Serv Inc, Glen Allen, VA 23060 USA@Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Ind & Syst Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA::Lu, Jye-Chyi@Capital One Serv Inc, Glen Allen, VA 23060 USA@Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Ind & Syst Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Wang, Ni@Unknow@University System of Georgia@Georgia Institute of Technology::Kvam, Paul@Unknow@University System of Georgia@Georgia Institute of Technology::Lu, Jye-Chyi@Unknow@University System of Georgia@Georgia Institute of Technology",not exist,"Reliability analysis for complex systems+Crow, LH.+Reliability and biometry+1974::LEARNING CURVE APPROACH TO RELIABILITY MONITORING+DUANE, JT+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AEROSPACE+1964::STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS OF A COMPOUND POWER-LAW MODEL FOR REPAIRABLE SYSTEMS+ENGELHARDT, M; BAIN, LJ+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY+OCT 1987::Using bootstrap likelihood ratios in finite mixture models+Feng, ZD; McCulloch, CE+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1996::CONFIDENCE BOUNDS ON PARAMETERS OF WEIBULL PROCESS+FINKELSTEIN, JM+TECHNOMETRICS+1976::no title+GAUDOIN O+CONFIDENCE INTERVALS+2004::Estimating distributions with increasing failure rate in an imperfect repair model+Kvam, PH; Singh, H; Whitaker, LR+LIFETIME DATA ANALYSIS+MAR 2002::COMPARING RATES OF SEVERAL INDEPENDENT WEIBULL PROCESSES+LEE, L+TECHNOMETRICS+1980::no title+Lehmann, EL.+Testing statistical hypotheses+1997::no title+LEHTO S+LEMON LAW BIBLE+2000::no title+MAJESKE KD+REL MAINT S P ANN+1995::A mixture model for automobile warranty data+Majeske, KD+RELIABILITY ENGINEERING &amp; SYSTEM SAFETY+JUL 2003::no title+McLachlan, G.

A control chart for the coefficient of variation,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2007,10,36,"Monitoring variability is a vital part of modern statistical process control. The conventional Shewhart R and S charts address the setting where the in-control process readings have a constant variance. In some settings, however, it is the coefficient of variation, rather than the variance, that should be constant. For example, this setting is common in clinical chemistry, and then conventional R and S charts cannot be used. This paper develops a chart, equivalent to the S chart, for monitoring the coefficient of variation using rational groups of observations.","clinical chemistry,process variability,statistical process control",,"Kang, Chang W.@Hanyang Univ, Dept Informat & Ind Engn, Ansan 426791, South Korea@LG PHILIPS LCD, Qual Planning Team, Paju 413779, South Korea@Gyeonggi Res Inst, Dept Reg Econ & Soc, Suwon 440290, South Korea@Univ Minnesota, Sch Stat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA::Lee, Man S.@Hanyang Univ, Dept Informat & Ind Engn, Ansan 426791, South Korea@LG PHILIPS LCD, Qual Planning Team, Paju 413779, South Korea@Gyeonggi Res Inst, Dept Reg Econ & Soc, Suwon 440290, South Korea@Univ Minnesota, Sch Stat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA::Seong, Young J.@Hanyang Univ, Dept Informat & Ind Engn, Ansan 426791, South Korea@LG PHILIPS LCD, Qual Planning Team, Paju 413779, South Korea@Gyeonggi Res Inst, Dept Reg Econ & Soc, Suwon 440290, South Korea@Univ Minnesota, Sch Stat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA::Hawkins, Douglas M.@Hanyang Univ, Dept Informat & Ind Engn, Ansan 426791, South Korea@LG PHILIPS LCD, Qual Planning Team, Paju 413779, South Korea@Gyeonggi Res Inst, Dept Reg Econ & Soc, Suwon 440290, South Korea@Univ Minnesota, Sch Stat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Kang, Chang W.@Hanyang University@Philips@LG Electronics@Unknow@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities::Lee, Man S.@Hanyang University@Philips@LG Electronics@Unknow@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities::Seong, Young J.@Hanyang University@Philips@LG Electronics@Unknow@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities::Hawkins, Douglas M.@Hanyang University@Philips@LG Electronics@Unknow@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities",not exist,"no title+Abramowitz, M.

Optimal monitoring of multivariate data for fault patterns,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2007,58,16,"A process-oriented basis representation can be used to express multivariate quality vectors as linear combinations of fault patterns, plus a residual. Monitoring the estimated coefficients of the linear relationship is especially useful when the quality vector contains measurements of the same unit at different locations on a part or other types of profile data. To use process-oriented methods for monitoring changes in the mean of the quality vector, one needs to identify whether the effects occur only as special causes or also as common causes of variation. The calculation of process-oriented model coefficients is shown for each case. In general, the coefficients must be computed by weighted least squares, but we show that, in some circumstances, the ordinary least squares estimates are equivalent. In such cases, charting the proposed U-2 statistic is equivalent to charting a T-2 statistic computed from the process-oriented coefficients, making the process-oriented statistical process control (SPC) statistic optimal in the sense of being most powerful for detecting mean shifts in the process-oriented space. When there are fewer cause-related patterns than the number of elements in the quality vector, the process-oriented basis is incomplete. In this case, the SPC methods are applied in a subspace of the original quality vector space. For some practical examples, it is shown that the process-oriented basis representation approach yields substantially better average run-length performance compared with the usual T-2 chart applied to the original quality vectors.","control charts,multivariate quality control,profile monitoring,SPC,statistical process control","MULTISTAGE MANUFACTURING PROCESSES,OPERATIONAL MACHINING PROCESSES,ROOT-CAUSE IDENTIFICATION,PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS,CONTROL CHARTS,QUALITY-CONTROL,DIAGNOSIS,VARIANCE,PROFILES,(X)OVER-BAR","Runger, George C.@Arizona State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA@Penn State Univ, Dept Supply Chain & Informat Syst, University Pk, PA 16802 USA@Penn State Univ, Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA@Virginia Tech, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Barton, Russell R.@Arizona State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA@Penn State Univ, Dept Supply Chain & Informat Syst, University Pk, PA 16802 USA@Penn State Univ, Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA@Virginia Tech, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Del Castillo, Enrique@Arizona State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA@Penn State Univ, Dept Supply Chain & Informat Syst, University Pk, PA 16802 USA@Penn State Univ, Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA@Virginia Tech, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Woodall, William H.@Arizona State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA@Penn State Univ, Dept Supply Chain & Informat Syst, University Pk, PA 16802 USA@Penn State Univ, Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA@Virginia Tech, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Runger, George C.@Arizona State University@Penn State University@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Barton, Russell R.@Arizona State University@Penn State University@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Del Castillo, Enrique@Arizona State University@Penn State University@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Woodall, William H.@Arizona State University@Penn State University@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University","Woodall, William@A-8094-2009","Diagnosis of multiple fixture faults in panel assembly+Apley, DW;

Bayesian modeling of accelerated life tests with random effects,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2007,19,16,"We show how to use Bayesian methods to make inferences from an accelerated life test where the test units come from different groups (such as batches) and the group effect is random and significant both statistically and practically. Our approach can handle multiple random effects and several accelerating factors. We illustrate the method with an application concerning pressure vessels wrapped in Kevlar 49 fibers, where the fiber of each vessel comes from a single spool and the spool effect is random. We show how Bayesian analysis using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods is used to answer questions of interest in accelerated life tests with random effects that are not as easily answered with more traditional frequentist methods. For example, we can predict the lifetime of a pressure vessel wound with a Kevlar 49 fiber either from a spool used in the accelerated life test or from another random spool from the population of spools. We comment on the implications that this analysis has on the estimates of reliability (and safety) for the Space Shuttle, which has a system of 22 such pressure vessels. Our approach is implemented in the freely available WinBUGS software so that readers can apply the method to their own data.","credibility interval,Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC),prediction interval,quantile,WinBUGS",,"Leon, Ramon V.@Univ Tennessee, Dept Stat Operat & Management Sci, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA@Univ Tennessee, Dept Stat, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA@BlueCross BlueShield Tennessee, Chattanooga, TN 37402 USA@Comscore Networks Inc, Adv Analyt, Chicago, IL 60661 USA::Ramachandran, Ravichandran@Univ Tennessee, Dept Stat Operat & Management Sci, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA@Univ Tennessee, Dept Stat, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA@BlueCross BlueShield Tennessee, Chattanooga, TN 37402 USA@Comscore Networks Inc, Adv Analyt, Chicago, IL 60661 USA::Ashby, Avery J.@Univ Tennessee, Dept Stat Operat & Management Sci, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA@Univ Tennessee, Dept Stat, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA@BlueCross BlueShield Tennessee, Chattanooga, TN 37402 USA@Comscore Networks Inc, Adv Analyt, Chicago, IL 60661 USA::Thyagarajan, Jayanth@Univ Tennessee, Dept Stat Operat & Management Sci, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA@Univ Tennessee, Dept Stat, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA@BlueCross BlueShield Tennessee, Chattanooga, TN 37402 USA@Comscore Networks Inc, Adv Analyt, Chicago, IL 60661 USA","Leon, Ramon V.@University of Tennessee Knoxville@University of Tennessee System@University of Tennessee Knoxville@University of Tennessee System@Unknow@Unknow::Ramachandran, Ravichandran@University of Tennessee Knoxville@University of Tennessee System@University of Tennessee Knoxville@University of Tennessee System@Unknow@Unknow::Ashby, Avery J.@University of Tennessee Knoxville@University of Tennessee System@University of Tennessee Knoxville@University of Tennessee System@Unknow@Unknow::Thyagarajan, Jayanth@University of Tennessee Knoxville@University of Tennessee System@University of Tennessee Knoxville@University of Tennessee System@Unknow@Unknow",not exist,"EXPLAINING THE GIBBS SAMPLER+CASELLA, G; GEORGE, EI+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 1992::UNDERSTANDING THE METROPOLIS-HASTINGS ALGORITHM+CHIB, S; GREENBERG, E+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+NOV 1995::no title+Congdon, P.+Applied Bayesian modeling+2003::no title+Congdon, P.+Bayesian Statistical Modeling+2001::no title+Crowder, MJ; Kimber, AC; Smith, RL.+Statistical analysis of reliability data+1991::Reliability of space-shuttle pressure vessels with random batch effects+Feiveson, AH; Kulkarni, PM+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 2000::no title+Gamerman, D.+Markov Chain Monte Carlo: Stochastic Simulation for Bayesian Inference+1997::SAMPLING-BASED APPROACHES TO CALCULATING MARGINAL DENSITIES+GELFAND, AE; SMITH, AFM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1990::no title+Gelman, A.; Carlin, J.

An experiment to compare Taguchi's product array and the combined array,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2007,18,16,"In robust parameter design, experimenters try to optimize a process by moving the mean to the target value and simultaneously reducing the variance. Factors that influence the mean and factors that influence the variance are determined in a designed experiment. For this experiment, Taguchi (see, e.g., Taguchi and Wu (1985)) proposed the use of a product array, where, for each combination of the design factors, the same array of noise factors is run. To identify effects on the variance, he proposed analyzing summary statistics based on the means and the variances of the response Over the noise array. As an alternative, statisticians (see, e.g., Shoemaker, Tsui, and Wu (1991)) propose using a combined array of design and noise factors and analyzing the interactions between both kinds of factors. We have run an experiment (as part of a joint research project between mechanical engineers and statisticians) where we have done both designs simultaneously. In our experiment, the product array found an effect on the variance that cannot be seen from the combined array. An explanation for this might be that, at least in our example, the effect on the variance cannot be attributed to just a small number of low-order interactions.","design factor,factor sparsity,interaction analysis,noise factor,robust parameter design,signal-to-noise ratio","ROBUST-DESIGN EXPERIMENTS,PARAMETER DESIGN,NOISE FACTORS","Kunert, J.@Univ Dortmund, Dept Stat, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany@Univ Dortmund, Inst Forming Technol & Lightweight Construct, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany::Auer, C.@Univ Dortmund, Dept Stat, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany@Univ Dortmund, Inst Forming Technol & Lightweight Construct, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany::Erdbruege, M.@Univ Dortmund, Dept Stat, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany@Univ Dortmund, Inst Forming Technol & Lightweight Construct, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany::Ewers, R.@Univ Dortmund, Dept Stat, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany@Univ Dortmund, Inst Forming Technol & Lightweight Construct, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany","Kunert, J.@Dortmund University of Technology@Dortmund University of Technology::Auer, C.@Dortmund University of Technology@Dortmund University of Technology::Erdbruege, M.@Dortmund University of Technology@Dortmund University of Technology::Ewers, R.@Dortmund University of Technology@Dortmund University of Technology",not exist,"Comparison of multivariate methods for robust parameter design in sheet metal spinning+Auer, C; Erdbrugge, M; Gobel, R+APPLIED STOCHASTIC MODELS IN BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY+JUL-SEP 2004::SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIOS, PERFORMANCE CRITERIA, AND TRANSFORMATIONS+BOX, G+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1988::DISPERSION EFFECTS FROM FRACTIONAL DESIGNS+BOX, GEP; MEYER, RD+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1986::ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF ACTIVE CONTRASTS IN UNREPLICATED FRACTIONAL FACTORIALS+DONG, F+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 1993::no title+ENGEL J+APPL STAT-J ROY ST C+1992::A REVIEW OF ROBUST PROCESS DESIGN APPROACHES+GRIZE, YL+JOURNAL OF CHEMOMETRICS+JUL-AUG 1995::no title+KUNERT J+MODA+1998::On the use of the factor-sparsity assumption to get an estimate of the variance in saturated designs+Kunert, J+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1997::Robust design via generalized linear models+Lee, Y; Nelder, JA+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2003::no title+LOGOTHETIS N+APPL STAT-J ROY ST C+1990::HOW TO ACHIEVE A ROBUST PROCESS USING RESPONSE-SURFACE METHODOLOGY+LUCAS, JM+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 1994::RESPONSE-SURFACE ALTERNATIVES TO THE TAGUCHI ROBUST PARAMETER DESIGN APPROACH+MYERS, RH; KHURI, AI; VINING, G+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1992::RESPONSE MODEL ANALYSIS FOR ROBUST DESIGN EXPERIMENTS+SHOEMAKER, AC; TSUI, KL+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+1993::ECONOMICAL EXPERIMENTATION METHODS FOR ROBUST DESIGN+SHOEMAKER, AC; TSUI, KL; WU, CFJ+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1991::DISPERSION EFFECTS IN ROBUST-DESIGN EXPERIMENTS WITH NOISE FACTORS+STEINBERG, DM; BURSZTYN, D+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 1994::Noise factors, dispersion effects, and robust design+Steinberg, DM; Bursztyn, D+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 1998::no title+Taguchi, G.; Wu, Y.+Introduction to Off-Line Quality Control+1985::Optimal selection of single arrays for parameter design experiments+Wu, CFJ; Zhu, Y+STATISTICA SINICA+OCT 2003"
Point and interval estimation for a simple step-stress model with type-II censoring,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2007,21,76,"In reliability and life-testing experiments, the researcher is often interested in the effects of extreme or varying stress levels, such as temperature, voltage, and load, on the lifetimes of experimental units. Accelerated testing allows the experimenter to increase these stress levels to obtain information on the parameters of the life distributions more quickly than would be possible under normal operating conditions. A special class of accelerated tests are step-stress tests that allow the experimenter to increase the stress levels at fixed times during the experiment. In this article, we consider the simple step-stress model under Type-II censoring. We derive the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) of the parameters assuming a cumulative exposure model with lifetimes being exponentially distributed. The exact distributions of the MLEs of parameters are obtained through the use of conditional moment-generating functions.

Optimal maintenance time for repairable systems,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2007,15,16,"A repairable system operates under a maintenance strategy that calls for complete preventive repair actions at prescheduled times and minimal repair actions whenever a failure occurs. Under minimal repair, failures are modeled according to a nonhomogeneous Poisson process. When the intensity function is assumed to grow proportional to a power of time, this process is called the power law process. Assuming that the system will be in operation for an infinite time, we find the expected cost per unit of time for each preventive maintenance policy and hence obtain the optimal strategy as a function of the intensity function of the process. Large-sample procedures to estimate the optimal maintenance check points for the power law process are also discussed. The results are applied in a real data set concerning failures histories of power transformers.","maximum likelihood estimate,minimal repair,nonhomogeneous Poisson process,power law process","PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE,REPLACEMENT","Gilardoni, Gustavo L.@Univ Brasilia, Dept Stat, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil@Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Stat, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil::Colosimo, Enrico A.@Univ Brasilia, Dept Stat, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil@Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Stat, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil","Gilardoni, Gustavo L.@Universidade de Brasilia@Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais::Colosimo, Enrico A.@Universidade de Brasilia@Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais","Gilardoni, Gustavo@J-2732-2015::Gilardoni, Gustavo@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7477-3610","no title+Ascher, H; Feingold, H.+Repairable systems reliability+1984::no title+Bain, L.

The rate of false signals in X control charts with estimated limits,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2007,23,27,"The in-control statistical properties of (X) over bar charts have usually been studied from the perspective of the average run length (ARL) until the first (false) signal, known as the in-control ARL. We argue that the ARL is a confusing concept when used with charts with estimated limits and that the rate of false signals (RFS), which focuses on the behavior of charts during extended use, is more intuitive. We use the RFS to illustrate graphically the dangers of using too few subgroups to estimate control limits. We also discuss diffidence charts, which make the inherent uncertainty concerning RFS observable to the practitioner and thus help the practitioner determine what is an acceptable number of subgroups for a given charting application.","average run length,control limits,diffidence,estimated parameters","STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,RUN-LENGTH DISTRIBUTION,ESTIMATED PARAMETERS,(X)OVER-BAR","Bischak, Diane P.@Univ Calgary, Haskayne Sch Business, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada@Amer Univ Armenia, Dept Ind Engn, Yerevan, Armenia::Trietsch, Dan@Univ Calgary, Haskayne Sch Business, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada@Amer Univ Armenia, Dept Ind Engn, Yerevan, Armenia","Bischak, Diane P.@University of Calgary@Unknow::Trietsch, Dan@University of Calgary@Unknow",not exist,"Estimation in Shewhart control charts: effects and corrections+Albers, W; Kallenberg, WCM+METRIKA+JUN 2004::Run length, average run length and false alarm rate of Shewhart X-bar chart: Exact derivations by conditioning+Chakraborti, S+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+2000::The mean and standard deviation of the run length distribution of (X)over-bar charts when control limits are estimated+Chen, GM+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 1997::A review of statistical process control techniques for short run manufacturing systems+DelCastillo, E; Grayson, JM; Montgomery, DC; et al.+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1996::SHEWHART XBAR-CHARTS WITH ESTIMATED PROCESS VARIANCE+GHOSH, BK; REYNOLDS, MR; VANHUI, Y+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS PART A-THEORY AND METHODS+1981::The changepoint model for statistical process control+Hawkins, DM; Qiu, PH; Kang, CW+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 2003::SELF-STARTING CUSUM CHARTS FOR LOCATION AND SCALE+HAWKINS, DM+STATISTICIAN+1987::X and R Chart Control Limits Based on a Small Number of Subgroups+Hiller, F.

Step-down analysis for changes in the covariance matrix and other parameters,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2007,28,21,"Step-down diagnostic analysis to infer which means have changed (after detection of a shift in the mean vector) is familiar in multivariate statistical process control. We show how to include in the diagnostic analysis the elements of the covariance matrix and other higher order moments and give practical examples. We use the asymptotic normality of maximum-likelihood estimators to classify the parameters that describe the prior- and post-shift distributions into those for which there is significant evidence of a shift and those for which such evidence is lacking. This diagnostic information can be useful in guiding the search for the cause(s) of the shift. For practical applications, the choice of parameterization may affect the ease of interpretation of the diagnostic results. It may be more informative to use standard deviations and correlation coefficients instead of variances and covariances, and this approach is illustrated in our analysis and examples. We also consider application to distributions other than the multivariate normal and give an example with a multivariate gamma distribution. Although illustrated with independent and identically distributed observations, the proposed methodology is more general.","diagnosis of shift,individual observations,multivariate gamma distribution,regime shift,retrospective analysis,statistical process control,structural change","MULTIVARIATE INDIVIDUAL OBSERVATIONS,CONTROL CHART,CHANGE-POINT,T-2,INSTABILITY,VARIANCE,TESTS","Sullivan, Joe H.@Mississippi State Univ, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA@Rutgers State Univ, Dept Management Sci & Informat Syst, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA@SW Res Inst, Inst Anal, San Antonio, TX 78228 USA@McNeese State Univ, Dept Math Comp Sci & Stat, Lake Charles, LA 70609 USA::Stoumbos, Zachary G.@Mississippi State Univ, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA@Rutgers State Univ, Dept Management Sci & Informat Syst, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA@SW Res Inst, Inst Anal, San Antonio, TX 78228 USA@McNeese State Univ, Dept Math Comp Sci & Stat, Lake Charles, LA 70609 USA::Mason, Robert L.@Mississippi State Univ, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA@Rutgers State Univ, Dept Management Sci & Informat Syst, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA@SW Res Inst, Inst Anal, San Antonio, TX 78228 USA@McNeese State Univ, Dept Math Comp Sci & Stat, Lake Charles, LA 70609 USA::Young, John C.@Mississippi State Univ, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA@Rutgers State Univ, Dept Management Sci & Informat Syst, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA@SW Res Inst, Inst Anal, San Antonio, TX 78228 USA@McNeese State Univ, Dept Math Comp Sci & Stat, Lake Charles, LA 70609 USA","Sullivan, Joe H.@Mississippi State University@Rutgers State University New Brunswick@Southwest Research Institute@McNeese State University@University of Louisiana System::Stoumbos, Zachary G.@Mississippi State University@Rutgers State University New Brunswick@Southwest Research Institute@McNeese State University@University of Louisiana System::Mason, Robert L.@Mississippi State University@Rutgers State University New Brunswick@Southwest Research Institute@McNeese State University@University of Louisiana System::Young, John C.@Mississippi State University@Rutgers State University New Brunswick@Southwest Research Institute@McNeese State University@University of Louisiana System",not exist,"TESTS FOR PARAMETER INSTABILITY AND STRUCTURAL-CHANGE WITH UNKNOWN CHANGE-POINT+ANDREWS, DWK+ECONOMETRICA+JUL 1993::ESTIMATION AND INFERENCE IN NONLINEAR STRUCTURAL MODELS+BERNDT, EK; HALL, BH; HALL, RE; et al.+ANNALS OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL MEASUREMENT+1974::THE ASYMPTOTIC COVARIANCE-MATRIX OF SAMPLE CORRELATION-COEFFICIENTS UNDER GENERAL CONDITIONS+BROWNE, MW; SHAPIRO, A+LINEAR ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS+OCT 1986::Improved monitoring of multivariate process variability+Djauhari, MA+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2005::Long-term global market correlations+Goetzmann, WN; Li, LF; Rouwenhorst, KG+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS+JAN 2005::no title+Greene, W.

Design of experiment algorithms for assembled products,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2006,20,5,"Designing experiments to identify improvement in products that are assembled from manufactured components does not readily fit into conventional design of experiments methods and can be costly. Efficient methods are explored for determining designs for engineering problems where some, or all, of the factors of interest are (a) not easily set to prescribed values and (b) are dependent on a combination of properties of several components. The methods involve taking a sample of each type of component, measuring the relevant features and then finding a design that specifies an optimal set of assembled products for experiment. Three examples from manufacturing industry are presented to illustrate the approach. Two different algorithms for finding designs are described, an exchange algorithm and a genetic algorithm, and a comparison of their performances is made on the three examples.","D-optimality,exchange algorithm,genetic algorithm,search","GENETIC ALGORITHM,CONSTRUCTION","Sexton, Christine J.@Off Natl Stat, Titchfield PO15 5RR, Fareham, England@Univ Southampton, Southampton Stat Sci Res Inst, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England@Univ Southampton, Sch Math, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England@Univ Southampton, Sch Engn Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England::Anthony, David K.@Off Natl Stat, Titchfield PO15 5RR, Fareham, England@Univ Southampton, Southampton Stat Sci Res Inst, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England@Univ Southampton, Sch Math, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England@Univ Southampton, Sch Engn Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England::Lewis, Susan M.@Off Natl Stat, Titchfield PO15 5RR, Fareham, England@Univ Southampton, Southampton Stat Sci Res Inst, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England@Univ Southampton, Sch Math, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England@Univ Southampton, Sch Engn Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England::Please, Colin P.@Off Natl Stat, Titchfield PO15 5RR, Fareham, England@Univ Southampton, Southampton Stat Sci Res Inst, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England@Univ Southampton, Sch Math, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England@Univ Southampton, Sch Engn Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England::Keane, Andy J.@Off Natl Stat, Titchfield PO15 5RR, Fareham, England@Univ Southampton, Southampton Stat Sci Res Inst, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England@Univ Southampton, Sch Math, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England@Univ Southampton, Sch Engn Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England","Sexton, Christine J.@Unknow@University of Southampton@University of Southampton@University of Southampton::Anthony, David K.@Unknow@University of Southampton@University of Southampton@University of Southampton::Lewis, Susan M.@Unknow@University of Southampton@University of Southampton@University of Southampton::Please, Colin P.@Unknow@University of Southampton@University of Southampton@University of Southampton::Keane, Andy J.@Unknow@University of Southampton@University of Southampton@University of Southampton","Anthony, David@L-9045-2014::Please, Colin@G-6247-2011::Keane, Andy@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7993-1569::Please, Colin@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8917-8574::ANTHONY, David K@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3140-5583","no title+ANTHONY DK+P INT C MAN INN MAN+2003::Genetic algorithms for design of experiments on assembled products+Anthony, DK; Keane, AJ.+University of Southampton School of Mathematics Technical Report No. 385+2004::Tolerancing mechanical assemblies with CAD and DOE+Bisgaard, S; Graves, S; Shin, G+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 2000::Designing experiments for tolerancing assembled products+Bisgaard, S+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 1997::A COMPARISON OF ALGORITHMS FOR CONSTRUCTING EXACT D-OPTIMAL DESIGNS+COOK, RD; NACHTSHEIM, CJ+TECHNOMETRICS+1980::no title+Cornell, J.A.+Experiments with mixtures: designs, models, and the analysis of mixture data+1990::A web-based knowledge elicitation system (GISEL) for planning and assessing group screening experiments for product development+Dupplaw, DP; Brunson, D; Vine, AJE; et al.+JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING+SEP 2004::THE APPLICATION OF THE ANNEALING ALGORITHM TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF EXACT OPTIMAL DESIGNS FOR LINEAR-REGRESSION MODELS+HAINES, LM+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1987::NEARLY OPTIMAL ALLOCATION OF EXPERIMENTAL UNITS USING OBSERVED COVARIATE VALUES+HARVILLE, DA+TECHNOMETRICS+1974::Genetic algorithms for the construction of D-optimal designs+Heredia-Langner, A; Carlyle, WM; Montgomery, DC; et al.+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2003::no title+HOLLAND J+ADAPTATION NATURAL A+1975::An adaptive real-coded genetic algorithm+Lee, LH; Fan, YL+APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE+JUL 2002::no title+Myers, R.

Efficient 2(k) factorial designs for blocks of size 2 with microarray applications,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2006,15,18,"When a two-level design must be run in blocks of size two, there is a unique blocking scheme that enables estimation of all the main effects. Unfortunately, this design does not enable estimation of any two-factor interactions. When the experimental goal is to estimate all main effects and two-factor interactions, it is necessary to combine replicates of the experiment that use different blocking schemes. In this paper, we identify such designs for k <= 8 factors that enable estimation of all main effects and two-factor interactions with the fewest number of replications. In addition, we give a construction for general k that gives more economical designs than previously published. Last, we consider issues particular to the design of two-color microarray experiments. For example, we propose a methodology to ensure dye balance in these experiments without increasing the number of replications.","block design,blocked factorial,factorial design,fractional factorial",,"Kerr, Kathleen F.@Univ Washington, Dept Biostat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Kerr, Kathleen F.@University of Washington@University of Washington Seattle","Kerr, Kathleen@A-2893-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6438-9583","Comparison of microarray designs for class comparison and class discovery+Dobbin, K; Simon, R+BIOINFORMATICS+NOV 2002::Two-level factorial and fractional factorial designs in blocks of size two+Draper, NR; Guttman, I+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 1997::no title+GE, P.; Hunter, J.S; Box, G.E.P.+Statistics for experimenters: an introduction to design, data analysis, and model building+1978::Factorial and time course designs for cDNA microarray experiments+Glonek, GFV; Solomon, PJ+BIOSTATISTICS+JAN 2004::Design considerations for efficient and effective microarray studies+Kerr, MK+BIOMETRICS+DEC 2003::Experimental design for gene expression microarrays+Kerr, MK; Churchill, GA.+Biostatistics+2001::Statistical design and the analysis of gene expression microarray data+Kerr, MK; Churchill, GA+GENETICAL RESEARCH+APR 2001::2-LEVEL FRACTIONAL FACTORIALS AND BAYESIAN PREDICTION+MITCHELL, TJ; MORRIS, MD; YLVISAKER, D+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 1995::DNA microarray experiments: Biological and technological aspects+Nguyen, DV; Arpat, AB; Wang, NY; et al.+BIOMETRICS+DEC 2002::Design and analysis of experiments with high throughput biological assay data+Rocke, DM+SEMINARS IN CELL &amp; DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY+DEC 2004::Fractional resolution and minimum aberration in blocked 2(n-k) designs+Sitter, RR; Chen, JH; Feder, M+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1997::Optimal blocking schemes for 2(n) and 2(n-p) designs+Sun, DX; Wu, CFJ; Chen, YY+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 1997::Designing two-level fractional factorial experiments in blocks of size two+Wang, P.

For constrained and unconstrained experimental regions, the resulting experimental designs are shown to be statistically much more efficient than the orthogonally blocked design options presented in the literature. As an alternative to the algorithmic approach, a simple two-stage procedure to construct highly efficient blocked mixture experiments for unconstrained design regions in the presence of fixed and/or random blocks is presented. Finally, the similarities and differences between the design of blocked mixture experiments and mixture experiments in the presence of qualitative process variables are discussed in detail.","fixed and random blocks,minimum-support design,mixture experiment,orthogonal blocking,process variables,qualitative variables","RESPONSE-SURFACE DESIGNS,ORTHOGONAL BLOCKS,MODELS","Goos, Peter@Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, Antwerp, Belgium@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Appl Econ, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium@Univ Sheffield, Dept Probabil & Stat, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England::Donev, Alexander N.@Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, Antwerp, Belgium@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Appl Econ, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium@Univ Sheffield, Dept Probabil & Stat, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England","Goos, Peter@University of Antwerp@KU Leuven@University of Sheffield::Donev, Alexander N.@University of Antwerp@KU Leuven@University of Sheffield","Donev, Alexander@C-6738-2009@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8809-1888","no title+Atkinson, A.C.; Donev, A.N.+Optimum Experimental Designs+1992::THE CONSTRUCTION OF EXACT D-OPTIMUM EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGNS WITH APPLICATION TO BLOCKING RESPONSE-SURFACE DESIGNS+ATKINSON, AC; DONEV, AN+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1989::Experimental designs optimally balanced for trend+Atkinson, AC; Donev, AN+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1996::MODELS FOR RESPONSE OF A MIXTURE+BECKER, NG+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1968::Experimental designs when there are one or more factor constraints+Box, G; Hau, I+JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS+NOV 2001::COMPUTER-AIDED BLOCKING OF FACTORIAL AND RESPONSE-SURFACE DESIGNS+COOK, RD; NACHTSHEIM, CJ+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 1989::no title+Cornell, J.

Analytical global sensitivity analysis and uncertainty propagation for robust design,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2006,30,10,"Simulation-based robust design is playing an increasingly important role in industrial practice where design analyses involve extensive computer simulations. In simulation-based robust design, metamodels, also called response surface models, are often created to replace computationally expensive, high-fidelity, and black-box type of simulation programs. Interpretation of metamodels for the purpose of robust design becomes important. The computational expenses associated with certain types of metamodels and the random errors introduced by the data-sampling approach require the development of analytical methods, such as those for global sensitivity analysis (GSA) and uncertainty propagation (UP) to facilitate a robust-design process. In this work, generalized analytical formulations are developed for GSA and UP in robust design via the use of a variety of metamodels commonly used in engineering design applications. We show that even though the function forms of these metamodels vary significantly, they all follow the form of multivariate tensor-product basis functions for which the analytical results can be derived based on decomposed univariate integrals. The benefits of our proposed techniques are demonstrated using the robust engine piston design as an example. Even though our discussion is oriented toward simulation-based robust design, the same approach can be applied to quality engineering applications where metamodels are constructed based on physical experiments.","analytical formulation,global sensitivity analysis,metamodeling,response surface modeling,robust design,tensor basis product function,uncertainty propagation","COMPUTER-MODELS,SYSTEMS","Chen, Wei@Northwestern Univ, Dept Mech Engn, IDEAL, Evanston, IL 60208 USA@Ford Motor Co, Dearborn, MI 48121 USA@Bank Amer, Corp Ctr, Charlotte, NC 28255 USA::Jin, Ruichen@Northwestern Univ, Dept Mech Engn, IDEAL, Evanston, IL 60208 USA@Ford Motor Co, Dearborn, MI 48121 USA@Bank Amer, Corp Ctr, Charlotte, NC 28255 USA::Sudjianto, Agus@Northwestern Univ, Dept Mech Engn, IDEAL, Evanston, IL 60208 USA@Ford Motor Co, Dearborn, MI 48121 USA@Bank Amer, Corp Ctr, Charlotte, NC 28255 USA","Chen, Wei@Northwestern University@Ford Motor Company@Bank of America Corporation::Jin, Ruichen@Northwestern University@Ford Motor Company@Bank of America Corporation::Sudjianto, Agus@Northwestern University@Ford Motor Company@Bank of America Corporation","Chen, Wei@B-7574-2009","no title+Box, G.

Effects of parameter estimation on control chart properties: A literature review,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2006,83,271,"Control charts are powerful tools used to monitor the quality of processes. In practice, control chart limits are often calculated using parameter estimates from an in-control Phase I reference sample. In Phase II of the monitoring scheme, statistics based on new samples are compared with the estimated control limits to monitor for departures from the in-control state. Many studies that evaluate control chart performance in Phase II rely on the assumption that the in-control parameters are known. Although the additional variability introduced into the monitoring scheme through parameter estimation is known to affect the chart performance, many studies do not consider the effect of estimation on the performance of the chart. This paper contains a review of the literature that explicitly considers the effect of parameter estimation on control chart properties. Some recommendations are made and future research ideas in this area are provided.","ARL,conditional distribution,marginal distribution,phase I,phase II,run-length performance,sample size,Shewhart chart,statistical process control","STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,RUN-LENGTH DISTRIBUTIONS,MULTIVARIATE CONTROL CHARTS,SHEWHART CONTROL CHARTS,EWMA CONTROL CHARTS,(X)OVER-BAR CHARTS,CONTROL LIMITS,SAMPLE-SIZE,TIME-SERIES,AUTOCORRELATED PROCESSES","Jensen, Willis A.@WL Gore & Assoc Inc, Med Prod Div, Flagstaff, AZ 86003 USA@Auburn Univ, Dept Management, Auburn, AL 36849 USA@Georgia So Univ, Dept Math Sci, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Jones-Farmer, L.

Design of cumulative sum schemes for start-up processes and short runs,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2006,24,13,"A cumulative sum (CUSUM) of Q statistics was previously proposed for detecting shifts in the process mean when the parameters of the process distribution are unknown, such as in start-up processes and short runs. This CUSUM scheme is modeled on the classic CUSUM procedure for detecting a shift in the mean of a normally distributed process. The design constants derived to give the classic CUSUM optimal performance in detecting a shift of a given magnitude, however, are not optimal for detecting the same shift with the CUSUM of Q statistics, because the derivation of these design constants does not account for the distribution of the Q statistics following a shift. The extent of the suboptimality is greater the earlier the shift occurs. In this article, improved design constants for the CUSUM of Q statistics are obtained by using a search procedure in conjunction with Monte Carlo simulation.","Q chart,run-length distribution,self-starting method,statistical process control","CONTROL CHARTS,ESTIMATED PARAMETERS,MODEL,DISTRIBUTIONS,PERFORMANCE","Zantek, Paul F.@Univ Maryland, Robert H Smith Sch Business, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Zantek, Paul F.@University System of Maryland@University of Maryland College Park","Zantek, Paul@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8171-1901","Design of exponentially weighted moving average control charts for autocorrelated processes with model uncertainty+Apley, DW; Lee, HC+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 2003::UNTITLED - DISCUSSION+DELCASTILLO, E+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 1995::UNTITLED - DISCUSSION+FARNUM, NR+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 1995::no title+Hawkins, D.

Phase I analysis for monitoring nonlinear profiles in manufacturing processes,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2006,30,123,"Phase I analysis of nonlinear profiles aims at identifying the data from an in-control process as accurately as possible so that quality engineers can have a good reference to establish the control charts for a future process. Unlike linear profiles, which can be represented by a linear regression model with its model parameters used for monitoring and detection, nonlinear profiles are often sampled into high-dimensional data vectors and analyzed by nonparametric methods. Meanwhile, automatic in-process data-collection devices generate huge historical data sets, which must be analyzed for the presence of observations from out-of-control process conditions. The high dimensionality and data contamination present a challenge to the Phase I analysis of nonlinear profiles. This paper presents a strategy that consists of two major components: a data-reduction component that projects the original data into a lower dimension subspace while preserving the data-clustering structure and a data-separation technique that can detect single and multiple shifts as well as outliers in the data. Simulated data sets as well as nonlinear profile signals from a forging process are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.","change-point detection,clustering,control chart,multivariate analysis","MULTIPLE-FAULT DETECTION,PROJECTION PURSUIT,HAAR-TRANSFORM","Ding, Yu@Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA@Univ Wisconsin, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA::Zeng, Li@Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA@Univ Wisconsin, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA::Zhou, Shiyu@Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA@Univ Wisconsin, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Ding, Yu@Texas A&M University System@Texas A&M University College Station@University of Wisconsin System@University of Wisconsin Madison::Zeng, Li@Texas A&M University System@Texas A&M University College Station@University of Wisconsin System@University of Wisconsin Madison::Zhou, Shiyu@Texas A&M University System@Texas A&M University College Station@University of Wisconsin System@University of Wisconsin Madison",not exist,"A factor-analysis method for diagnosing variability in multivariate manufacturing processes+Apley, DW; Shi, JJ+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 2001::Multiscale PCA with application to multivariate statistical process monitoring+Bakshi, BR+AICHE JOURNAL+JUL 1998::no title+BARNETT K+J MAT MANUFACTURING+1998::no title+CARREIRAPERPINA.M+CS9609 U SHEFF DEP C+1997::Model-based clustering, discriminant analysis, and density estimation+Fraley, C; Raftery, AE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2002::no title+Gelman, A.; Carlin, J.

Distribution of Hotelling's T-2 statistic based on the successive differences estimator,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2006,22,47,"In the historical (or retrospective or Phase I) multivariate data analysis, the choice of the estimator for the variance-covariance matrix is crucial to successfully detecting the presence of special causes of variation. For the case of individual multivariate observations, the choice is compounded by the lack of rational subgroups of observations with the same distribution. Other research has shown that the use of the sample covariance matrix, with all of the individual observations pooled, impairs the detection of a sustained step shift in the mean vector. For example, research has shown that, with the use of the sample covariance matrix, the probability of a signal actually decreases below the false-alarm probability with a sustained step shift near the middle of the data and that the signal probability decreases with the size of the shift. An alternative estimator, based on the successive differences of the individual observations, leads to an increasing signal probability as the size of the step shift increases and has been recommended for use in Phase I analysis. However, the exact distribution for the resulting T-2 chart statistics has not been determined when the successive differences estimator is used. Three approximate distributions have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we demonstrate several useful properties of the T-2 statistics based on the successive differences estimator and give a more accurate approximate distribution for calculating the upper control limit for individual observations in a Phase I analysis.","approximate distribution,false alarm rate,multivariate SPC,sample size,T-2 control chart","MULTIVARIATE CONTROL CHARTS,INDIVIDUAL OBSERVATIONS","Williams, James D.@GE Global Res, Appl Stat Lab, Niskayuna, NY 12309 USA@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA@Mississippi State Univ, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA::Woodall, William H.@GE Global Res, Appl Stat Lab, Niskayuna, NY 12309 USA@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA@Mississippi State Univ, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA::Birch, Jeffrey B.@GE Global Res, Appl Stat Lab, Niskayuna, NY 12309 USA@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA@Mississippi State Univ, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA::Sullivan, Joe H.@GE Global Res, Appl Stat Lab, Niskayuna, NY 12309 USA@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA@Mississippi State Univ, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA","Williams, James D.@General Electric@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University@Mississippi State University::Woodall, William H.@General Electric@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University@Mississippi State University::Birch, Jeffrey B.@General Electric@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University@Mississippi State University::Sullivan, Joe H.@General Electric@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University@Mississippi State University","Woodall, William@A-8094-2009","Power comparisons for a Hotelling's T-2 statistic+Chou, YM; Mason, RL; Young, JC+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+1999::no title+CHOU YM+COMMUNICATIONS STA A+2001::no title+Fuchs, C.; Kenett, R.+Multivariate Quality Control with Industrial Applications+1998::ROBUST ESTIMATES, RESIDUALS, AND OUTLIER DETECTION WITH MULTIRESPONSE DATA+GNANADESIKAN, R; KETTENRING, JR+BIOMETRICS+1972::DETECTION OF ERRORS IN MULTIVARIATE DATA USING PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS+HAWKINS, DM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1974::Zonation of multivariate sequences of digitized geologic data+Hawkins, DM; Merriam, DF.+Mathematical Geology+1974::no title+HOLMES DS+QUAL ENG+1993::A REVIEW OF MULTIVARIATE CONTROL CHARTS+LOWRY, CA; MONTGOMERY, DC+IIE TRANSACTIONS+DEC 1995::Phase I analysis of linear profiles with calibration applications+Mahmoud, M.

Multivariate control charts for monitoring the mean vector and covariance matrix,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2006,40,48,"Multivariate control charts are considered for the simultaneous monitoring of the mean vector and covariance matrix when the joint distribution of process variables is multivariate normal. Emphasis is on the use of combinations of multivariate exponentially weighted moving average (MEWMA) control charts based on sample means and on the sum of the squared deviations from target. The performance of these combinations is compared with the performance of standard multivariate Shewhart charts and to combinations of univariate EWMA charts applied to each of the variables. The performance of these control charts with and without the use of Hawkins' (1991) method of regression adjustment of the variables is investigated. The performance of many of the control charts depends on the direction of the shift in the mean vector or covariance matrix, so performance is investigated for specific shift directions and also for averages over all directions. The best overall performance is achieved using a combination of MEWMA charts based on the sample means and on the sum of squared regression adjusted deviations from target.","multivariate exponentially weighted moving average control chart,regression adjustment of variables,Shewhart chart,squared deviations from target,statistical process control,steady-state average time to signal","WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE,EWMA CONTROL CHART,SUM CONTROL CHARTS,FAST INITIAL RESPONSE,QUALITY-CONTROL,INTEGRAL-EQUATION,CONTROL SCHEMES,CONTROL LIMITS,RUN-LENGTH,VARIABILITY","Reynolds, Marion R., Jr.@Virginia Tech, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA@Virginia Tech, Dept Forestry, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA@Kyungpook Natl Univ, Dept Stat, Taegu 702701, South Korea::Cho, Gyo-Young@Virginia Tech, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA@Virginia Tech, Dept Forestry, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA@Kyungpook Natl Univ, Dept Stat, Taegu 702701, South Korea","Reynolds, Marion R., Jr.@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University@Kyungpook National University::Cho, Gyo-Young@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University@Kyungpook National University",not exist,"Multivariate quality control+Alt, FB.+The encyclopedia of statistical sciences+1984::Cumulative sum control charts for the covariance matrix+Chan, LK; Zhang, J+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 2001::MODELING AND ANALYSIS OF EWMA CONTROL SCHEMES WITH VARIANCE-ADJUSTED CONTROL LIMITS+CHANDRASEKARAN, S; ENGLISH, JR; DISNEY, RL+IIE TRANSACTIONS+JUN 1995::no title+CHO GY+THESIS VIRGINIA TECH+1991::MULTIVARIATE GENERALIZATIONS OF CUMULATIVE SUM QUALITY-CONTROL SCHEMES+CROSIER, RB+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 1988::SOME OMNIBUS EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE STATISTICAL PROCESS MONITORING SCHEMES+DOMANGUE, R; PATCH, SC+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 1991::REGRESSION ADJUSTMENT FOR VARIABLES IN MULTIVARIATE QUALITY-CONTROL+HAWKINS, DM+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1993::MULTIVARIATE QUALITY-CONTROL BASED ON REGRESSION-ADJUSTED VARIABLES+HAWKINS, DM+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1991::A NOTE ON MULTIVARIATE CUSUM PROCEDURES+HEALY, JD+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1987::Multivariate quality control+Hotelling, H.+Techniques of statistical analysis+1947::Multivariate monitoring using an MEWMA control chart with unequal sample sizes+Kim, K; Reynolds, MR+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 2005::Fast initial response features for EWMA control charts+Knoth, S+STATISTICAL PAPERS+JAN 2005::EWMA charts for multivariate time series+Kramer, H; Schmid, W.+Sequential Analysis+1997::A REVIEW OF MULTIVARIATE CONTROL CHARTS+LOWRY, CA; MONTGOMERY, DC+IIE TRANSACTIONS+DEC 1995::A MULTIVARIATE EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE CONTROL CHART+LOWRY, CA; WOODALL, WH; CHAMP, CW; et al.+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1992::ASASIAM series on statistics and applied mathematics+Mason, R.

Permutation methods for comparing process capabilities,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2006,21,10,"The statistical comparison of competing manufacturing processes is an important aspect of statistical quality control that aids quality managers in the choice of potential suppliers of products, manufacturing methodologies, or proposed adjustments to the manufacturing process. The selection criteria, in the absence of considerations such as cost, is based on a quality metric, such as the capability of each manufacturing process. Because quality metrics are estimated based on sample process data, the inherent variability in the estimates must be accounted for when selecting the best manufacturing process. In this paper, we consider solutions to this problem based on permutation testing methodology. In the case of two processes, the methodology is based on a simple permutation test of the null hypothesis that the two processes have equal capability. In the case of more than two processes, multiple-comparison techniques are used in conjunction with the proposed permutation tests. The advantage of using the permutation methods is that the significance levels of the permutation tests are exact regardless of the distribution of the process data. The methodology is demonstrated using several examples, and the potential performance of the methods are investigated empirically.","bonferroni,bootstrap,multiple comparisons,p-value,randomization",INDEXES,"Polansky, Alan M.@No Illinois Univ, Div Stat, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA","Polansky, Alan M.@Northern Illinois University",not exist,"A NEW MEASURE OF PROCESS CAPABILITY - CPM+CHAN, LK; CHENG, SW; SPIRING, FA+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1988::Comparing the capability of two processes using C-pm+Chen, JP; Chen, KS+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 2004::Selecting a better supplier by testing process capability indices+Chou, Y.

Blocked fractional factorial split-plot experiments for robust parameter design,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2006,28,9,"Fractional factorial experiments are commonly used for robust parameter design and, for ease of use, such experiments are often run as split-plot designs. If the control factors are at the subplot level and the noise factors are at the whole-plot level, this also results in gains in efficiency. If all runs of the fractional factorial split-plot design cannot be run under homogeneous conditions, such designs are frequently blocked. In this paper, we explore the choice of blocked fractional factorial split-plot designs for use in robust parameter design. A ranking scheme for such designs is developed and, using a search algorithm, a catalog of 32-run optimal designs is provided. Two situations are considered, one in which the control factors are at the subplot level and one in which the control factors are at the whole-plot level.

Bayesian tolerance intervals for the unbalanced one-way random effects model,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2006,25,4,"Statistical intervals, properly calculated from sample data, are likely to be substantially more informative to decision makers than obtaining a point estimate alone and are often of paramount interest to practitioners and thus management (and are usually a great deal more meaningful than statistical significance or hypothesis tests). In this note, a simulation-based approach for determining Bayesian tolerance intervals in an unbalanced one-way random effects model is illustrated. Reference and probability matching priors are first derived for a more general mixed linear model from which the priors for beta, sigma(2)(epsilon), and nu in the case of the random effects model follow easily, where beta is the grand mean, sigma(2)(epsilon) is the variance of random errors, and nu = sigma(2)(gamma)/sigma(2)(epsilon) is the ratio of the random effect to noise variances. A tensile-strength example illustrates the flexibility and unique features of the Bayesian simulation method for the construction of tolerance intervals. Although this example has only one random effect, the method can be applied similarly to other unbalanced data sets and models with multiple variance components. In the last section, a procedure is discussed to obtain Bayesian tolerance intervals for the three-component balanced hierarchical design model.","Bayesian procedure,Monte Carlo simulation,predictive density,probability matching prior,random effects,reference prior,tolerance intervals","VARIANCE COMPONENT MODELS,POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTIONS,PRIORS","van der Merwe, Abraham J.@Univ Orange Free State, Dept Math Sci, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa@Univ Orange Free State, Dept Math, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa::Pretorius, Albertus L.@Univ Orange Free State, Dept Math Sci, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa@Univ Orange Free State, Dept Math, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa::Meyer, Johannes H.@Univ Orange Free State, Dept Math Sci, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa@Univ Orange Free State, Dept Math, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa","van der Merwe, Abraham J.@University of the Free State@University of the Free State::Pretorius, Albertus L.@University of the Free State@University of the Free State::Meyer, Johannes H.@University of the Free State@University of the Free State",not exist,"EXPECTED-COVER AND LINEAR-UTILITY TOLERANCE INTERVALS+AITCHISON, J+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1966::BAYESIAN TOLERANCE REGIONS+AITCHISON, J+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1964::no title+Aitchison, J.; Dunsmore, I.

The use of control charts in health-care and public-health surveillance,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2006,146,224,There are many applications of control charts in health-care monitoring and in public-health surveillance. We introduce these applications to industrial practitioners and discuss some of the ideas that arise that may be applicable in industrial monitoring. The advantages and disadvantages of the charting methods proposed in the health-care and public-health areas are considered. Some additional contributions in the industrial statistical process control literature relevant to this area are given. There are many application and research opportunities available in the use of control charts for health-related monitoring.,"cluster detection,cumulative sum chart,CUSUM,exponentially weighted moving average,risk-adjustment,sequential probability ratio test,sets method,SPC,statistical process control","AVERAGE CONTROL SCHEMES,MULTIVARIATE QUALITY-CONTROL,ABERRATION DETECTION METHODS,STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,PROBABILITY RATIO TESTS,SUM CONTROL CHARTS,DISEASE SURVEILLANCE,MONITORING-SYSTEM,INFECTION-CONTROL,CARDIAC-SURGERY","Woodall, WH@Virginia Tech, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Woodall, WH@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University","Woodall, William@A-8094-2009","Performance league tables: the NHS deserves better+Adab, P; Rouse, AM; Mohammed, MA; et al.+BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL+JAN 12 2002::The use (and misuse) of false alarms probabilities in control chart design+Adams, B.

A Markov chain model for the adaptive CUSUM control chart,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2006,27,66,"In practice, when the magnitude of a future mean shift is unknown, it is always desired to design a control chart to perform reasonably well over a range of shifts rather than to optimize the performance at detecting a particular level of shifts. Compared with the conventional cumulative sum (CUSUM) control chart designed based on a prespecified mean shift, the adaptive CUSUM (ACUSUM) chart proposed by Sparks (2000) can detect a broader range of mean shifts. This paper develops a two-dimensional Markov chain model to analyze the performance of ACUSUM charts. Moreover, a more general operating model is suggested for the current ACUSUM chart to simplify its implementation.","average run length,EWMA,statistical process control","WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE,QUALITY-CONTROL SCHEMES,RUN LENGTHS","Shu, LJ@Univ Macau, Fac Business Adm, Macao, Peoples R China@Stevens Inst Technol, Dept Syst Engn & Engn Management, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA::Jiang, W@Univ Macau, Fac Business Adm, Macao, Peoples R China@Stevens Inst Technol, Dept Syst Engn & Engn Management, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA","Shu, LJ@University of Macau@Stevens Institute of Technology::Jiang, W@University of Macau@Stevens Institute of Technology","Shu, Lianjie@B-7911-2016","APPROACH TO PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION OF CUSUM RUN LENGTH+BROOK, D; EVANS, DA+BIOMETRIKA+1972::An adaptive exponentially weighted moving average control chart+Capizzi, G; Masarotto, G+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 2003::A NEW 2-SIDED CUMULATIVE SUM QUALITY-CONTROL SCHEME+CROSIER, RB+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 1986::no title+HAWKINS DM+J QUAL TECHNOL+1992::A FAST ACCURATE APPROXIMATION FOR AVERAGE RUN LENGTHS OF CUSUM CONTROL CHARTS+HAWKINS, DM+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 1992::THE EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE+HUNTER, JS+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 1986::Average run length computation of ARMA charts for stationary processes+Jiang, W+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+2001::A new SPC monitoring method: The ARMA chart+Jiang, W; Tsui, KL; Woodall, WH+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 2000::Sequential analysis: Some classical problems and new challenges+Lai, TL+STATISTICA SINICA+APR 2001::PROCEDURES FOR REACTING TO A CHANGE IN DISTRIBUTION+LORDEN, G+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1971::EWMA control charts for monitoring the mean of autocorrelated processes+Lu, CW; Reynolds, MR+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 1999::COMBINED SHEWHART-CUSUM QUALITY-CONTROL SCHEMES+LUCAS, JM+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+1982::EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE CONTROL SCHEMES - PROPERTIES AND ENHANCEMENTS+LUCAS, JM; SACCUCCI, MS+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1990::FAST INITIAL RESPONSE FOR CUSUM QUALITY-CONTROL SCHEMES - GIVE YOUR CUSUM A HEAD-START+LUCAS, JM; CROSIER, RB+TECHNOMETRICS+1982::no title+Montgomery, D.

A class of nearly orthogonal arrays,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2006,11,4,"Orthogonal arrays with mixed levels are very useful in factorial experiments when factors with different numbers of levels are to be investigated. However, one limitation associated with mixed-level orthogonal arrays is that many of them require a large number of runs. In such cases, nearly orthogonal arrays which generally use fewer runs by slightly relaxing the requirement of orthogonality-may be useful. We propose a definition of nearly orthogonal arrays of strength m, extending the concept of orthogonal arrays of strength m. We focus on the nearly orthogonal arrays involving 2- and 3-level factors with small run sizes. Some useful arrays are tabulated for practical use. These designs are shown to have nice statistical and combinatorial properties.","nearly orthogonal array of strength m,orthogonal array,strength","MIXED LEVELS,SMALL RUNS,CONSTRUCTION,DESIGNS","Lu, X@Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Math Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China@Univ Minnesota, Operat & Management Sci Dept, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA::Li, W@Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Math Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China@Univ Minnesota, Operat & Management Sci Dept, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA::Xie, M@Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Math Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China@Univ Minnesota, Operat & Management Sci Dept, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Lu, X@Tsinghua University@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities::Li, W@Tsinghua University@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities::Xie, M@Tsinghua University@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities",not exist,"Projective properties of certain orthogonal arrays+Box, G; Tyssedal, J+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1996::no title+Hedayat, A.

Practical inference from industrial split-plot designs,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2006,19,31,"In many industrial response surface experiments, some of the factors investigated are not reset independently. The resulting experimental design then is of the split-plot type, and the observations in the experiment are in many cases correlated. A proper analysis of the experimental data therefore is a mixed model analysis involving generalized least-squares estimation. Many people, however, analyze the data as if the experiment was completely randomized and estimate the model using ordinary least squares. The purposes of this article are to quantify the differences in conclusions reached from the two methods of analysis and to provide the reader with guidance for analyzing split-plot experiments in practice. The problem of determining the denominator degrees of freedom for significance tests in the mixed model analysis is discussed as well.","containment method,generalized least squares,method of Kenward and Roger,ordinary least squares,residual method,Satterthwaite's method","FACTORIAL-EXPERIMENTS,RANDOMIZATION,RESTRICTIONS","Goos, P@Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, Antwerp, Belgium@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Res Ctr Operat Res & Business Stat, Louvain, Belgium@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Univ Ctr Stat, Louvain, Belgium@CQ Consultancy, Louvain, Belgium::Langhans, I@Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, Antwerp, Belgium@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Res Ctr Operat Res & Business Stat, Louvain, Belgium@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Univ Ctr Stat, Louvain, Belgium@CQ Consultancy, Louvain, Belgium::Vandebroek, M@Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, Antwerp, Belgium@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Res Ctr Operat Res & Business Stat, Louvain, Belgium@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Univ Ctr Stat, Louvain, Belgium@CQ Consultancy, Louvain, Belgium","Goos, P@University of Antwerp@KU Leuven@KU Leuven@Unknow::Langhans, I@University of Antwerp@KU Leuven@KU Leuven@Unknow::Vandebroek, M@University of Antwerp@KU Leuven@KU Leuven@Unknow","Vandebroek, Martina@J-9103-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0317-1986","The design and analysis of 2(k-p) x 2(q-r) split plot experiments+Bisgaard, S+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2000::The design and analysis of 2(k-p)xs prototype experiments+Bisgaard, S; Steinberg, DM+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1997::Split-plot designs for robust product experimentation+Box, G.

A Bayesian approach for the determination of warranty length,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2006,36,5,"The purpose of many reliability studies is to decide the warranty length. However, a review of the classic literature on reliability reflects that it is a common practice to only recommend the use of low quantiles of the estimated distribution of time to failure. We propose a methodology that takes into account the following aspects: the reliability of the product, the consumer appreciation of the competitiveness of the warranty scheme, the effect on the image of the company when the product fails under the warranty period, and the costs that the manufacturer incurs to fulfill the warranty. The approach is based on the formulation of a utility function. Regarding the data structure, we contemplate complete sampling or censorship: type 1, II, and random. We illustrate the methodology with the determination of warranty length of brake linings.","dissatisfaction cost function,economic benefit function,expected utility function,posterior","DISTRIBUTIONS,CLAIMS,MODEL,COST","Gutierrez-Pulido, H@Univ Guadalajara, Ctr Exact Sci & Engn, Guadalajara 45050, Jalisco, Mexico@Inst Tecnol Autonoma Mexico, Dept Stat, Mexico City 01000, DF, Mexico@Ctr Invest Matemat, Dept Probabil & Stat, Guanjuato 36000, Guanajuato, Mexico::Aguirre-Torres, V@Univ Guadalajara, Ctr Exact Sci & Engn, Guadalajara 45050, Jalisco, Mexico@Inst Tecnol Autonoma Mexico, Dept Stat, Mexico City 01000, DF, Mexico@Ctr Invest Matemat, Dept Probabil & Stat, Guanjuato 36000, Guanajuato, Mexico::Christen, JA@Univ Guadalajara, Ctr Exact Sci & Engn, Guadalajara 45050, Jalisco, Mexico@Inst Tecnol Autonoma Mexico, Dept Stat, Mexico City 01000, DF, Mexico@Ctr Invest Matemat, Dept Probabil & Stat, Guanjuato 36000, Guanajuato, Mexico","Gutierrez-Pulido, H@Universidad de Guadalajara@Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico@Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico@Unknow::Aguirre-Torres, V@Universidad de Guadalajara@Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico@Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico@Unknow::Christen, JA@Universidad de Guadalajara@Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico@Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico@Unknow","Christen, J Andres@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5795-4345","Lean: A supplier's weapon against warranty costs+Allen, R.

Reliability-growth analysis of locomotive electrical equipment,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2006,13,1,"This paper presents a stochastic model developed to describe the reliability-growth of advanced technological systems during a planned on-service period, at the end of which the supplier has to demonstrate the conformity of system reliability to the contractual target. Purchase contracts of such systems generally regard a fleet of units (e.g., a fleet of new traction units for railway or subway service, airplanes, buses,...) so that the development programs are carried out on several system's copies, often put on service in batches during the development program. Thus, heterogeneity over units' reliability often arises, as a consequence of different scheduling of the improving activities. Hence, a stochastic reliability-growth model able to reveal heterogeneity was developed. This model was applied to the electrical equipment of a fleet of locomotives built by Ansaldo Breda for the Italian railway transport company. A graphical goodness-of-fit method shows the adequacy of the model to describe the observed reliability-growth process of a single locomotive. Again, a testing procedure was developed in order to reveal possible heterogeneity over the locomotives of the whole fleet and, hence, on the basis of the revealed heterogeneity, a mixed Poisson reliability-growth (MPRG) model was proposed to describe the reliability-growth process of a randomly selected locomotive of the fleet. Then, the probability of demonstrating the observance of the contractual obligations at the end of the development period was predicted on the basis of the failure data collected during the whole development program. Moreover, a procedure was proposed to test, before the development program is terminated, whether the planned remaining time is sufficiently long to assure a high probability of demonstrating the attainment of the reliability target at the end of the program.","locomotive electrical equipment,mixed Poisson reliability-growth model,reliability demonstration test",INFERENCE,"Giorgio, M@Univ Naples 2, Dept Aerosp & Mech Engn, Aversa, CE, Italy@Univ Salerno, Dept Informat Engn & Elect Engn, Fisciano, SA, Italy@Natl Res Council Italy, Ist Motori, Naples, Italy::Guida, M@Univ Naples 2, Dept Aerosp & Mech Engn, Aversa, CE, Italy@Univ Salerno, Dept Informat Engn & Elect Engn, Fisciano, SA, Italy@Natl Res Council Italy, Ist Motori, Naples, Italy::Pulcini, G@Univ Naples 2, Dept Aerosp & Mech Engn, Aversa, CE, Italy@Univ Salerno, Dept Informat Engn & Elect Engn, Fisciano, SA, Italy@Natl Res Council Italy, Ist Motori, Naples, Italy","Giorgio, M@Seconda Universita degli Studi di Napoli@University of Salerno@Istituto Motori (IM-CNR)@Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR)::Guida, M@Seconda Universita degli Studi di Napoli@University of Salerno@Istituto Motori (IM-CNR)@Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR)::Pulcini, G@Seconda Universita degli Studi di Napoli@University of Salerno@Istituto Motori (IM-CNR)@Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR)","Pulcini, Gianpaolo@H-2886-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5474-7095::GUIDA, Maurizio@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2245-7365","Exploring reliability data+Bendell, A.; Walls, A.+Quality &amp; Reliability Engineering International+1985::Statistical inference for a modulated power law process+Black, SE; Rigdon, SE+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 1996::no title+Cox, D.

Improved design of proportional integral derivative charts,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2006,25,10,"Jiang et al. (2002) introduced proportional integral derivative (PID) control charts for monitoring autocorrelated processes based on PID predictors and corresponding residuals. The major contribution of the PID chart is to bridge between engineering process control (EPC) techniques and statistical process control (SPC) schemes. Although the performance of PID charts has been reported in the literature, we focus on several design issues of this control scheme. In this paper, we consider the PID charting parameter design, the mean-shift pattern analysis, and the relationship between the average run-length (ARL) performance and PID parameter selection. Improved design schemes are suggested for different scenarios of autocorrelated processes and verified with Monte Carlo simulation.","average run length,control charts,mean-shift pattern,proportional integral derivative control","AUTOCORRELATED PROCESSES,CONTROL SCHEMES,T-2 CHART,SPC","Tsung, FG@Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Logist Management, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China@Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mkt, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China@Stevens Inst Technol, Dept Syst Engn & Engn Management, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA::Zhao, Y@Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Logist Management, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China@Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mkt, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China@Stevens Inst Technol, Dept Syst Engn & Engn Management, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA::Xiang, LM@Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Logist Management, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China@Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mkt, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China@Stevens Inst Technol, Dept Syst Engn & Engn Management, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA::Jiang, W@Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Logist Management, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China@Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mkt, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China@Stevens Inst Technol, Dept Syst Engn & Engn Management, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA","Tsung, FG@Hong Kong University of Science & Technology@Hong Kong University of Science & Technology@Stevens Institute of Technology::Zhao, Y@Hong Kong University of Science & Technology@Hong Kong University of Science & Technology@Stevens Institute of Technology::Xiang, LM@Hong Kong University of Science & Technology@Hong Kong University of Science & Technology@Stevens Institute of Technology::Jiang, W@Hong Kong University of Science & Technology@Hong Kong University of Science & Technology@Stevens Institute of Technology",not exist,"no title+ALEXOPOULOS C+FRONTIERS STAT QUALI+2004::The autoregressive T-2 chart for monitoring univariate autocorrelated processes+Apley, DW; Tsung, F+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2002::STATISTICAL PROCESS MONITORING AND FEEDBACK ADJUSTMENT - A DISCUSSION+BOX, G; KRAMER, T+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 1992::no title+BOX G+TIME SERIES ANAL+1994::Discrete proportional-integral control with constrained adjustment+Box, GEP; Luceno, A+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES D-THE STATISTICIAN+1995::no title+Box, GEP; Luceno, A.+Statistical Control by Monitoring and Feedback Adjustment+1997::Autocorrelated SPC for non-normal situations+Castagliola, P; Tsung, F+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+MAR 2005::STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL PROCEDURES FOR CORRELATED OBSERVATIONS+HARRIS, TJ; ROSS, WH+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING+FEB 1991::Some properties of the ARMA control chart+Jiang, W; Tsui, KL+NONLINEAR ANALYSIS-THEORY METHODS &amp; APPLICATIONS+AUG 2001::Proportional integral derivative charts for process monitoring+Jiang, W; Wu, HQ; Tsung, FG; et al.+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 2002::no title+JIANG W+TECHNOMETRICS+2000::EWMA control charts for monitoring the mean of autocorrelated processes+Lu, CW; Reynolds, MR+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 1999::EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE CONTROL SCHEMES - PROPERTIES AND ENHANCEMENTS+LUCAS, JM; SACCUCCI, MS+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1990::SOME STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL METHODS FOR AUTOCORRELATED DATA+MONTGOMERY, DC; MASTRANGELO, CM+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1991::MODEL-BASED AND MODEL-FREE CONTROL OF AUTOCORRELATED PROCESSES+RUNGER, GC; WILLEMAIN, TR+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 1995::Autocorrelated process monitoring using triggered Cuscore charts+Shu, LJ; Apley, DW; Tsung, F+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+SEP-OCT 2002::The dynamic T-2 chart for monitoring feedback-controlled processes+Tsung, F; Apley, DW+IIE TRANSACTIONS+DEC 2002::Integrated design of run-to-run PID controller and SPC monitoring for process disturbance rejection+Tsung, F; Shi, JJ+IIE TRANSACTIONS+JUN 1999::Joint monitoring of PID-controlled processes+Tsung, F; Shi, JJ; Wu, CFJ+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1999::On the efficiency and robustness of discrete proportional-integral control schemes+Tsung, F; Wu, HQ; Nair, VN+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 1998::A mean-shift pattern study on integration of SPC and APC for process monitoring+Tsung, FG; Tsui, KL+IIE TRANSACTIONS+MAR 2003::MODIFICATION OF CONTROL CHART LIMITS IN PRESENCE OF DATA CORRELATION+VASILOPOULOS, AV; STAMBOULIS, AP+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+1978::CONTROL CHARTS IN THE PRESENCE OF DATA CORRELATION+WARDELL, DG; MOSKOWITZ, H; PLANTE, RD+MANAGEMENT SCIENCE+AUG 1992::RUN-LENGTH DISTRIBUTIONS OF SPECIAL-CAUSE CONTROL CHARTS FOR CORRELATED PROCESSES+WARDELL, DG; MOSKOWITZ, H; PLANTE, RD+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1994::A statistical control chart for stationary process data+Zhang, NF+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1998"
A control scheme for high-yield correlated production under group inspection,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2006,17,11,"For some high-yield processes with very low defect parts-per-million (dppm), inspection is carried out in groups. Very often, within each group, the output characteristic is correlated. In this paper, we propose a control scheme that is effective in detecting changes in fraction nonconforming for high-yield processes with correlation within each inspection group. A Markov model is used to analyze the characteristics of the proposed scheme from which the average run length (ARL) and average time to signal (ATS) are obtained. The performance of the proposed scheme in terms of ATS is presented along with the comparison with the traditional cumulative conformance count (CCC) chart. Moreover, the effects of correlation and group size are also investigated. Finally, a numerical example and simulation studies are presented to reaffirm the performance of the proposed scheme in comparison with that of the conventional CCC chart.","correlation within sample,cumulative conformance count,high-volume production,sampling inspection",CONTROL CHART,"Tang, LC@Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Singapore 119260, Singapore::Cheong, WT@Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Singapore 119260, Singapore","Tang, LC@National University of Singapore::Cheong, WT@National University of Singapore",not exist,"QUALITY-CONTROL TECHNIQUES FOR ZERO DEFECTS+CALVIN, TW+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPONENTS HYBRIDS AND MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY+1983::Chain sampling inspection plan+Dodge, H.

Split-plot fractional designs: Is minimum aberration enough?,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2006,25,15,"Split-plot experiments are commonly used in industry for product and process improvement. Recent articles on designing split-plot experiments concentrate on minimum aberration as the design criterion. Minimum aberration has been criticized as a design criterion for completely randomized fractional factorial design and alternative criteria, such as the maximum number of clear two-factor interactions, are suggested (Wu and Hamada (2000)). The need for alternatives to minimum aberration is even more acute for split-plot designs. In a standard split-plot design, there are several types of two-factor interactions, not all of them equally interesting. However, minimum aberration is not designed to distinguish among the different types of two-factor interactions. It should be noted that this criticism is valid not only for the minimum aberration but also for any other design criteria originally proposed for completely randomized designs. Consequently, we provide a modified version of the maximum number of clear two-factor interactions design criterion to be used for split-plot designs.","design criterion,restriction on randomization,robust design,sequential processes",2-LEVEL,"Kulahci, M@Arizona State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA@WL Gore & Assoc Inc, Elkton, MD 21922 USA@SAS Inst Inc, Linear Models R&D, Cary, NC 27513 USA::Ramirez, JG@Arizona State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA@WL Gore & Assoc Inc, Elkton, MD 21922 USA@SAS Inst Inc, Linear Models R&D, Cary, NC 27513 USA::Tobias, R@Arizona State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA@WL Gore & Assoc Inc, Elkton, MD 21922 USA@SAS Inst Inc, Linear Models R&D, Cary, NC 27513 USA","Kulahci, M@Arizona State University@Unknow@Unknow::Ramirez, JG@Arizona State University@Unknow@Unknow::Tobias, R@Arizona State University@Unknow@Unknow","kulahci, murat@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4222-9631","SOME 2-LEVEL FACTORIAL PLANS WITH SPLIT PLOT CONFOUNDING+ADDELMAN, S+TECHNOMETRICS+1964::Discussion of complex experiments by F.

Robust parameter design using generalized linear mixed models,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2006,27,32,"In robust parameter design, it is often the case that the quality characteristic is nonnormal. An example in semiconductor manufacturing is resistivity, which typically follows a gamma distribution. It is also common to have models that contain, in addition to fixed polynomial effects, a random effect representing an extraneous source of variation. In this article, we demonstrate the use of generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) for situations in which the response is nonnormal and in which the noise variable is a random effect. We discuss the analysis of the random effects as well as the fixed effects in a fitted model using GLMM techniques. A numerical example from semiconductor manufacturing is provided for illustration.","noise variables,nonnormal,random effects,response surface methodology,robust design","RESPONSE-SURFACE MODELS,NONSTANDARD CONDITIONS","Robinson, TJ@Univ Wyoming, Dept Stat, Laramie, WY 82071 USA@Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA::Wulff, SS@Univ Wyoming, Dept Stat, Laramie, WY 82071 USA@Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA::Montgomery, DC@Univ Wyoming, Dept Stat, Laramie, WY 82071 USA@Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA::Khuri, AI@Univ Wyoming, Dept Stat, Laramie, WY 82071 USA@Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Robinson, TJ@University of Wyoming@Arizona State University@University of Florida@State University System of Florida::Wulff, SS@University of Wyoming@Arizona State University@University of Florida@State University System of Florida::Montgomery, DC@University of Wyoming@Arizona State University@University of Florida@State University System of Florida::Khuri, AI@University of Wyoming@Arizona State University@University of Florida@State University System of Florida",not exist,"APPROXIMATE INFERENCE IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS+BRESLOW, NE; CLAYTON, DG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::no title+BRINKLEY PA+APPL STAT-J ROY ST C+1996::no title+Brown, H.+Applied mixed models in medicine: statistics in practice+2001::The use of mixed logit models to reflect heterogeneity in capture-recapture studies+Coull, BA; Agresti, A+BIOMETRICS+MAR 1999::A generalized linear modeling approach to robust design+Engel, J; Huele, AF+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1996::Generalized linear models for quality-improvement experiments+Hamada, M; Nelder, JA+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1997::Response surface models with mixed effects+Khuri, AI+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 1996::RESPONSE-SURFACE MODELS WITH RANDOM BLOCK EFFECTS+KHURI, AI+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1992::Robust design via generalized linear models+Lee, Y; Nelder, JA+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2003::Hierarchical generalized linear models+Lee, Y; Nelder, JA+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1996::Analysis of count data from before-after control-impact studies+McDonald, TL; Erickson, WP; McDonald, LL+JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS+SEP 2000::no title+Myers, R.

Prediction variance properties of second-order designs for cuboidal regions,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2005,29,15,"Much information is available about the construction and evaluation of the prediction variance properties of response surface designs for fitting a second-order model in a spherical region of interest. There is less information; available about the prediction variance properties of second-order designs for a cuboidal region. In this paper, we construct and evaluate designs that are appropriate for the second-order model in cuboidal regions of interest. Several standard experimental designs are investigated and some new designs created using the G and / optimality criteria. We evaluate the designs using the variance of the predicted response over the design region. Variance dispersion graphs and fraction of design space plots are utilized to characterize the scaled prediction variance properties of the most promising designs.","cuboidal regions,genetic algorithm,prediction variance,response surface methodology,scaled prediction variance","RESPONSE-SURFACE DESIGNS,SECOND-ORDER DESIGNS,GENETIC ALGORITHMS,FACTORIAL DESIGNS,NOISE VARIABLES,3N FACTORIAL,CONSTRUCTION,FRACTIONS,CAPABILITY,MIXTURE","Park, YJ@Samsung Elect, Engn Informat Grp, Hwasung 445701, Kyeungkee, South Korea@Arizona State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA@Wyeth Pharmaceut, Biostat Grp, Pearl River, NY 10965 USA@Arizona State Univ W, Dept Math & Appl Comp, Glendale, AZ 85306 USA@Los Alamos Natl Lab, Stat Sci Grp, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA::Richardson, DE@Samsung Elect, Engn Informat Grp, Hwasung 445701, Kyeungkee, South Korea@Arizona State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA@Wyeth Pharmaceut, Biostat Grp, Pearl River, NY 10965 USA@Arizona State Univ W, Dept Math & Appl Comp, Glendale, AZ 85306 USA@Los Alamos Natl Lab, Stat Sci Grp, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA::Montgomery, DC@Samsung Elect, Engn Informat Grp, Hwasung 445701, Kyeungkee, South Korea@Arizona State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA@Wyeth Pharmaceut, Biostat Grp, Pearl River, NY 10965 USA@Arizona State Univ W, Dept Math & Appl Comp, Glendale, AZ 85306 USA@Los Alamos Natl Lab, Stat Sci Grp, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA::Ozol-Godfrey, A@Samsung Elect, Engn Informat Grp, Hwasung 445701, Kyeungkee, South Korea@Arizona State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA@Wyeth Pharmaceut, Biostat Grp, Pearl River, NY 10965 USA@Arizona State Univ W, Dept Math & Appl Comp, Glendale, AZ 85306 USA@Los Alamos Natl Lab, Stat Sci Grp, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA::Borror, CM@Samsung Elect, Engn Informat Grp, Hwasung 445701, Kyeungkee, South Korea@Arizona State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA@Wyeth Pharmaceut, Biostat Grp, Pearl River, NY 10965 USA@Arizona State Univ W, Dept Math & Appl Comp, Glendale, AZ 85306 USA@Los Alamos Natl Lab, Stat Sci Grp, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA::Anderson-Cook, CM@Samsung Elect, Engn Informat Grp, Hwasung 445701, Kyeungkee, South Korea@Arizona State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA@Wyeth Pharmaceut, Biostat Grp, Pearl River, NY 10965 USA@Arizona State Univ W, Dept Math & Appl Comp, Glendale, AZ 85306 USA@Los Alamos Natl Lab, Stat Sci Grp, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA","Park, YJ@Samsung@Arizona State University@Pfizer@Arizona State University@Los Alamos National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)::Richardson, DE@Samsung@Arizona State University@Pfizer@Arizona State University@Los Alamos National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)::Montgomery, DC@Samsung@Arizona State University@Pfizer@Arizona State University@Los Alamos National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)::Ozol-Godfrey, A@Samsung@Arizona State University@Pfizer@Arizona State University@Los Alamos National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)::Borror, CM@Samsung@Arizona State University@Pfizer@Arizona State University@Los Alamos National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)::Anderson-Cook, CM@Samsung@Arizona State University@Pfizer@Arizona State University@Los Alamos National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)","Park, You-Jin@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1006-5380","Using a genetic algorithm to generate small exact response surface designs+Borkowski, J.J.+J.

Multivariate monitoring using an MEWMA control chart with unequal sample sizes,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2005,29,12,"When multivariate control charts are used to monitor a process, it is usually assumed that the same sample size is used for each variable. In this paper, we investigate the MEWMA control chart for monitoring the process mean vector when the sample sizes are unequal. Unequal sample sizes may arise because of sampling constraints or because the sample sizes of some variables are increased to provide more information about variables that are considered to be more important than other variables. Here we focus on the situation in which one variable is considered to be more important than the other variables, so that the sample size for this variable is increased and the sample sizes of the other variables are decreased. When the correlation between the variables is not high, increasing the sample size of the important variable improves the ability to detect shifts in this variable. However, the ability to detect shifts in the other variables is decreased. We compare the approach of using unequal sample sizes with the approach of using control charts that are designed to be sensitive to the specific shift direction of interest. We also investigate the use of unequal sample sizes along with control charts designed to be sensitive to the shift direction of interest.","average time to signal,EWMA,multivariate exponentially weighted moving average control,chart (MEWMA),projection,statistical process control,steady state,unequal sample size","AVERAGE CONTROL CHART,REGRESSION-ADJUSTED VARIABLES,EWMA CONTROL CHART,QUALITY-CONTROL,PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS,INTEGRAL-EQUATION,RUN-LENGTH","Kim, K@PRA Int, Charlottesville, VA 22911 USA@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Stat & Forestry, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Reynolds, MR@PRA Int, Charlottesville, VA 22911 USA@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Stat & Forestry, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Kim, K@Unknow@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Reynolds, MR@Unknow@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University",not exist,"no title+CHOI S+640 U MINN SCH STAT+2002::MULTIVARIATE GENERALIZATIONS OF CUMULATIVE SUM QUALITY-CONTROL SCHEMES+CROSIER, RB+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 1988::Multivariate statistical process monitoring and diagnosis with grouped regression-adjusted variables+Hauck, DJ; Runger, GC; Montgomery, DC+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+1999::REGRESSION ADJUSTMENT FOR VARIABLES IN MULTIVARIATE QUALITY-CONTROL+HAWKINS, DM+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1993::MULTIVARIATE QUALITY-CONTROL BASED ON REGRESSION-ADJUSTED VARIABLES+HAWKINS, DM+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1991::A NOTE ON MULTIVARIATE CUSUM PROCEDURES+HEALY, JD+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1987::Multivariate quality control+Hotelling, H.+Techniques of statistical analysis+1947::no title+JACKSON JE+USERS GUIDE PRINCIPA+1991::no title+LIU Y+COMPUT IND ENG+1995::A REVIEW OF MULTIVARIATE CONTROL CHARTS+LOWRY, CA; MONTGOMERY, DC+IIE TRANSACTIONS+DEC 1995::A MULTIVARIATE EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE CONTROL CHART+LOWRY, CA; WOODALL, WH; CHAMP, CW; et al.+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1992::ASASIAM series on statistics and applied mathematics+Mason, R.

Resolution IV designs with 128 runs,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2005,11,17,"Chen, Sun, and Wu (1993) enumerated all possible 2(k-P) fractional factorial designs of size 16 and 32 and all resolution four (or higher) fractions of size 64. By enumerating all possible designs, they not only provided the minimum aberration design for each value of k but also listed designs attractive for other reasons, e.g., having the most clear two-factor interactions. Here we present the results of an enumeration of n = 128 run resolution IV designs. As in Chen, Sun, and Wu (1993), we constructed new designs by building up, adding one factor at a time. However, rather than determining whether a new candidate design was isomorphic to an existing design based on a complete permutation check, we retained all designs that differed in their projections. Resolution IV designs are tabulated for k = 12,..., 64 factors.","alias length pattern,hamming distance,isomorphism,projection,row coincidence matrix,weak minimum aberration,word length pattern","FRACTIONAL FACTORIAL-DESIGNS,MINIMUM ABERRATION,2-LEVEL","Block, RM@USAF, Space Analysis Div, Colorado Springs, CO 80914 USA@Univ Tennessee, Dept Stat, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA::Mee, RW@USAF, Space Analysis Div, Colorado Springs, CO 80914 USA@Univ Tennessee, Dept Stat, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA","Block, RM@United States Department of Defense@United States Air Force@University of Tennessee System@University of Tennessee Knoxville::Mee, RW@United States Department of Defense@United States Air Force@University of Tennessee System@University of Tennessee Knoxville",not exist,"Second order saturated resolution IV designs+Block, R.M.; Mee, R.W.+J.

Unit and group-runs chart to identify increases in fraction nonconforming,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2005,8,17,"In this paper, we propose a control chart, called the ""unit and group runs"" (UGR) chart, which is useful to detect an increase in fraction nonconforming. The proposed chart starts with unit-level inspection and switches to the group-level inspection and back to the unit-level inspection according to a specified rule. The UGR chart gives a remarkable reduction in out-of-control average time to signal (ATS) as compared with the run-length CUSUM (Bourke (1991)), Bernoulli CUSUM (Reynolds and Stoumbos (1999)) and the synthetic control chart (Wu et al. (2001)). The proposed chart almost attains the lower bound for the out-of-control ATS and, hence, based on the ATS criterion, it is expected to outperform the other attribute-control charts. The steady-state performance of the proposed chart is also uniformly remarkable as compared with the other matched attribute-control charts. Therefore, the UGR chart for attributes enhances the effectiveness of statistical process control.","average time to signal,Bernoulli CUSUM chart,binomial CUSUM chart,CRL chart,np chart,Poisson CUSUM chart,run-length CUSUM chart,steady state,synthetic control chart",SYNTHETIC CONTROL CHART,"Gadre, MP@Mudhoji Coll, Phaltan 415523, India@Shivaji Univ, Kolhapur 416004, Maharashtra, India::Rattihalli, RN@Mudhoji Coll, Phaltan 415523, India@Shivaji Univ, Kolhapur 416004, Maharashtra, India","Gadre, MP@Unknow@Shivaji University::Rattihalli, RN@Unknow@Shivaji University",not exist,"DETECTING A SHIFT IN FRACTION NONCONFORMING USING RUN-LENGTH CONTROL CHARTS WITH 100-PERCENT INSPECTION+BOURKE, PD+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1991::Evaluating and improving the synthetic control chart+Davis, RB; Woodall, WH+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 2002::A group runs control chart to identify increases in fraction non-conforming+Gadre, M.

Model and distribution-robust process optimization with noise factors,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2005,21,19,"The uncertainty of the model form is typically neglected in process-optimization studies. In addition, not taking into account the existence of noise factors and nonnormal errors may invalidate the conclusions of such studies. In this paper, a Bayesian approach to model-robust process optimization in the presence of noise factors and normormal error terms is presented. Traditionally, in process optimization, methods such as the dual response approach are used in the presence of noise factors, and methods such as robust regression are used when the error terms are not normally distributed. Instead, this paper extends the recently proposed idea of model form-robustness using a Bayesian predictive approach to cases where there is uncertainty due to noise factors and due to the distributional assumptions of the errors. Two examples taken from the literature, one based on a factorial experiment and another based on a mixture experiment, are used to illustrate the proposed approach.","Bayesian optimization,response surface methodology,robust parameter design","RESPONSE-SURFACE OPTIMIZATION,OPTIMAL DESIGNS,T-DISTRIBUTION","Rajagopal, R@Penn State Univ, Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA@GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceut, King Of Prussia, PA 19406 USA@Penn State Univ, Dept Stat, University Pk, PA 16802 USA::Del Castillo, E@Penn State Univ, Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA@GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceut, King Of Prussia, PA 19406 USA@Penn State Univ, Dept Stat, University Pk, PA 16802 USA::Peterson, JJ@Penn State Univ, Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA@GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceut, King Of Prussia, PA 19406 USA@Penn State Univ, Dept Stat, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Rajagopal, R@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University@GlaxoSmithKline@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University::Del Castillo, E@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University@GlaxoSmithKline@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University::Peterson, JJ@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University@GlaxoSmithKline@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University",not exist,"no title+BOX GEP+56 CQPI U WISC MAD+1990::A NONLINEAR-PROGRAMMING SOLUTION TO THE DUAL RESPONSE PROBLEM+DELCASTILLO, E; MONTGOMERY, DC+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1993::Simultaneous Optimization of Several Response Variables+Derringer, G.

Fraction of design space plots for examining model robustness,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2005,36,10,"When choosing between competing designs, it is typical to specify a design space and model on which to base the comparison. The prediction capabilities of the design, specifically G- and V-efficiency using scaled prediction variance (SPV), are based on this chosen model. After the data are collected and individual effects are tested, some terms may not be significant in the model. In this case, the experimenter likely will decide to use a reduced model, which has only a portion of the terms included that were in the original model for which the design was chosen. This paper presents a graphical method for examining design robustness related to the SPV values using fraction of design space (FDS) plots by comparing designs across a number of potential models in a prespecified model space. The FDS plots show the various distributions of the SPV throughout the design space for different models for a chosen design on the same graph. The methods are demonstrated on several examples for different models and on a variety of design spaces.","alphabetical optimality criteria,FDS plot,mixture experiments,model reduction,response surface designs,scaled prediction variance","RESPONSE-SURFACE DESIGNS,SECOND-ORDER DESIGNS,PREDICTION CAPABILITY,RIVAL MODELS,DISCRIMINATION,MIXTURE","Ozol-Godfrey, A@Wyeth Vaccines Res, Pearl River, NY 10965 USA@Los Alamos Natl Nat, Stat Sci Grp, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA@Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA::Anderson-Cook, CM@Wyeth Vaccines Res, Pearl River, NY 10965 USA@Los Alamos Natl Nat, Stat Sci Grp, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA@Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA::Montgomery, DC@Wyeth Vaccines Res, Pearl River, NY 10965 USA@Los Alamos Natl Nat, Stat Sci Grp, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA@Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Ozol-Godfrey, A@Pfizer@Unknow@Arizona State University::Anderson-Cook, CM@Pfizer@Unknow@Arizona State University::Montgomery, DC@Pfizer@Unknow@Arizona State University",not exist,"no title+ANDREARENDON J+J QUAL TECHNOL+1997::SEQUENTIALLY DESIGNED EXPERIMENTS FOR SCREENING OUT BAD MODELS WITH F-TESTS+ANDREWS, DF+BIOMETRIKA+1971::DESIGN OF EXPERIMENTS FOR DISCRIMINATING BETWEEN TWO RIVAL MODELS+ATKINSON, AC; FEDOROV, VV+BIOMETRIKA+1975::A class of optimal robust parameter designs+Bingham, DR; Li, W+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 2002::Comparison of design optimality criteria of reduced models for response surface designs in the hypercube+Borkowski, JJ; Valeroso, ES+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 2001::no title+Box, G.E.P.; Draper, H.R.+Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces+1987::ON THE EXPERIMENTAL ATTAINMENT OF OPTIMUM CONDITIONS+BOX, GEP; WILSON, KB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1951::DISCRIMINATION AMONG MECHANISTIC MODELS+BOX, GEP; HILL, WJ+TECHNOMETRICS+1967::MINIMUM-POINT SECOND-ORDER DESIGNS+BOX, MJ; DRAPER, NR+TECHNOMETRICS+1974::Factor screening and response surface exploration+Cheng, SW; Wu, CFJ+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 2001::Bayesian variable selection with related predictors+Chipman, H+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+MAR 1996::MODEL ROBUST, LINEAR-OPTIMAL DESIGNS+COOK, RD; NACHTSHEIM, CJ+TECHNOMETRICS+1982::no title+Cornell, J.

Optimal weighting of bias and variance in dual response surface optimization,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2005,20,24,"Dual response surface optimization simultaneously considers the mean and the standard deviation of a response. The minimization of the mean squared error (MSE) is a simple, yet effective, approach in dual response surface optimization. The bias and variance components of MSE need to be weighted properly if they are not of the same importance in the given problem situation. To date, the relative weights of bias and variance have been equally set or determined only by the data. However, the weights should be determined in accordance with the tradeoffs on various factors in quality and costs. In this paper, we propose a systematic method to determine the weights of bias and variance in accordance with a decision maker's preference structure regarding the tradeoffs.","decision maker's preferences,mean squared error,relative weights",SYSTEMS,"Jeong, IJ@Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Div Mech & Ind Engn, Pohang 790784, Kyungbuk, South Korea::Kim, KJ@Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Div Mech & Ind Engn, Pohang 790784, Kyungbuk, South Korea::Chang, SY@Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Div Mech & Ind Engn, Pohang 790784, Kyungbuk, South Korea","Jeong, IJ@Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH)::Kim, KJ@Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH)::Chang, SY@Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH)","Kim, Jaejung@F-6964-2013::Kim, Kwang-Jae@F-6959-2013::Chang, Soo@F-7335-2013","no title+Box, G.E.P.; Draper, H.R.+Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces+1987::Dual response optimization via direct function minimization+Copeland, KAF; Nelson, PR+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1996::The computation of global optima in dual response systems+DelCastillo, E; Fan, SK; Semple, J+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1997::A NONLINEAR-PROGRAMMING SOLUTION TO THE DUAL RESPONSE PROBLEM+DELCASTILLO, E; MONTGOMERY, DC+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1993::Dual response surface optimization: a weighted MSE approach+Ding, R; Lin, D; Wei, D.+Quality Engineering+2004::no title+Hillier, FS; Lieberman, GJ.+Introduction to mathematical programming+1995::no title+Hwang, Ching-Lai; Masud, Abu Syed Md.+Multiple Objective Decision Making, Methods and Applications: A State-of-the-Art Survey+1979::no title+Keeney, R.

Analysis of performance measures in experimental designs using jackknife,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2005,12,4,"Experimental designs with performance measures as responses are common in industrial applications. The existing analysis methods often regard performance measures as sole response variables without replicates. Consequently, no degrees of freedom are left for error variance estimation in these methods. In reality, performance measures are obtained from replicated primary-response variables. Precious information is hence lost. In this paper, we suggest a jackknife-based approach on the replicated primary responses to provide an estimate of error variance of performance measures. The resulting tests for factor effects become easy to construct and more reliable. We compare the proposed method with some existing methods using two real examples and investigate the consistency of the jackknife variance estimate based on simulation studies.","Lenth's method,performance measure,Pseudo standard error,unreplicated factorial experiments",TO-NOISE RATIOS,"Variyath, AM@Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada@Nankai Univ, Dept Stat, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China::Abraham, B@Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada@Nankai Univ, Dept Stat, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China::Chen, JH@Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada@Nankai Univ, Dept Stat, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China","Variyath, AM@University of Waterloo@Nankai University::Abraham, B@University of Waterloo@Nankai University::Chen, JH@University of Waterloo@Nankai University","Chen, Jiahua@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8064-4444","SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIOS, PERFORMANCE CRITERIA, AND TRANSFORMATIONS+BOX, G+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1988::DISPERSION EFFECTS FROM FRACTIONAL DESIGNS+BOX, GEP; MEYER, RD+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1986::Use of half-normal plots in interpreting factorial two level experiments+Daniel, C.+Technometrics+1959::no title+Efron, B; Tibshirani, R.+An introduction to the bootstrap+1993::Analyzing unreplicated factorial experiments: A review with some new proposals+Hamada, M; Balakrishnan, N+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 1998::QUICK AND EASY ANALYSIS OF UNREPLICATED FACTORIALS+LENTH, RV+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1989::PERFORMANCE-MEASURES INDEPENDENT OF ADJUSTMENT - AN EXPLANATION AND EXTENSION OF TAGUCHIS SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIOS+LEON, RV; SHOEMAKER, AC; KACKER, RN+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 1987::no title+PHADKE SM+QUANLITY ENG USING R+1989::no title+Shao, J.; Tu, D.+The Jackknife and Bootstrap+1995::no title+Taguchi, G.+Introduction to Quality Engineering+1986::no title+WU JCF+EXPT PLANNING ANAL P+2000::Critical values of the lenth method for unreplicated factorial designs+Ye, KQ; Hamada, M+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2000"

This paper presents the excursion-at-target algorithm for the construction of minimum G aberration designs. A new criterion is introduced that is computationally simpler to apply than minimum G aberration, and it is put to use in the excursion-at-target algorithm as a time-saving surrogate. Although the algorithm cannot guarantee minimum G aberration, we have shown that excursion-at-target performs well and often results in the best designs. A complete table of minimum or near-minimum G aberration designs of 24 runs accommodating between three and 23 factors is given.

Response surface designs within a split-plot structure,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2005,14,63,"In many industrial experiments, time and/or cost constraints often force certain factors in a designed experiment to be much harder to change than others. An appropriate approach to such an experiment restricts the randomization, which leads to a split-plot structure. This paper first establishes how one can modify the common central-composite design to efficiently accommodate a split-plot structure. The proposed designs allow pure-error estimates of the two variance components. We next discuss the conditions on the design that make ordinary least squares and weighted least squares estimates equivalent. These conditions are easy to obtain in practice. An important consequence is that people can use standard experimental design software to analyze second-order response surfaces. We give examples of central composite and Box-Behnken designs that meet the conditions. We conclude with an example.","central composite designs,design of experiments,split-plot experiments",,"Vining, GG@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA@Minitab Inc, State Coll, PA 16801 USA@Arizona State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA::Kowalski, SM@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA@Minitab Inc, State Coll, PA 16801 USA@Arizona State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA::Montgomery, DC@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA@Minitab Inc, State Coll, PA 16801 USA@Arizona State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Vining, GG@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University@Unknow@Arizona State University::Kowalski, SM@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University@Unknow@Arizona State University::Montgomery, DC@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University@Unknow@Arizona State University",not exist,"The design and analysis of 2(k-p) x 2(q-r) split plot experiments+Bisgaard, S+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2000::The design and analysis of 2(k-p)xs prototype experiments+Bisgaard, S; Steinberg, DM+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1997::Some new three level designs for the study of quantitative variables+Box, G.

A dual-response approach to robust parameter design for a generalized linear model,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2005,28,22,"Robust Parameter Design (RPD) has been used extensively in industrial experiments since its introduction by Genichi Taguchi. RPD has been studied and applied, in most cases, assuming a linear model under standard assumptions. More recently, RPD has been considered in a generalized linear model (GLM) setting. In this paper, we apply a general dual-response approach when using RPD in the case of a GLM. We motivate the need for exploring both the process mean and process variance by discussing situations when a compromise between the two is necessary. Several examples are provided in order to further motivate the need for applying a dual-response approach when applying RPD in the case of a GLM.","dual-response approach,dispersion effects,generalized linear models,noise variables,response surface methodology,robust parameter design","QUALITY-IMPROVEMENT EXPERIMENTS,TAGUCHI","Myers, WR@Procter & Gamble Co, Biometr & Stat Sci Dept, Stat Qual Control Sect, Mason, OH 45040 USA@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Brenneman, WA@Procter & Gamble Co, Biometr & Stat Sci Dept, Stat Qual Control Sect, Mason, OH 45040 USA@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Myers, RH@Procter & Gamble Co, Biometr & Stat Sci Dept, Stat Qual Control Sect, Mason, OH 45040 USA@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Myers, WR@Procter & Gamble@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Brenneman, WA@Procter & Gamble@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Myers, RH@Procter & Gamble@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University",not exist,"Designs of mixed resolution for process robustness studies+Borkowski, JJ; Lucas, JM+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1997::SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIOS, PERFORMANCE CRITERIA, AND TRANSFORMATIONS+BOX, G+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1988::A NONLINEAR-PROGRAMMING SOLUTION TO THE DUAL RESPONSE PROBLEM+DELCASTILLO, E; MONTGOMERY, DC+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1993::A generalized linear modeling approach to robust design+Engel, J; Huele, AF+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1996::Generalized linear models for quality-improvement experiments+Hamada, M; Nelder, JA+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1997::Joint optimization of mean and standard deviation using response surface methods+Koksoy, O+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 2003::Generalized linear models for the analysis of quality-improvement experiments+Lee, Y; Nelder, JA+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+MAR 1998::Robust design via generalized linear models+Lee, Y; Nelder, JA+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2003::Examples of designed experiments with nonnormal responses+Lewis, SL; Montgomery, DC; Myers, RH+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 2001::Dual response surface optimization+Lin, DKJ; Tu, W.+Journal of Quality Technology+1995::HOW TO ACHIEVE A ROBUST PROCESS USING RESPONSE-SURFACE METHODOLOGY+LUCAS, JM+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 1994::no title+McCullagh, P.; Nelder, J.

Multivariate monitoring of the process mean vector with sequential sampling,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2005,44,20,"Multivariate control charts are used to monitor a process when more than one quality variable associated with the process is being observed. The standard practice when using any control chart to monitor a process is to take samples of fixed size at regular sampling intervals. Here we investigate multivariate exponentially weighted moving average (MEWMA) control charts based on sequential sampling. When sequential sampling is used, observations at a sampling point are taken in groups of one or more observations, and the number of groups actually taken is a random variable that depends on the data. The basic idea is that sampling starts with a small initial group of observations, and no additional sampling is done at this point if there is no indication of a problem with the process. If there is some indication of a problem with the process, then an additional group or groups of observations is taken at this sampling point. A signal is given after any group if there is a strong indication of a problem with the process. The performance of the MEWMA control chart based on sequential sampling is compared with the performance of standard control charts. It is shown that the MEWMA chart based on sequential sampling is much more efficient in detecting changes in the process mean vector than standard control charts based on nonsequential sampling. Sequential sampling performs best when there is the possibility of many groups at each sampling point, but sequential sampling is still substantially better than nonsequential sampling when only two groups are allowed.","average time to signal,multivariate exponentially weighted moving average control,chart,statistical process control,variable sample size,variable sampling rate","INTERVAL CONTROL CHARTS,AVERAGE CONTROL CHART,T-2 CONTROL CHART,(X)OVER-BAR CHART,FIXED TIMES,INDIVIDUAL OBSERVATIONS,INTEGRAL-EQUATION,MEWMA CHART,RUN-LENGTH,SIZE","Reynolds, MR@Virginia Tech, Dept Stat & Forestry, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA@PRA Int, Charlottesville, VA 22911 USA::Kim, K@Virginia Tech, Dept Stat & Forestry, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA@PRA Int, Charlottesville, VA 22911 USA","Reynolds, MR@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University@Unknow::Kim, K@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University@Unknow",not exist,"AN ADAPTIVE SAMPLE-SIZE CUSUM CONTROL CHART+ANNADI, HP; KEATS, JB; RUNGER, GC; et al.+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH+JUN 1995::A comparison of T-2 control charts with variable sampling schemes as opposed to MEWMA chart+Aparisi, F; Haro, CL+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH+JUL 2003::Hotelling's T-2 control chart with variable sampling intervals+Aparisi, F; Haro, CL+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH+SEP 2001::Hotelling's T-2 control chart with adaptive sample sizes+Aparisi, F+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH+OCT 1996::no title+ARNOLD JC+J QUAL TECHNOL+2001::AN APPLICATION OF VARIABLE SAMPLING INTERVAL CONTROL CHARTS+BAXLEY, RV+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 1995::A program for approximating the in-control ARL for the MEWMA chart+Bodden, KM; Rigdon, SE+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 1999::Combined double sampling and variable sampling interval (X)over-bar chart+Carot, V; Jabaloyes, JM; Carot, T+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH+JUN 2002::(X)over-bar chart with variable sample size and sampling intervals+Costa, AFB+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 1997::(X)OVER-BAR CHARTS WITH VARIABLE SAMPLE-SIZE+COSTA, AFB+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1994::Control charts for a double-sampling scheme based on average production run lengths+Croasdale, R.+Int J Prod Res+1974::DOUBLE SAMPLING (X)BAR CHARTS+DAUDIN, JJ+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 1992::no title+Duncan, A.

Robust monitoring of contaminated data,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2005,9,16,"Monitoring a process that has contaminated data with traditional control charts such as Shewhart's (X) over bar chart and the Range chart results in an excessive number of false alarms. Robust control charts such as the Median and IQR charts are a better alternative to traditional charts for a process with contaminated data because the effects of the outlying data values are eliminated. However, process shifts are not detected as quickly with the robust charts. This paper introduces a diagnostic statistic technique that uses traditional control chart methods augmented by diagnostic tools. Performance measures for traditional, robust, and diagnostic statistic control chart systems for n = 5 are reported. Contour plots for n = 3 and n = 5 are provided to allow for interpolation of parameter values. The diagnostic statistic technique improves work stoppage (comparable to average run length) rates for contaminated data and maintains the ability to identify process shifts.","contamination,control charting,outlier,statistical process control",CHARTS,"Davis, CM@Univ Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA::Adams, BM@Univ Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA","Davis, CM@University of Alabama System@University of Alabama Tuscaloosa::Adams, BM@University of Alabama System@University of Alabama Tuscaloosa",not exist,"DESIGN OF EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE SCHEMES+CROWDER, SV+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1989::no title+DAVIS CM+THESIS U ALABAMA TUS+2002::TRIMMED MEAN XBAR AND R-CHARTS+LANGENBERG, P; IGLEWICZ, B+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1986::ADJUSTING FOR DATA CONTAMINATION IN STATISTICAL-INFERENCE+MCDONALD, GC+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 1994::SCREENING OUTLIERS IN PROCESS-CONTROL REGRESSION DATA WITH UNIFORM RESIDUALS .2.+QUESENBERRY, CP+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 1990::no title+Shewhart, W.A.+Economic Control of Quality of manufactured Products+1931::A comparison of multivariate control charts for individual observations+Sullivan, JH; Woodall, WH+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 1996::no title+VARCAS NJA+J QUAL TECHNOL+2003::A SIMULTANEOUS CONTROL CHART+WHITE, EM; SCHROEDER, R+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 1987"

In this article, we extend the current jumping model from the continuous case to the discrete case to track and monitor the changes in attribute data. In this method, the jumping model-based posterior distribution of the process mean is constructed with attribute data and prior knowledge of the process. The posterior distribution consists of several components that account for the weights of the process to be ""in-control"" or ""out-of-control."" Using the component representing the in-control weight as the monitoring index, a jumping model-based control chart is developed to monitor the attribute data process. The proposed chart is further extended to cover different out-of-control modes. The performance of the jumping model-based chart is investigated and compared to conventional control charts through numerical studies and a real-world data set. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed chart.","attribute control chart,jumping model,statistical process monitoring","CONTROL CHARTS,PERFORMANCE,SUBJECT","Wang, Chao@Univ Wisconsin, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Madison, WI USA::Zhou, Shiyu@Univ Wisconsin, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Madison, WI USA","Wang, Chao@University of Wisconsin System@University of Wisconsin Madison::Zhou, Shiyu@University of Wisconsin System@University of Wisconsin Madison",not exist,"Posterior Distribution Charts: A Bayesian Approach for Graphically Exploring a Process Mean+Apley, Daniel W.+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 2012::CONTROL CHARTS AND STOCHASTIC-PROCESSES+BARNARD, GA+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1959::A Bayesian sequential look at U-control charts+Bayarri, MJ; Garcia-Donato, G+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 2005::APPROACH TO PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION OF CUSUM RUN LENGTH+BROOK, D; EVANS, DA+BIOMETRIKA+1972::Design and performance analysis of the exponentially weighted moving average mean estimate for processes subject to random step changes+Chen, A; Elsayed, EA+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 2002::ESTIMATING CURRENT MEAN OF NORMAL-DISTRIBUTION WHICH IS SUBJECTED TO CHANGES IN TIME+CHERNOFF, H; ZACKS, S+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1964::Monitoring of Multiple Binary Data Streams using a Hierarchical Model Structure+Das, Devashish; Chen, Yong; Zhou, Shiyu; et al.+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+JUN 2016::LINEAR DYNAMIC RECURSIVE ESTIMATION FROM VIEWPOINT OF REGRESSION-ANALYSIS+DUNCAN, DB; HORN, SD+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1972::On the average run lengths of quality control schemes using a Markov chain approach+Fu, JC; Spiring, FA; Xie, HS+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+FEB 15 2002::COUNTED DATA CUSUMS+LUCAS, JM+TECHNOMETRICS+1985::Plotting basic control charts: tutorial notes for healthcare practitioners+Mohammed, M.

Some perspectives on nonparametric statistical process control,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,10.1080/00224065.2018.1404315,2018,83,0,"Statistical process control (SPC) charts play a central role in quality control and management. Many conventional SPC charts are designed under the assumption that the related process distribution is normal. In practice, the normality assumption is often invalid. In such cases, some articles show that certain conventional SPC charts are robust and can still be used as long as their parameters are properly chosen. Some other articles argue that results from such conventional SPC charts would not be reliable and that nonparametric SPC charts should be considered instead. In recent years, many nonparametric SPC charts have been proposed. Most of them are based on the ranking information in process observations collected at different time points. Some of them are based on data categorization and categorical data analysis. In this article, we give some perspectives on issues related to the robustness of conventional SPC charts and to the strengths and limitations of various nonparametric SPC charts.","data categorization,distribution-free,log-linear modeling,multivariate distribution,non-gaussian data,nonparametric procedures,normality,ordering,ranking","EWMA CONTROL CHART,MULTIVARIATE CONTROL CHARTS,CUSUM CONTROL CHARTS,POINT CONTROL CHART,PHASE-I,QUALITY-CONTROL,DATA DEPTH,INDIVIDUAL OBSERVATIONS,UNIVARIATE PROCESSES,CONTROL SCHEMES","Qiu, Peihua@Univ Florida, Dept Biostat, 2004 Mowry Rd, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA","Qiu, Peihua@University of Florida@State University System of Florida",not exist,"no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical Data Analysis+2002::CONTROL CHART BASED ON THE HODGES-LEHMANN ESTIMATOR+ALLOWAY, JA; RAGHAVACHARI, M+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 1991::Nonparametric CUSUM Control Charts and Their Use in Two-Stage SPC Applications+Ambartsoumian, Tatevik; Jeske, Daniel R.+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 2015::NONPARAMETRIC QUALITY-CONTROL CHARTS BASED ON THE SIGN STATISTIC+AMIN, RW; REYNOLDS, MR; BAKIR, S+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1995::A distribution-free shewhart quality control chart based on signed-ranks+Bakir, ST.+Qual Eng+2004::NONPARAMETRIC PROCEDURE FOR PROCESS-CONTROL BASED ON WITHIN-GROUP RANKING+BAKIR, ST; REYNOLDS, MR+TECHNOMETRICS+1979::Two simple Shewhart-type multivariate nonparametric control charts+Boone, J.

Response modelling approach to robust parameter design methodology using supersaturated designs,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,10.1080/00224065.2018.1404316,2018,15,0,"In recent years, both robust parameter designs (RPDs) and supersaturated designs (SSDs) have attracted a great deal of attention. In the present article, a combination of the above two techniques is considered. More precisely, we propose a construction of an effective SSD along with an analysis method in order to deal with the significant problem of the robust parameter design methodology (RPDM). Combining iterative Sure Independence Screening (SIS) variable selection and a penalized method, namely smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD), we perform an analysis of the SSDs developed in the present work. The proposed methodology is applied in different models so as to show its effectiveness in many different scenarios, assuming both first-and second-order models of a response surface design. Two illustrative examples as well as numerous numerical experiments are conducted for plenty of cases. The results imply that the proposed method is highly effective for identifying the active effects of main factors, two-factor interactions, three-factor interactions, and the pure quadratic ones, under the assumption of effect sparsity.","Fold-over design,Hadamard matrices,penalized methods,SCAD,sure independence screening","SELECTION,TAGUCHI","Chatterjee, Kashinath@Visva Bharati Univ, Dept Stat, Santini Ketan, W Bengal, India::Drosou, Krystallenia@Natl Tech Univ Athens, Dept Math, Athens, Greece::Georgi, Stelios D.@RMIT Univ, Sch Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia::Koukouvinos, Christos@Natl Tech Univ Athens, Dept Math, Athens, Greece","Chatterjee, Kashinath@Visva Bharati University::Drosou, Krystallenia@National Technical University of Athens::Georgi, Stelios D.@Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT)::Koukouvinos, Christos@National Technical University of Athens","Georgiou, Stelios@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5096-0067","AN ANALYSIS FOR UNREPLICATED FRACTIONAL FACTORIALS+BOX, GEP; MEYER, RD+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1986::SMOOTHING NOISY DATA WITH SPLINE FUNCTIONS - ESTIMATING THE CORRECT DEGREE OF SMOOTHING BY THE METHOD OF GENERALIZED CROSS-VALIDATION+CRAVEN, P; WAHBA, G+NUMERISCHE MATHEMATIK+1979::Sure independence screening for ultrahigh dimensional feature space+Fan, Jianqing; Lv, Jinchi+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+NOV 2008::Variable selection via nonconcave penalized likelihood and its oracle properties+Fan, JQ; Li, RZ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2001::A STATISTICAL VIEW OF SOME CHEMOMETRICS REGRESSION TOOLS+FRANK, IE; FRIEDMAN, JH+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 1993::Supersaturated designs: A review of their construction and analysis+Georgiou, Stelios D.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+JAN 2014::An experiment to compare Taguchi's product array and the combined array+Kunert, J.; Auer, C.; Erdbruege, M.; et al.+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2007::Data analysis in supersaturated designs+Li, RZ; Lin, DKJ+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+SEP 1 2002::Robust Parameter Design Using a Supersaturated Design for a Response Surface Model+Matsuura, Shun; Suzuki, Hideo; Iida, Takahisa; et al.+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+JUN 2011::RESPONSE-SURFACE ALTERNATIVES TO THE TAGUCHI ROBUST PARAMETER DESIGN APPROACH+MYERS, RH; KHURI, AI; VINING, G+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1992::ECONOMICAL EXPERIMENTATION METHODS FOR ROBUST DESIGN+SHOEMAKER, AC; TSUI, KL; WU, CFJ+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1991::no title+Taguchi, G.+System of Experimental Design+1987::Regression shrinkage and selection via the Lasso+Tibshirani, R+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1996::COMBINING TAGUCHI AND RESPONSE-SURFACE PHILOSOPHIES - A DUAL RESPONSE APPROACH+VINING, GG; MYERS, RH+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 1990::no title+Wu, CFJ; Hamada, M.+Experiments: planning, analysis and parameter design optimization+2009"
Robust split-plot designs for model misspecification,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,10.1080/00224065.2018.1404325,2018,30,0,"Many existing methods for constructing optimal split-plot designs, such as D-optimal or A-optimal designs, focus only on minimizing the variance of the parameter estimates for the fitted model. However, the true model is usually more complicated; hence, the fitted model is often misspecified. If significant effects not included in the model exist, then the estimates could be highly biased. Therefore a good split-plot design should be able to simultaneously control the variance and the bias of the estimates. In this article, I propose a new method for constructing optimal split-plot designs that are robust under model misspecification. Four examples are provided to demonstrate that my method can produce efficient split-plot designs with smaller overall aliasing.

Online profile monitoring for surgical outcomes using a weighted score test,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,10.1080/00224065.2018.1404329,2018,32,0,"In the past decade, risk-adjusted control charts have been widely used to monitor surgical outcomes. However, most existing approaches focus on monitoring shifts in location parameters and may not be able to detect a scale change that is also likely to occur in surgical data. In this article, we derive a weighted score test statistic to construct an exponentially weighted moving average chart and propose a new charting method to simultaneously monitor location and scale parameters. This new chart may be applied to monitoring surgical performance. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method is more efficient than existing methods, such as the risk-adjusted cumulative sum chart, in detecting the heterogeneity of surgical outcomes. A data set from the Surgical Outcome Monitoring and Improvement Program in Hong Kong is used to illustrate the applicability of the proposed chart.","Weighted test score,GLMM,EWMA chart,Phase II monitoring,surgical outcome","GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,CARDIAC-SURGERY,MOVING AVERAGE,CONTROL CHARTS,HOMOGENEITY,TIME,PERFORMANCE,IMPROVEMENT,QUALITY","Liu, Liu@Sichuan Normal Univ, Sch Math Sci, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China::Lai, Xin@Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Manegement, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China@Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Jockey Club Sch Publ Hlth & PrimaryCare, Div Biostat, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China::Zhang, Jian@Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Math Sci, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China::Tsung, Fugee@Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Logist Management, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Liu, Liu@Sichuan Normal University::Lai, Xin@Chinese University of Hong Kong@Xi'an Jiaotong University::Zhang, Jian@University of Electronic Science & Technology of China::Tsung, Fugee@Hong Kong University of Science & Technology",not exist,"Monitoring patient survival times in surgical systems using a risk-adjusted AFT regression chart+Asadayyoobi, N.; Niaki, S.

Dimension reduction for a multivariate time series process of a regenerative glass furnace,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,10.1080/00224065.2018.1404327,2018,36,0,"Conventional dimension-reduction methods for multivariate time series have been based on the inherent assumption that the noise is white and therefore uninformative. While this assumption may have been realistic for a number of applications, it is violated in the case of a large industrial furnace that we discuss in this article. The article introduces a novel method that is used for dimension reduction of a multivariate time series process for which the underlying common factors as well as the contaminating noise are autocorrelated. Using simulation studies, it is shown that the proposed method uncovers the common factors more accurately than some of the other conventional methods. Applying the method to the furnace data also correctly reveals features of the process that other methods fail to capture. An important feature of the proposed method is that it is practical and requires neither extensive statistical modeling nor deep subject-matter knowledge of the data-generating process.","autoregressive integrated moving average process,common factors,glass manufacturing,principal component analysis","PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS,MODELS,PCA,CHARTS","Huang, Xuan@Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Management Informat Syst & Quantitat Methods, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA::Khachatryan, Davit@Babson Coll, Div Math & Sci, Babson Pk, MA 02157 USA","Huang, Xuan@University of Alabama System@University of Alabama Birmingham::Khachatryan, Davit@Babson College",not exist,"NESTED REDUCED-RANK AUTOREGRESSIVE MODELS FOR MULTIPLE TIME-SERIES+AHN, SK; REINSEL, GC+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1988::TIME-SERIES MODELING FOR STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL+ALWAN, LC; ROBERTS, HV+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JAN 1988::Two projection methods for use in the analysis of multivariate process data with an illustration in petrochemical production+Badcock, J; Bailey, TC; Jonathan, P; et al.+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 2004::Visualizing principal components analysis for multivariate process data+Bisgaard, Soren; Huang, Xuan+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 2008::CANONICAL ANALYSIS OF MULTIPLE TIME-SERIES+BOX, GEP; TIAO, GC+BIOMETRIKA+1977::FUNDS, FACTORS, AND DIVERSIFICATION IN ARBITRAGE PRICING-MODELS+CHAMBERLAIN, G+ECONOMETRICA+1983::Overview of PCA-Based Statistical Process-Monitoring Methods for Time-Dependent, High-Dimensional Data+de Ketelaere, Bart; Hubert, Mia; Schmitt, Eric+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 2015::The statistical theory of linear systems+Deistler, M.; Hannan, E.

A comparison of traditional and maximum likelihood approaches to estimating thermal indices for polymeric materials,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,10.1080/00224065.2018.1406770,2018,16,0,"Accelerated destructive degradation testing (ADDT) is a widely used technique for long-term material property evaluation. One area of application is in determining the thermal index (TI) of polymeric materials including thermoplastic, thermosetting, and elastomeric materials. There are two approaches to estimating a TI based on data collected from ADDT: the traditional and maximum likelihood (ML) procedures. The traditional procedure is specified in current industrial standards and is widely used in industrial applications. The ML procedure is frequently used in the statistical literature but rarely seen in industrial ADDT applications. At present, the ML procedure is not specified in the current standards. In this article, we compare both approaches with two motivating data sets from the literature and simulation studies. We show that the ML procedure has many advantages over the traditional procedure in terms of estimation performance, uncertainty quantification, material comparisons, and predictions. The comparisons and discussion in this article can be useful in designation of statistical methods for future industrial standards.","accelerated destructive degradation test,conditional prediction,IEEE standards,relative thermal index,UL standards,uncertainty quantification",,"King, Caleb B.@Sandia Natl Labs, Stat Sci Grp, Albuquerque, NM 87123 USA::Xie, Yimeng@Virginia Tech, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA USA::Hong, Yili@Virginia Tech, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA USA::Van Mullekorn, Jennifer H.@DuPont Co Inc, DuPont Protect Solut, Richmond, VA USA::DeHart, Stephanie P.@Eastman Chem Co, Appl Stat Grp, Kingsport, TN 37662 USA::DeFeo, Patrick A.@DuPont Co Inc, Appl Stat, Wilmington, DE USA","King, Caleb B.@United States Department of Energy (DOE)@Sandia National Laboratory::Xie, Yimeng@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Hong, Yili@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Van Mullekorn, Jennifer H.@DuPont::DeHart, Stephanie P.@Eastman Chemical Company::DeFeo, Patrick A.@DuPont",not exist,"Accelerated destructive degradation tests: Data, models, and analysis+Escobar, L.

One is based on the bootstrap approach (Saleh et al. (2015)), and the other is an analytical approach (Goedhart, Schoonhoven, and Does (2017)). Although both methods lead to the desired control chart performance, they are still difficult to implement by the practitioner. The bootstrap is rather computationally intensive, while the analytical approach consists of multiple integrals and derivatives. In this letter to the editor we simplify the analytical expressions provided in Goedhart, Schoonhoven, and Does (2017) by using the theory on tolerance intervals for individual observations as given in Krishnamoorthy and Mathew (2009).","control limits,tolerance intervals,bootstrap,statistical process monitoring",,"Goedhart, Rob@Univ Amsterdam, Dept Operat Management, Plantage Muidergracht 12, NL-1018 TV Amsterdam, Netherlands::Schoonhoven, Marit@Univ Amsterdam, Dept Operat Management, Plantage Muidergracht 12, NL-1018 TV Amsterdam, Netherlands::Does, Ronald J.

Complexity imposes unique challenges on big data analytics. Meeker and Hong (2014; Quality Engineering, pp. 102-16) provided an extensive discussion of the opportunities and challenges on big data and reliability; they also described engineering systems which generate big data that can be used in reliability analysis. Meeker and Hong (2014) focused on large-scale system operating and environment data (i.e., high-frequency multivariate time series data) and provided examples on how to link such data as covariates to traditional reliability responses such as time to failure, time to recurrence of events, and degradation measurements. This article intends to extend that discussion by focusing on how to use data with complicated structures to do reliability analysis. Such data types include high-dimensional sensor data, functional curve data, and image streams. We first provide a review of recent developments in those directions, then we provide a discussion on how analytical methods can be developed to tackle the challenging aspects that arise from the complex features of big data in reliability applications. The use of modern statistical methods such as variable selection, functional data analysis, scalar-on-image regression, spatio-temporal data models, and machine-learning techniques will also be discussed.","Clustering,degradation data,functional data,machine learning,reliability prediction,spatio-temporal data","INVERSE GAUSSIAN PROCESS,FUNCTIONAL DATA-ANALYSIS,VARIABLE SELECTION,DEGRADATION DATA,WARRANTY CLAIMS,RECURRENCE DATA,GAMMA PROCESSES,MODEL,REGRESSION,OPPORTUNITIES","Hong, Yili@Virginia Tech, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Zhang, Man@Virginia Tech, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Meeker, William Q.@Iowa State Univ, Dept Stat, Ames, IA USA","Hong, Yili@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Zhang, Man@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Meeker, William Q.@Iowa State University",not exist,"Opportunities to empower statisticians in emerging areas+Anderson-Cook, Christine M.+APPLIED STOCHASTIC MODELS IN BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY+JAN-FEB 2015::Multivariate frailty models for multi-type recurrent event data and its application to cancer prevention trial+Bedair, Khaled; Hong, Yili; Li, Jie; et al.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+SEP 2016::A data-level fusion approach for degradation modeling and prognostic analysis under multiple failure modes+Chehade, Abdallah; Song, Changyue; Liu, Kaibo; et al.+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+2018::Uncertainty quantification for monotone stochastic degradation models+Chen, Piao; Ye, Zhi-Sheng+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+2018::no title+Cressie, N.; Wikle, C.K.+Statistics for Spatio-Temporal Data+2011::Accelerated destructive degradation tests: Data, models, and analysis+Escobar, L.

A data-level fusion approach for degradation modeling and prognostic analysis under multiple failure modes,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,10.1080/00224065.2018.1436829,2018,44,1,"Operating units, in practice, often suffer from multiple modes of failure, and each failure mode has a distinct influence on the service life cycle path of a unit. The rapid development of sensor and communication technologies has enabled multiple sensors to simultaneously monitor and track the health status of a unit in real time. However, one challenging question that remains to be resolved is how to leverage data from multiple sensors for better degradation modeling and prognostic analysis, especially when there are multiple failure modes. Currently, many of the existing approaches in prognostics either (a) fail to capture the dependency between sensors and instead focus on analyzing each sensor independently or (b) fail to incorporate the failure-mode diagnosis for better degradation modeling and prognostics during condition monitoring. To address the limitations in the existing literature, we propose a data-level fusion methodology to construct a composite failure-mode index, named FM-INDEX, via the fusion of multiple sensor data. Our goal is to utilize the FM-INDEX to better characterize the failure mode of an operating unit in real time, thus leading to better degradation modeling and prognostic analysis. A case study that involves the degradation data set of an aircraft gas turbine engine with two potential failure modes is conducted to numerically evaluate the performance of our proposed method compared to other techniques in the related literature.","big data,condition monitoring,data fusion,health index,multiple sensors","CONDITION-BASED MAINTENANCE,RESIDUAL-LIFE DISTRIBUTIONS,MULTISENSOR DATA FUSION,DECISION-MAKING,FAULT-DETECTION,DIAGNOSIS,MACHINES,SYSTEM,SELECTION","Chehade, Abdallah@Univ Michigan, Dept Ind & Mfg Syst Engn, Dearborn, MI 48128 USA::Song, Changyue@Univ Wisconsin, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Madison, WI USA::Liu, Kaibo@Univ Wisconsin, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Madison, WI USA::Saxena, Abhinav@GE Global Res Ctr, Machine Learning Lab, Software Sci & Analyt, San Ramon, CA USA::Zhang, Xi@Peking Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chehade, Abdallah@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan::Song, Changyue@University of Wisconsin System@University of Wisconsin Madison::Liu, Kaibo@University of Wisconsin System@University of Wisconsin Madison::Saxena, Abhinav@General Electric::Zhang, Xi@Peking University",not exist,"Acoustic Emission Signal Analysis and Artificial Intelligence Techniques in Machine Condition Monitoring and Fault Diagnosis: A Review+Ali, Yasir Hassan; Rahman, Roslan Abd; Hamzah, Raja Ishak Raja+JURNAL TEKNOLOGI+2014::Engine fault diagnosis based on multi-sensor information fusion using Dempster-Shafer evidence theory+Basir, Otman; Yuan, Xiaohong+INFORMATION FUSION+OCT 2007::no title+Bishop, C.

A statistical modeling approach for spatio-temporal degradation data,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,10.1080/00224065.2018.1436833,2018,42,1,"This article investigates the modeling of a new type of degradation data: spatio-temporal degradation data collected from a spatial domain over time. Like existing stochastic degradation models, a random field is constructed to describe the spatio-temporal degradation process. We model the degradation process as an additive superposition of two stochastic components: a dynamic spatial degradation generation process and a spatio-temporal propagation process. Some common challenges are addressed, including the spatial heterogeneity of the degradation process, spatial propagation of degradation to neighboring areas, anisotropic and space-time non-separable covariance structures associated with a complex spatio-temporal degradation process, and the computational issues related to parameter estimation and simulation. When spatial dependence is ignored, we show that the proposed spatio-temporal degradation model incorporates some existing purely time-dependent degradation models as its special cases. We also show the connection, under special conditions, between the proposed statistical model and a class of physical-degradation processes given by stochastic partial differential equations. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate modeling approach, parameter estimation, model validation, and applications.","convolution,physics-based statistical modeling,random field,spatio-temporal models,stochastic process","STATIONARY COVARIANCE FUNCTIONS,GAUSSIAN RANDOM-FIELDS,SPACE-TIME DATA,FAILURE,ENVIRONMENTS","Liu, Xiao@Univ Arkansas, Dept Ind Engn, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA::Yeo, Kyongmin@IBM TJ Watson Res Ctr, Yorktown Hts, NY USA::Kalagnanam, Jayant@IBM TJ Watson Res Ctr, Yorktown Hts, NY USA","Liu, Xiao@University of Arkansas System@University of Arkansas Fayetteville::Yeo, Kyongmin@International Business Machines (IBM)::Kalagnanam, Jayant@International Business Machines (IBM)",not exist,"A global approach for solving evolutive heat transfer for image denoising and inpainting+Auclair-Fortier, Marie-Flavie; Ziou, Djemel+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING+SEP 2006::A nonlinear random-coefficients model for degradation testing+Bae, SJ; Kvam, PH+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 2004::no title+Banerjee, S; Carlin, BP; Gelfand, AE.+Hierarchical modeling and analysis for spatial data+2004::Bayesian modeling for large spatial datasets+Banerjee, Sudipto; Fuentes, Montserrat+WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS+JAN-FEB 2012::FATIGUE FAILURE MODELS - BIRNBAUM-SAUNDERS VS INVERSE GAUSSIAN+BHATTACHARYYA, GK; FRIES, A+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY+1982::Degradation modeling for real-time estimation of residual lifetimes in dynamic environments+Bian, Linkan; Gebraeel, Nagi; Kharoufeh, Jeffrey P.+IIE TRANSACTIONS+MAY 4 2015::On fractional Gaussian random fields simulations+Brouste, Alexandre; Istas, Jacques; Lambert-Lacroix, Sophie+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL SOFTWARE+NOV 2007::Blur-generated non-separable space-time models+Brown, PE; Karesen, KF; Roberts, GO; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2000::Dynamic factor process convolution models for multivariate space - time data with application to air quality assessment+Calder, Catherine A.+ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL STATISTICS+SEP 2007::Ozone exposure and population density in Harris County, Texas+Carroll, RJ; Chen, R; George, EI; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1997::Classes of nonseparable, spatio-temporal stationary covariance functions+Cressie, N; Huang, HC+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1999::ROBUST ESTIMATION OF THE VARIOGRAM .1.+CRESSIE, N; HAWKINS, DM+JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR MATHEMATICAL GEOLOGY+1980::Gaining Physical Insights from Degradation Data+Doganaksoy, Necip; Hall, David B.+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 2013::MODELS FOR VARIABLE-STRESS ACCELERATED LIFE TESTING EXPERIMENTS BASED ON WIENER-PROCESSES AND THE INVERSE GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTION+DOKSUM, KA; HOYLAND, A+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1992::Modeling and predicting complex space-time structures and patterns of coastal wind fields+Fuentes, M; Chen, L; Davis, JM; et al.+ENVIRONMETRICS+AUG 2005::Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Total Nitrate Concentrations Using Dynamic Statistical Models+Ghosh, Sujit K.; Bhave, Prakash V.; Davis, Jerry M.; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2010::Nonseparable, stationary covariance functions for space-time data+Gneiting, T+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2002::Statistical Methods for Degradation Data With Dynamic Covariates Information andanApplication to Outdoor Weathering Data+Hong, Yili; Duan, Yuanyuan; Meeker, William Q.; et al.+TECHNOMETRICS+APR 3 2015::Fast simulation of Gaussian random fields+Lang, Annika; Potthoff, Juergen+MONTE CARLO METHODS AND APPLICATIONS+SEP 2011::Covariates and random effects in a gamma process model with application to degradation and failure+Lawless, J; Crowder, M+LIFETIME DATA ANALYSIS+SEP 2004::A framework for predicting the remaining useful life of a single unit under time-varying operating conditions+Liao, H.; Tian, Z.+IIE Transactions+2012::A spatio-temporal modeling framework for weather radar image data in tropical southeast Asia+Liu, X.; Gopal, V.; Kalagnanam, J.+Annals of Applied Statistics+2018::Condition-based maintenance for continuously monitored degrading systems with multiple failure modes+Liu, X.; Li, J.

Reliability analysis considering dynamic material local deformation,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,10.1080/00224065.2018.1436834,2018,45,1,"Material deformation is one of the major causes of material failure. In a dynamic deformation process, local deformation-defined as the displacement of various local points on a material-essentially determines the failure. Most existing studies on material reliability are conducted based on either the failure time or the degradation data. The studies do not consider the dynamic local deformation of materials and often are not efficient enough to model the failure mechanism. In this article, we develop reliability analysis by using information contained in the dynamic local deformation of materials in a tensile process. Specifically, a new multivariate general-path model is proposed to describe the deformation process. A two-stage method is developed to estimate the model parameters and overcome the computational complexity. Based on the proposed model, reliability analyses are conducted for various cases of material deformation paths. A simulation study is implemented to verify and validate the developed methods. Physical experiments are designed and conducted to demonstrate the proposed model.","advanced high-strength steel,digital image correlation,multivariate general path model,tensile process,two-stage parameter estimation,variance-based failure criterion","MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE-CHARACTERISTICS,DEGRADATION DATA,GAMMA PROCESSES,BEHAVIOR,MODEL,FAILURE,FRACTURE,LIFE,MICROSTRUCTURE,PREDICTIONS","Si, Wujun@Wayne State Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Detroit, MI 48202 USA::Yang, Qingyu@Wayne State Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Detroit, MI 48202 USA::Wu, Xin@Wayne State Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Detroit, MI 48202 USA::Chen, Yong@Univ Iowa, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Iowa City, IA USA","Si, Wujun@Wayne State University::Yang, Qingyu@Wayne State University::Wu, Xin@Wayne State University::Chen, Yong@University of Iowa",not exist,"A comprehensive model of PMOS NBTI degradation+Alam, MA; Mahapatra, S+MICROELECTRONICS RELIABILITY+JAN 2005::Standard test methods for tension testing of metallic materials+[Anonymous].+ASTM Standard E8/E8M+2013::Distribution of a sum of weighted noncentral chi-square variables+Castano-Martinez, A; Lopez-Blazquez, F+TEST+DEC 2005::Deformation, fracture, and fragmentation in brittle geologic solids+Clayton, J.

Predicting field reliability based on two-dimensional warranty data with learning effects,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,10.1080/00224065.2018.1436831,2018,26,1,"Understanding the field reliability of a sold product is crucial to both managers and engineers for monitoring product quality and improving warranty service design. When practitioners model warranty data, they it often assume that the lifetimes of products manufactured on different days is homogeneously distributed (i.e., product reliability remains the same over time). Based on a two-dimensional warranty data set collected from an automobile manufacturer, we find that the reliability of products improves over time. A log-linear regression model on the failure rate of the products is proposed by considering the usage rate and manufacturing day as covariates. The maximum likelihood approach is used to estimate the parameters. The results show the existence of learning effects in reliability in the early stage of manufacturing. A learning-curve model is then used to predict the reliability of new items produced.","accelerated failure time,field reliability,learning effects in reliability,two-dimensional warranty,warranty data","MODEL,CLAIMS,INFORMATION,REGRESSION","He, Shuguang@Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, 92 Weijin Rd, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China::Zhang, Zhaomin@Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, 92 Weijin Rd, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China::Jiang, Wei@Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China::Bian, Dejun@Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, 92 Weijin Rd, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China","He, Shuguang@Tianjin University::Zhang, Zhaomin@Tianjin University::Jiang, Wei@Shanghai Jiao Tong University::Bian, Dejun@Tianjin University",not exist,"BEHIND THE LEARNING-CURVE - A SKETCH OF THE LEARNING-PROCESS+ADLER, PS; CLARK, KB+MANAGEMENT SCIENCE+MAR 1991::Forecasting warranty claims considering dynamic over-dispersion+Akbarov, Artur; Wu, Shaomin+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS+OCT 2012::Warranty Claim Forecasting Based On Weighted Maximum Likelihood Estimation+Akbarov, Artur; Wu, Shaomin+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+OCT 2012::Lifetime Estimation Using Only Failure Information From Warranty Database+Alam, M.

Uncertainty quantification for monotone stochastic degradation models,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,10.1080/00224065.2018.1436839,2018,37,2,"Degradation data are an important source of product reliability information. Two popular stochastic models for degradation data are the Gamma process and the inverse Gaussian (IG) process, both of which possess monotone degradation paths. Although these two models have been used in numerous applications, the existing interval estimation methods are either inaccurate given a moderate sample size of the degradation data or require a significant computation time when the size of the degradation data is large. To bridge this gap, this article develops a general framework of interval estimation for the Gamma and IG processes based on the method of generalized pivotal quantities. Extensive simulations are conducted to compare the proposed methods with existing methods under moderate and large sample sizes. Degradation data from capacitors are used to illustrate the proposed methods.","coverage probability,Gamma process,generalized pivotal quantity,inverse Gaussian process","GENERALIZED CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS,INVERSE GAUSSIAN PROCESS,WIENER-PROCESSES,GAMMA PROCESSES,DISTRIBUTIONS,RELIABILITY,INFERENCE,VARIABLES,PRODUCTS,FAILURE","Chen, Piao@Inst High Performance Comp, Singapore, Singapore::Ye, Zhi-Sheng@Unknow","Chen, Piao@Agency for Science Technology & Research (ASTAR)@Institute of High Performance Computing::Ye, Zhi-Sheng@Unknow",not exist,"no title+Abramowitz, M.; Stegun, I.

Weighted EWMA charts for monitoring type I censored Weibull lifetimes,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,10.1080/00224065.2018.1436830,2018,21,0,"In this article, we first propose a control chart for monitoring the Weibull scale parameter in the context of Type I censored data, assuming that the shape parameter is fixed. The proposed chart is a Shewhart-type chart based on a likelihood ratio test (LRT) that utilizes an exponentially weighted moving average of the log-likelihood. In the literature, this type of chart is called a weighted exponentially weighted moving average (WEWMA) chart. The WEWMA chart is compared with a more standard EWMA chart and a CUSUM chart, which were recently studied as alternative solutions to the monitoring problem. Numerical results show that the WEWMA chart often performs better than these two alternatives. Sensitivity studies show that the WEWMA chart is more robust to variations in batch size and censoring time. A rust-resistant example is used to illustrate the proposed WEWMA chart. We extend the WEWMA and CUSUM charts to the context where the shape parameter also needs to be monitored. Joint charts that simultaneously look for change in either parameter are proposed.","joint monitoring,statistical process control,Weibull distribution,WEWMA chart","SAMPLE,CUSUM,DISTRIBUTIONS","Xu, Shangjie@Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Stat, Riverside, CA 92521 USA::Jeske, Daniel R.@Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Stat, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Xu, Shangjie@University of California Riverside@University of California System::Jeske, Daniel R.@University of California Riverside@University of California System",not exist,"Moving range EWMA control charts for monitoring the Weibull shape parameter+Akhundjanov, Sherzod B.; Pascual, Francis+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+JUN 13 2015::Robustness of the EWMA control chart to non-normality+Borror, CM; Montgomery, DC; Runger, GC+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1999::no title+Brockwell, P.

las/Variance Trade-Off in Estimates of a Process Parameter Lased on Temporal Data,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2017,14,0,"We recommend an approach to estimate a process performance measure (or parameter) at the present time from a stream of data where the performance may drift slowly over time. It is common practice to estimate current process performance using either present-time data only or including all historical data. When sample sizes by time period are small, an estimate based only on present-time data is imprecise. When the performance changes over time, including historical data in estimation trades more bias for less variability. We propose to regulate the bias/variance trade-off using estimating equations that down-weight past data. We derive approximations for the variance of the estimator and the distribution of a test statistic involving the estimator. The work is motivated by estimation of a customer loyalty measure where realistic data demonstrates the proposed approach.","Net Promoter Score (NPS),Process Monitoring,Weighted Estimating Equations",LIKELIHOOD,"Barfoot, Patricia L.

"Testing for Lack of Fit in Blocked, Split-Plot, and Other Multi-Stratum Designs",JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2017,22,0,"Textbooks on reponse surface methodology emphasize the importance of lack-of-fit tests when fitting response surface models and stress that, to be able to test for lack of fit, designed experiments should have replication and allow for pure-error estimation. In this paper, we show how to obtain pure-error estimates and how to carry out a lack-of-fit test when the experiment is not completely randomized, but a blocked experiment, a split-plot experiment, or any other multi-stratum experiment. Our approach to calculating pure-error estimates is based on residual maximum likelihood (REML) estimation of the variance components in a full treatment model (sometimes also referred to as a cell means model). It generalizes the approach suggested by Vining et al. (2005) in the sense that it works for a broader set of designs and for replicates other than center-point replicates. Our lack-of-fit test also generalizes the test proposed by Khuri (1992) for data from blocked experiments because it exploits replicates other than center-point replicates and works for split-plot and other multi-stratum designs as well. We provide analytical expressions for the test statistic and the corresponding degrees of freedom and demonstrate how to perform the lack-of-fit test in the SAS procedure MIXED. We re-analyze several published data sets and discover a few instances in which the usual response surface model exhibits significant lack of fit.","Kenward-Roger Degrees of Freedom,Replication,Residual Maximum Likelihood (REML),Split-Split-Plot Design,Treatment Model","RESPONSE-SURFACE DESIGNS,MODELS,INFERENCE","Goos, Peter@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Biosci Engn, Leuven, Belgium@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven Stat Res Ctr LStat, Leuven, Belgium@Univ Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium@Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, Antwerp, Belgium@Univ Antwerp, StatUa Ctr Stat, Antwerp, Belgium::Gilmour, Steven G.@Kings Coll London, Dept Math, Stat, London, England","Goos, Peter@KU Leuven@University of Antwerp::Gilmour, Steven G.@University of London@Kings College London",not exist,"Checking the Adequacy of Fit of Models from Split-Plot Designs+Almini, Ashraf A.; Kulahci, Murat; Montgomery, Douglas C.+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 2009::no title+Box, G.

Flexible Nested Latin Hypercube Designs for Computer Experiments,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2017,32,1,"Multi-level and sequential computer experiments are commonly used to study complex systems in engineering and science. Suitable designs for such experiments require nested structures. Because a nested Latin hypercube design (NLHD) (Qian (2009)) can be constructed only when the run size in each larger design is a multiple of that in a smaller one, the use of NLHDs faces some limitations in practice. In this paper, we propose a random sampling procedure for constructing flexible NLHDs, which have no such a restriction. We also develop an efficient sequential algorithm to search for the optimal NLHDs with respect to some space-filling criteria.

Constructing Tolerance Intervals for the Number of Defectives Using Both High-and Low-Resolution Data,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2017,25,0,"Defect inspection is important in many industries, such as in the manufacturing and pharmaceutical industries. Existing methods usually use either low-resolution data, which are obtained from less precise measurements, or high-resolution data, which are obtained from more precise measurements, to estimate the number of defectives in a given amount of goods produced. In this study, a novel approach is proposed that combines the two types of data to construct tolerance intervals with a desired average coverage probability. A simulation study shows that the derived tolerance intervals can lead to better performance than a tolerance interval that is constructed based on only the low-resolution data. In addition, a real-data example shows that the tolerance interval based on only the low-resolution data is more conservative than the tolerance intervals based on both high-resolution and low-resolution data.","Binomial Distribution,Confidence Interval,Coverage Probability,Data Fusion,Tolerance Interval","DISCRETE-DISTRIBUTIONS,COVERAGE PROBABILITIES,METROLOGY,VARIABLES,POISSON,DESIGN,MODEL","Wang, Hsiuying@Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Stat, Hsinchu, Taiwan::Tsung, Fugee@Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Logist Management, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Wang, Hsiuying@National Chiao Tung University::Tsung, Fugee@Hong Kong University of Science & Technology","Wang, Hsiuying@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5863-0756","A quantile-based approach to system selection+Batur, D.; Choobineh, F.+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH+MAY 1 2010::TOLERANCE INTERVALS FOR DISCRETE DISTRIBUTIONS IN EXPONENTIAL FAMILIES+Cai, Tianwen Tony; Wang, Hsiuying+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 2009::Quantile and tolerance-interval estimation in simulation+Chen, EJ; Kelton, WD+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH+JAN 16 2006::Approximate Tolerance Limits Under Log-Location-Scale Regression Models in the Presence of Censoring+Emura, Takeshi; Wang, Hsiuying+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 2010::Combining incompatible spatial data+Gotway, CA; Young, LJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2002::TOLERANCE INTERVALS FOR POISSON AND BINOMIAL VARIABLES+HAHN, GJ; CHANDRA, R+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+1981::no title+Hahn, GJ; Meeker, WQ.+Statistical intervals: a guide to practitioners+1991::ON OPTIMAL DATA-BASED BANDWIDTH SELECTION IN KERNEL DENSITY-ESTIMATION+HALL, P; SHEATHER, SJ; JONES, MC; et al.+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1991::no title+Krishnamoorthy, K.+Statistical Tolerance Regions: Theory, Applications and Computation+2009::Protein-specific Scoring Method for Ligand Discovery+Lu, I-Lin; Wang, Hsiuying+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY+NOV 2012::STATISTICAL EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGN IN PLASMA ETCH MODELING+MAY, GS; HUANG, J; SPANOS, CJ+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING+MAY 1991::Design model generation for reverse engineering using multi-sensors+Motavalli, S; Suharitdamrong, V; Alrashdan, A+IIE TRANSACTIONS+APR 1998::Second-order probability matching priors for a parametric function with application to Bayesian tolerance limits+Mukerjee, R; Reid, N+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 2001::no title+Odeh, RE; Owen, DB.+Tables for normal tolerance limits, sampling plans, and screening+1980::Bayesian hierarchica modeling for integrating low-accuracy and high-accuracy experiments+Qian, Peter Z.

A General Approach for Monitoring Serially Dependent Categorical Processes,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2017,27,1,"We consider the statistical surveillance for serially dependent categorical processes, where observations exhibit temporal dependence and have several attribute levels. In the literature, relevant methods focus on serially dependent binary data with two attribute levels and are mainly constructed from a first-order Markov chain. However, they cannot be applied to multinary data with three or more attribute levels. In addition, a Markov chain seems not to be a good choice because it cannot characterize the joint dynamics among the current observation and its past values. In this article, we adopt a multivariate categorical setting of the data and develop a general approach for monitoring serially dependent categorical processes, from binary to multinary, and from first-order dependency to higher-order dependency. Simulation results have demonstrated its robustness to various shifts in marginal probabilities and dependence structure, including autocorrelation coefficients and dependence order.","Autocorrelation Coefficient,Conditional Probability,Contingency Table,Log-Linear Model,Statistical Process Control","STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,AUTOCORRELATED PROCESSES,CONTROL CHARTS,SCHEMES","Li, Jian@Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Management, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China@Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Mfg Syst Engn, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China::Zhou, Qiang@Univ Arizona, Dept Syst & Ind Engn, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Li, Jian@Xi'an Jiaotong University::Zhou, Qiang@University of Arizona","Li, Jian@G-6844-2018","The GLRT for statistical process control of autocorrelated processes+Apley, DW; Shi, J+IIE TRANSACTIONS+SEP 1999::The autoregressive T-2 chart for monitoring univariate autocorrelated processes+Apley, DW; Tsung, F+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2002::A CUSUM scheme for autocorrelated observations+Atienza, OO; Tang, LC; Ang, BW+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 2002::no title+BEAT, U.

Monitoring the Coefficient of Variation Using a Variable Sampling Interval EWMA Chart,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2017,42,2,"In recent years, the coefficient of variation (CV) chart is receiving increasing attention in quality control. A number of studies demonstrated that adaptive charts could detect process shifts faster than traditional charts. This paper proposes an EWMA chart with variable sampling interval (VSI) to monitor the CV. Formulas for computing the performance measures of the VSI EWMA-gamma(2) chart are derived using Markov chain, where gamma(2) denotes the CV squared. Comparative studies show that the VSI EWMA-gamma(2) chart significantly outperforms other competing charts. An example using real manufacturing data shows that the VSI EWMA-gamma(2) chart performs well in applications.","Average Time to Signal,Expected Average Time to Signal,Exponentially Weighted Moving,Average Chart,Markov Chain","ESTIMATED PARAMETERS,STATISTICAL DESIGN,VARIABILITY,(X)OVER-BAR,PERFORMANCE,STRENGTH,SIZES","Yeong, W.

Optimal Experimental Design for Efficient Optical Manipulation of Magnetic Beads Seeded in a Microwell Array,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2017,20,0,"Problem: In the field of genomics, proteomics and disease diagnostics, it is of great interest to capture individual targets (e.g., cells, bacteria, exosomes) on magnetic beads and to seed them in a microwell array. Optical manipulation of the magnetic beads in the array then allows selecting the targets of interest and moving them to another location for post analysis. However, this technology is hampered by the low fraction of beads that show Brownian motion within their microwell and thus can be optically trapped and manipulated. This is due to the fact that magnetic beads seeded in a microwell array are subject to attraction forces that cause them to adhere to the microwell surfaces. The challenge is to identify buffer conditions that prevent this from happening.

Approach: We investigated five factors that were believed to influence the fraction of magnetic beads that show Brownian motion within their microwell. To this end, we used an experimental approach to maximize the fraction of beads showing Brownian motion. First, an initial D-optimal five-factor completely randomized design was created, including specific control treatments, for the estimation of a response surface model including a two-level and a six-level categorical factor (bead type and type of surfactant). Subsequently, two I-optimal follow-up experiments were conducted to examine the effectiveness of higher levels for one of the quantitative factors under investigation.

Results: The initial D-optimal five-factor design indicated one insignificant quantitative factor. The remaining four factors all had a significant main effect. In addition, there were three significant interaction effects and one significant quadratic effect. The analysis of the data from the initial experimental design also revealed a strongly positive effect for two of the six surfactants. In the follow-up experiment, these two surfactants turned out to produce even larger predicted responses at higher concentrations.","Brownian Motion,Control Treatment,D-Optimal Design,I-Optimal Design,Microwell Array,Optimal Experimental Design,Six-Level Categorical Factor","RESPONSE-SURFACE DESIGNS,BLOCKING,ASSAY","Decrop, D.@Katholieke Univ Leuven, MeBioS, Willem de Croylaan 42, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium::Lammertyn, J.@Katholieke Univ Leuven, MeBioS, Willem de Croylaan 42, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium::Goos, P.@Katholieke Univ Leuven, MeBioS, Kasteelpk Arenberg 30, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium@Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, Stadscampus,Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium@Univ Antwerp, StatUa Ctr Stat, Stadscampus,Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium","Decrop, D.@KU Leuven::Lammertyn, J.@KU Leuven::Goos, P.@KU Leuven@University of Antwerp",not exist,"no title+Atkinson, A.; Donev, A.; Tobias, R.+Optimum Experimental Designs, with SAS+2007::THE CONSTRUCTION OF EXACT D-OPTIMUM EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGNS WITH APPLICATION TO BLOCKING RESPONSE-SURFACE DESIGNS+ATKINSON, AC; DONEV, AN+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1989::COMPUTER-AIDED BLOCKING OF FACTORIAL AND RESPONSE-SURFACE DESIGNS+COOK, RD; NACHTSHEIM, CJ+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 1989::Blocking response surface designs+Goos, P.; Donev, A.

Inference on an Adaptive Accelerated Life Test with Application to Smart-Grid Data-Acquisition-Devices,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2017,24,1,"An accelerated life test (ALT) is often well planned to yield the most statistical information given limited test resources. Nevertheless, ALT planning requires rough estimates of the model parameters as an input, called planning values. The discrepancy between the planning values and the true values may result in insufficient or even no failures at the low-stress level, making the subsequent data analysis difficult. Motivated by the need in the ALTs of data acquisition devices used in smart grids, an adaptive ALT scheme is proposed. The key idea is based on the observation that, when the product reliability is underestimated during the ALT design phase, it is unlikely to observe failures at the early stage of the test. Therefore, the low-stress level should be elevated to protect against insufficient failures. Under this adaptive ALT framework, order statistics techniques are used to derive the likelihood function by assuming a general log location-scale distribution for the product lifetime.

Multi-Scale Diagnosis of Spatial Point Interaction Via Decomposition of the K Function-Based T-2 Statistic,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2017,28,0,"Data in the form of spatial point distribution are commonly encountered in manufacturing processes such as nanoparticles in composite materials. By analyzing their distributional characteristics which are often related to product quality, we can monitor and diagnose the fabrication processes. Based on modeling the K function of point patterns using a Gaussian process, this paper proposes diagnosing point patterns through decomposition of the K function-based T-2 statistic. The decomposition provides a novel way for independently analyzing point interactions at multiple spatial scales, which is particularly useful for fault diagnosis when the process is out of control. Effectiveness of the proposed method has been verified through several simulated examples and real data.","Fault Diagnosis,Hotelling's T-2 Control Chart,MYT Decomposition,Spatial Point Pattern,The K Function","NANOCOMPOSITES,INTERPARTICLE,PERFORMANCE","Huang, Xiaohu@City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Syst Engn & Engn Management, 83 Tat Chee Ave, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China::Xu, Jiakun@City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Syst Engn & Engn Management, 83 Tat Chee Ave, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China::Zhou, Qiang@Univ Arizona, Dept Syst & Ind Engn, 1127 E James E Rogers Way, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Huang, Xiaohu@City University of Hong Kong::Xu, Jiakun@City University of Hong Kong::Zhou, Qiang@University of Arizona",not exist,"Reconstruction of random microstructures - a stochastic optimization problem+Bochenek, B; Pyrz, R+COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE+SEP 2004::Extraordinary strengthening effect of carbon nanotubes in metal-matrix nanocomposites processed by molecular-level mixing+Cha, SI; Kim, KT; Arshad, SN; et al.+ADVANCED MATERIALS+JUN 6 2005::no title+Cressie, N.+Statistics for Spatial Data+1993::no title+Diggle, P.J.+Statistical Analysis of Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Point Patterns+2013::no title+Diggle, P.J.+Statistical Analysis of Spatial Point Patterns+1983::Particle Arrangement Characterization by the Pair Correlation Function+GACSI, Z.; KOVACS, J.; PIECZONKA, T.+Powder Metallurgy Progress+2003::Particle distribution in cast metal matrix composites - Part I+Hashim, J; Looney, L; Hashmi, MSJ+JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY+APR 30 2002::Monitoring Spatial Uniformity of Particle Distributions in Manufacturing Processes Using the K Function+HUANG, X.; ZHOU, Q.; ZENG, L.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Li, X</span>.+IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering+2015::no title+Illian, J; Penttinen, A; Stoyan, H<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Stoyan, D</span>.+Statistical analysis and modelling of spatial point patterns+2008::no title+Jackson, J.+A user's guide to principal components+2005::NOTE ON STRAUSSS MODEL FOR CLUSTERING+KELLY, FP; RIPLEY, BD+BIOMETRIKA+1976::Causation-based T-2 decomposition for Multivariate process monitoring and diagnosis+Li, Jing; Jin, Jionghua; Shi, Jianjun+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2008::METHODS FOR ANALYZING SPATIAL PROCESSES OF SEVERAL TYPES OF POINTS+LOTWICK, HW; SILVERMAN, BW+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1982::Computational study of structure and performance of four constituents HMX-based composite material+Ma, Xiufang; Zhao, Feng; Ji, Guangfu; et al.+JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE-THEOCHEM+FEB 28 2008::Control of the interparticle spacing in gold nanoparticle superlattices+Martin, JE; Wilcoxon, JP; Odinek, J; et al.+JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B+OCT 12 2000::A practical approach for interpreting multivariate T-2 control chart signals+Mason, RL; Tracy, ND; Young, JC+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 1997::DECOMPOSITION OF T-2 FOR MULTIVARIATE CONTROL CHART INTERPRETATION+MASON, RL; TRACY, ND; YOUNG, JC+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 1995::no title+Montgomery, D.

Selecting an Informative/Discriminating Multivariate Response for Inverse Prediction,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2017,23,1,"Inverse prediction is important in a variety of scientific and engineering applications, such as to predict properties/characteristics of an object by using multiple measurements obtained from it. Inverse prediction can be accomplished by inverting parameterized forward models that relate the measurements (responses) to the properties/characteristics of interest. Sometimes forward models are computational/science based; but often, forward models are empirically based response surface models, obtained by using the results of controlled experimentation. For empirical models, it is important that the experiments provide a sound basis to develop accurate forward models in terms of the properties/characteristics (factors). While nature dictates the causal relationships between factors and responses, experimenters can control the complexity, accuracy, and precision of forward models constructed via selection of factors, factor levels, and the set of trials that are performed. Recognition of the uncertainty in the estimated forward models leads to an errors-in-variables approach for inverse prediction. The forward models (estimated by experiments or science based) can also be used to analyze how well candidate responses complement one another for inverse prediction over the range of the factor space of interest. One may find that some responses are complementary, redundant, or noninformative. Simple analysis and examples illustrate how an informative and discriminating subset of responses could be selected among candidates in cases where the number of responses that can be acquired during inverse prediction is limited by difficulty, expense, and/or availability of material.","Calibration,Errors in Variables,Glass Composition,Nuclear Forensics,Total Least Squares","CALIBRATION,DESIGN","Thomas, Edward V.@Sandia Natl Labs, POB 5800, Albuquerque, NM 87185 USA::Lewis, John R.@Sandia Natl Labs, POB 5800, Albuquerque, NM 87185 USA::Anderson-Cook, Christine M.@Los Alamos Natl Lab, Stat Sci Grp, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA::Burr, Tom@Los Alamos Natl Lab, Stat Sci Grp, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA@IAEA, Vienna, Austria::Hamada, Michael S.@Los Alamos Natl Lab, Stat Sci Grp, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA","Thomas, Edward V.@United States Department of Energy (DOE)@Sandia National Laboratory::Lewis, John R.@United States Department of Energy (DOE)@Sandia National Laboratory::Anderson-Cook, Christine M.@Los Alamos National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)::Burr, Tom@Los Alamos National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)@International Atomic Energy Agency::Hamada, Michael S.@Los Alamos National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)","Lewis, John@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7102-8217","Design of experiments and data analysis challenges in calibration for forensics applications+Anderson-Cook, Christine; Burr, Tom; Hamada, Michael S.; et al.+CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS+DEC 15 2015::Response surface design evaluation and comparison+Anderson-Cook, Christine M.; Borror, Connie M.; Montgomery, Douglas C.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+FEB 1 2009::Statistical analysis for nuclear forensics experiments+Anderson-Cook, Christine M.; Burr, Tom; Hamada, M.

Using Definitive Screening Designs to Identify Active First- and Second-Order Factor Effects,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2017,35,1,"Definitive screening designs (DSDs) were recently introduced by Jones and Nachtsheim (2011b). The use of three-level factors and the desirable aliasing structure of the DSDs make them potentially suitable for identifying main effects and second-order terms in one stage of experimentation. However, as the number of active effects approaches the number of runs, the performance of standard model-selection routines will inevitably degrade. In this paper, we characterize the ability of DSDs to correctly identify first and second-order model terms as a function of the level of sparsity, the number of factors in the design, the signal-to-noise ratio, the model type (unrestricted or following strong heredity), the model-selection technique, and the number of augmented runs. We find that minimum-run-size DSDs can be used to identify active terms with high probability as long as the number of effects is less than or equal to about half the number of runs and the signal-to-noise ratios for the active effects are above about 2.0. We also find that if minimum-run-size designs are augmented with four or more runs, the number of model terms that can be identified with high probability increases substantially. Among the model-selection methods investigated, we found that both Lasso and the Gauss-Dantzig selector (both based on AlCc) can be used to effectively identify active model terms in the presence of unrestricted models. For models following strong heredity, the SHIM method developed by Choi et al. (2010) was the best among methods tested that were designed for the strong-heredity case.","Dantzig Selector,Foldover Design,Lasso,Model Selection,Supersaturated Design","VARIABLE-SELECTION APPROACH,SUPERSATURATED DESIGNS,MODEL SELECTION,REGRESSION,CONSTRUCTION,STRATEGY","Errore, Anna@Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA@Univ Minnesota, Supply Chain & Operat Dept, Minneapolis, MN USA::Jones, Bradley@SAS, JMP Div, Cary, NC USA::Li, William@Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA@Univ Minnesota, Supply Chain & Operat Dept, Business Teaching & Res, Minneapolis, MN USA::Nachtsheim, Christopher J.@Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA@Univ Minnesota, Supply Chain & Operat Dept, Operat Management, Minneapolis, MN USA","Errore, Anna@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities::Jones, Bradley@Unknow::Li, William@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities::Nachtsheim, Christopher J.@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities",not exist,"Information Theory and an Extension of the Maximum Likelihood Principle+Akaike, Hirotogu.+Selected Papers of Hirotugu Akaike+1998::A two-stage Bayesian model selection strategy for supersaturated designs+Beattie, SD; Fong, DKH; Lin, DKJ+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 2002::AN ANALYSIS FOR UNREPLICATED FRACTIONAL FACTORIALS+BOX, GEP; MEYER, RD+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1986::no title+Burnham, KP; Anderson, DR.+Model selection and multimodel inference: a practical information-theoretic approach+2002::no title+CANDES E+THE ANNALS OF STATIS+2007::A Bayesian variable-selection approach for analyzing designed experiments with complex aliasing+Chipman, H; Hamada, M; Wu, CFJ+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1997::Variable Selection With the Strong Heredity Constraint and Its Oracle Property+Choi, Nam Hee; Li, William; Zhu, Ji+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2010::Screening Strategies in the Presence of Interactions+Draguljic, Danel; Woods, David C.; Dean, Angela M.; et al.+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 2014::Least angle regression+Efron, B; Hastie, T; Johnstone, I; et al.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2004::Benefits and Fast Construction of Efficient Two-Level Foldover Designs+Errore, Anna; Jones, Bradley; Li, William; et al.+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 2017::ANALYSIS OF DESIGNED EXPERIMENTS WITH COMPLEX ALIASING+HAMADA, M; WU, CFJ+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1992::Analysis of supersaturated designs+Holcomb, DR; Montgomery, DC; Carlyle, WM+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2003::REGRESSION AND TIME-SERIES MODEL SELECTION IN SMALL SAMPLES+HURVICH, CM; TSAI, CL+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1989::Definitive Screening Designs with Added Two-Level Categorical Factors+Jones, Bradley; Nachtsheim, Christopher J.+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 2013::A Class of Three-Level Designs for Definitive Screening in the Presence of Second-Order Effects+Jones, Bradley; Nachtsheim, Christopher J.+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2011::Blocking Schemes for Definitive Screening Designs+Jones, Bradley; Nachtsheim, Christopher J.+TECHNOMETRICS+JAN 2 2016::Efficient Designs With Minimal Aliasing+Jones, Bradley; Nachtsheim, Christopher J.+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 2011::Analysis methods for supersaturated design: some comparisons+Li, R.; Lin, D.

A Criterion for Constructing Powerful Supersaturated Designs When Effect Directions Are Known,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2017,23,0,"As a criterion for selecting supersaturated designs, we suggest minimizing the variance of the pairwise inner products of the design-matrix columns, subject to a constraint on the E(s(2))-efficiency as well as a requirement that the average correlation between the columns is positive. We call these designs constrained positive Var(s)-optimal and argue that, if the direction of the effects can be specified in advance, these designs are more powerful to detect active effects than other supersaturated designs while not substantially increasing Type I error rates. These designs are constructed algorithmically, using a coordinate-exchange algorithm that exploits the structure of the criterion to provide computational advantages.

Moreover, because the existing tr-chart based on probability limits is biased, we provide a procedure for designing a t(r)-chart, with or without runs rules, that is unbiased. The performance of several t(r)-charts with runs rules is investigated, whereas comparisons with EWMA and CUSUM charts are also given.

Two-Level Augmented Definitive Screening Designs,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2017,6,0,"Definitive screening designs (DSDs) constitute a well-known class of screening designs for three-level factors. DSDs are comprised of orthogonal main effects plans for which main effects estimates are statistically independent of estimates of two-factor interactions. Jones and Nachtsheim (2013) proposed two methods for augmenting DSDs with two-level categorical factors, namely the DSD-augment and the ORTH-augment approaches. However, these two versions produce distinct features that are not sufficiently flexible to accommodate versatile performance preferences in practice. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the augmented designs with DSD structures and show how to construct compromise designs that share the desirable traits of both DSD-augment and ORTH-augment designs. In addition to the DSD-augment and ORTH-augment designs, we suggest routine consideration of nondominated compromise designs as described in the paper. Additionally, we provide some theoretical properties of randomly assigned augmented DSDs.","Conference Matrix,Correlation Cell Plot,D-s-Optimality,Fold-Over Design,Pareto Front",,"Nachtsheim, Abigael C.@Arizona State Univ, Sch Math & Stat Sci, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA::Shen, Weijie@Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA@Google Inc, Mountain View, CA USA::Lin, Dennis K.

Multivariate Ordinal Categorical Process Control Based on Log-Linear Modeling,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2017,29,0,"In many applications, the quality of products or services tends to be measured by multiple categorical characteristics, each of which is classified into attribute levels such as good, marginal, and bad. Here there is usually natural order among these attribute levels. However, traditional monitoring techniques ignore such order among them. By assuming that each ordinal categorical quality characteristic is determined by a latent continuous variable, this paper incorporates the ordinal information into an extended log-linear model and proposes a multivariate ordinal categorical control chart based on a generalized likelihood-ratio test. The proposed chart is efficient in detecting location shifts and dependence shifts in the corresponding latent continuous variables of ordinal categorical characteristics based on merely the attribute-level counts of the ordinal characteristics.","Contingency Table,Dependence Shift,Latent Variable,Location Shift,Statistical Process Control","EWMA CONTROL CHART,STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,ATTRIBUTE PROCESSES,CONTROL SCHEMES","Wang, Junjie@Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Management, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China@City Univ Hong Kong, Shenzhen Res Inst, Dept Syst Engn & Engn Management, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China::Li, Jian@Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Management, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China@Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Mfg Syst Engn, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China::Su, Qin@Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Management, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China@Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Mfg Syst Engn, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Wang, Junjie@City University of Hong Kong@Xi'an Jiaotong University::Li, Jian@Xi'an Jiaotong University::Su, Qin@Xi'an Jiaotong University","Li, Jian@G-6844-2018::WANG, Junjie@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8451-7765","no title+Agresti, A.+Analysis of Ordinal Categorical Data+2010::no title+Anderson, T.

Nonparametric Change-Point Detection for Profiles with Binary Data,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2017,31,0,"Statistical process control (SPC) techniques for monitoring and diagnosing profiles have been proven to be important in many industrial applications. Profiles describe the relationship between the response variable and one or more explanatory variables. In some processes, the response variable of interest in profiles is binary, not numerical. The SPC problem for profiles with binary response data remains particularly challenging. Under such a premise, this article proposes a novel phase I scheme to detect the change-point in the reference profile dataset. The proposed method integrates change-point algorithm with the generalized likelihood ratio based on nonparametric regression, which could not only handle the generalized linear or nonlinear profiles, but also detect any types of changes in profiles. Numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the detection effectiveness and the diagnostic accuracy of the proposed scheme. Finally, a real example is used to illustrate the implementation of the proposed change-point detection scheme.","Binary Response Data,Local Linear Kernel Smoothing,Likelihood Ratio,Phase I","PHASE-I ANALYSIS,LINEAR PROFILES,NONLINEAR PROFILES,CONTROL CHART,MIXED MODELS,REGRESSION","Shang, Yanfen@Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Dept Ind Engn, Tianjin, Peoples R China::Wand, Zhiqiong@Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin, Peoples R China::He, Zhen@Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Dept Ind Engn, Tianjin, Peoples R China::He, Shuguang@Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin, Peoples R China","Shang, Yanfen@Tianjin University::Wand, Zhiqiong@Tianjin University::He, Zhen@Tianjin University::He, Shuguang@Tianjin University",not exist,"Phase I monitoring of generalized linear model-based regression profiles+Amiri, Amirhossein; Koosha, Mehdi; Azhdari, Armaghan; et al.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+SEP 22 2015::Statistical Process Monitoring of Nonlinear Profiles Using Wavelets+Chicken, Eric; Pignatiello, Joseph, Jr.; Simpson, James R.+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 2009::Phase I analysis for monitoring nonlinear profiles in manufacturing processes+Ding, Yu; Zeng, Li; Zhou, Shiyu+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 2006::no title+Fan, J.; Gijbels, I.+Local Polynomial Modeling and Its Application+1996::Generalized likelihood ratio statistics and Wilks phenomenon+Fan, JQ; Zhang, CM; Zhang, J+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 2001::LOCAL POLYNOMIAL KERNEL REGRESSION FOR GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS AND QUASI-LIKELIHOOD FUNCTIONS+FAN, JQ; HECKMAN, NE; WAND, MP+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1995::no title+Hart, J.

Bayesian Monitoring of Times Between Events: The Shewhart t(r)-Chart,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2017,40,0,"The traditional (frequentist) t(r)-chart is a Shewhart-type chart useful for monitoring times between events (interarrival times) following an exponential distribution. This problem often arises in high-yield processes where the defect rate is low and hence the conventional attribute charts such as the c-chart and the u-chart are often ineffective. We consider this problem under the Bayesian framework and propose a Bayesian t(r)-chart when the exponential rate parameter is unknown. The Bayesian t(r)-chart is a Shewhart-type chart that incorporates parameter uncertainty via a prior and a posterior distribution, unlike the traditional tr-chart. The control limits are constructed from the predictive distribution of a plotting statistic. The performance of the proposed chart is evaluated and comparisons are made with the traditional t(r)-chart. The Bayesian chart is seen to be advantageous in certain situations. An illustrative example is given and a summary and conclusions are offered.","Bayesian and Frequentist Control Charts,Exponential Distribution,Performance Metrics,Predictive Distribution,Prior and Posterior Distributions","X-CONTROL CHARTS,ESTIMATED PARAMETERS,CONTROL LIMITS,CUSUM,(X)OVER-BAR,DESIGN,DISTRIBUTIONS,PERFORMANCE,SELECTION,MODEL","Kumar, Nirpeksh@Univ Pretoria, Dept Stat, Pretoria, South Africa@Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Stat, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India::Chakraborti, Subha@Univ Alabama, Dept Informat Syst Stat & Management Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL USA@Univ Pretoria, Dept Informat Syst Stat & Management Sci, Pretoria, South Africa","Kumar, Nirpeksh@University of Pretoria@Banaras Hindu University::Chakraborti, Subha@University of Pretoria@University of Alabama Tuscaloosa@University of Alabama System",not exist,"An economic <i>X</i>-chart approach to the joint control of the means of independent quality characteristics+Arnold, B.F.+ZOR, Methods and Models of Operations Research+1990::CRITERIA FOR BAYESIAN MODEL CHOICE WITH APPLICATION TO VARIABLE SELECTION+Bayarri, M.

Guaranteed In-Control Performance for the Shewhart X and (X)over-bar Control Charts,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2017,27,8,"When in-control parameters are unknown, they have to be estimated using a reference sample. Due to the use of different reference samples in phase I, the control chart performance in phase II will vary across practitioners. This variation is especially large for small sample sizes. To prevent low in-control average run lengths, new corrections for Shewhart control charts are proposed that guarantee a minimum in-control performance with a specified probability. However, a minimum in-control performance guarantee generally lowers the out-of-control performance. To balance the tradeoff between in-control and out-of control performance, the minimum performance threshold and specified probability can be adjusted as desired. The corrections are given in a closed form so that the bootstrap method, which has recently been suggested, is no longer required. The performance of our proposed correction is illustrated by simulating some practical situations. Furthermore, a comparison is made with tolerance intervals and self-starting control charts.","Average Run Length,Conditional Distribution,Parameter Estimation,Self-Starting Control Charts,Statistical Process Control,Tolerance Intervals","2-SIDED TOLERANCE LIMITS,ESTIMATED PARAMETERS,NORMAL-POPULATIONS,CHI-SQUARE","Goedhart, Rob@Univ Amsterdam, Dept Operat Management, Fac Econ & Business, Plantage Muidergracht 12, NL-1018 TV Amsterdam, Netherlands@Univ Amsterdam, IBIS UvA, Plantage Muidergracht 12, NL-1018 TV Amsterdam, Netherlands::Schoonhoven, Marit@Univ Amsterdam, Dept Operat Management, Fac Econ & Business, Plantage Muidergracht 12, NL-1018 TV Amsterdam, Netherlands@Univ Amsterdam, IBIS UvA, Plantage Muidergracht 12, NL-1018 TV Amsterdam, Netherlands::Does, Ronald J.

Estimating a Service-Life Distribution Based on Production Counts and a Failure Database,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2017,7,1,"Problem: A manufacturer wanted to compare the service-life distributions of two similar products. These concern product lifetimes after installation (not manufacture). For each product, there were available production counts and an imperfect database providing information on failing units. In the real case, these units were expensive repairable units warrantied against repairs. Failure (of interest here) was relatively rare and driven by a different mode/mechanism than ordinary repair events (not of interest here).

Approach: Data models for the service life based on a standard parametric lifetime distribution and a related limited failure population were developed. These models were used to develop expressions for the likelihood of the available data that properly accounts for information missing in the failure database.

Results: A Bayesian approach was employed to obtain estimates of model parameters (with associated uncertainty) in order to investigate characteristics of the service-life distribution. Custom software was developed and is included as Supplemental Material to this case study. One part of a responsible approach to the original case was a simulation experiment used to validate the correctness of the software and the behavior of the statistical methodology before using its results in the application, and an example of such an experiment is included here.

Because of confidentiality issues that prevent use of the original data, simulated data with characteristics like the manufacturer's proprietary data are used to illustrate some aspects of our real analyses. We note also that, although this case focuses on rare and complete product failure, the statistical methodology provided is directly applicable to more standard warranty data problems involving typically much larger warranty databases where entries are warranty claims (often for repairs) rather than reports of complete failures.","Dynamic Parameters,Failure Date,Installation Date,Lifetime Distribution,Limited Failure Population,Log-Likelihood,Manufacture Date,Markov Chain Monte Carlo,Simulation Experiment,Warranty Period",,"Ryan, Kenneth J.@West Virginia Univ, Stat, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA::Hamada, Michael S.@Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA::Vardeman, Stephen B.@Iowa State Univ, Stat & Ind Engn, Ames, IA 50011 USA","Ryan, Kenneth J.@West Virginia University::Hamada, Michael S.@Los Alamos National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)::Vardeman, Stephen B.@Iowa State University",not exist,"no title+Gelman,, A.; Carlin,, J.; Stern,, H.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Dunson,, D.; Vehtari,, A.; Rubin,, D</span>.+Bayesian data analysis+2013::Automatic Step Size Selection in Random Walk Metropolis Algorithms+GRAVES, T.

CME Analysis: A New Method for Unraveling Aliased Effects in Two-Level Fractional Factorial Experiments,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,2017,14,4,"Ever since the founding work by Finney (1945), it has been widely known and accepted that aliased effects in two-level regular designs cannot be ""de- aliased"" without adding more runs. A result by Wu in his 2011 Fisher Lecture showed that aliased effects can sometimes be ""de-aliased"" using a new framework based on the concept of conditional main effects (CMEs). This idea is further developed in this paper into a methodology that can be readily used. Some key properties are derived that govern the relationships among CMEs or between them and related effects. As a consequence, some rules for data analysis are developed. Based on these rules, a new CME-based methodology is proposed. Three real examples are used to illustrate the methodology. The CME analysis can often lead to models with fewer effect terms and smaller p values for the selected effects. Moreover, the selected CME effects are often more interpretable.","Conditional Main Effect,Fractional Factorial Design,Orthogonal Modeling",,"Su, Heng@Wells Fargo, 401 S Tryon St, Charlotte, NC 28202 USA::Wu, C.

Batch Sequential Minimum Energy Design with Design-Region Adaptation,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,10.1080/00224065.2017.11918182,2017,24,0,"Experiments related to nanofabrication often face challenges of resource-limited experimental budgets, highly demanding tolerance requirements, and complicated response surfaces. Therefore, wisely selecting design points is crucial in order to minimize the expense of resources while at the same time ensuring that enough information is gained to accurately address the experimental goals. In this paper, an efficient batch-sequential design methodology is proposed for optimizing high-cost, low-resource experiments with complicated response surfaces. Through the sequential learning of the unknown response surface, the proposed method sequentially narrows down the design space to more important subregions and selects a batch of design points in the reduced design region. The proposed method balances the space filling of the design region and the search for the optimal operating condition. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on a nanowire synthesis system as well as on an optimization test function.","Batch Sequential Design,Combined Design Criteria,Experiments,Optimization,Space-Filling Design","LEVEL COMBINATIONS,GENETIC ALGORITHMS,OPTIMIZATION,NANOTECHNOLOGY,ELIMINATION,SELC","Kim, Heeyoung@Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Daejeon, South Korea::Vastola, Justin T.@Revenue Analyt Inc, Atlanta, GA USA::Kim, Sungil@Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Management Engn, Ulsan, South Korea::Lu, Jye-Chyi@Georgia Inst Technol, H Milton Stewart Sch Ind & Syst Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA::Grover, Martha A.@Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Chem & Biomol Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Kim, Heeyoung@Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST)::Vastola, Justin T.@Unknow::Kim, Sungil@Ulsan National Institute of Science & Technology::Lu, Jye-Chyi@Georgia Institute of Technology@University System of Georgia::Grover, Martha A.@Georgia Institute of Technology@University System of Georgia","Kim, Heeyoung@O-1769-2013","Nanotechnology, Big Things from a Tiny World: A Review+Bhattacharyya, D.; Singh, S.; Satnalika, N.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Khandelwal, A.; Jeon, S. - H</span>.+Nanotechnology+2009::no title+Box, G.

In this paper, we incorporate pure error, along with traditional design criteria, using Pareto optimization to identify a collection of optimal designs. This strategy demonstrates the trade-offs between these conflicting objectives without having to resort to weighted combinations of the criteria.

Shelf-Life Prediction of Nano-Sol via pH Acceleration,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,10.1080/00224065.2017.11918184,2017,16,0,"This article addresses the shelf-life prediction of a nano-sol product. From a preliminary analysis of the dataset in a real example, we found pH is an appropriate accelerating variable for the purpose of predicting the shelf-life of a nano-sol product. In addition, we found that the histogram-valued frequency plots of the particle-size distribution of a nano-sol can be reasonably decomposed into a mixture of two normal distributions. Therefore, a pH accelerated degradation model is proposed to characterize the time evolution of the particle size distributions. By using an expectation/conditional maximization algorithm, we analytically obtain the shelf-life prediction of nano-sol (under the use condition) and its corresponding 95% confidence interval. The main contribution of this study is that the shelf-life prediction of the nano-sol products can be statistically achieved via the pH acceleration.","Expectation/Conditional Maximization (ECM) Algorithm,Mixture of Two Normal Distributions,Nano-Sol,pH Acceleration Model,Shelf-Life Prediction","NANOPARTICLE,AGGREGATION,DISPERSION,STABILITY,SYSTEMS,CMP","Yao, Yu-Cheng@Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan@Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Inst Stat, Hsinchu, Taiwan::Tseng, Sheng-Tsaing@Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Inst Stat, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan::Wong, David Shan Hill@Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan","Yao, Yu-Cheng@National Tsing Hua University::Tseng, Sheng-Tsaing@National Tsing Hua University::Wong, David Shan Hill@National Tsing Hua University",not exist,"Role of interaction forces in controlling the stability and polishing performance of CMP slurries+Basim, GB; Vakarelski, IU; Moudgil, BM+JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE+JUL 15 2003::Quantitative characterization and modeling strategy of nanoparticle dispersion in polymer composites+Chang, Chia-Jung; Xu, Lijuan; Huang, Qiang; et al.+IIE TRANSACTIONS+2012::Nanoparticles and their structures: the next generation+Friedlander, S.

For each problem discussed in this study, the inferential procedure based on the generalized fiducial method is outlined and a simulation is conducted to assess its performance.

ARL Numerics for MEWMA Charts,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,10.1080/00224065.2017.11918186,2017,33,0,The FORTRAN code in Bodden and Rigdon (1999) for the in-control average run length (ARL) of multivariate exponentially weighted moving average charts (MEWMA) became quite popular and is widely used in statistical software systems such as MINITAB and STATISTICA. We find that the algorithms' accuracy is poor for low-dimensional processes. The Markov chain approximation described in Runger and Prabhu (1996) is not able to resolve the issue. The same holds for the calculation of the out-of-control ARL as proposed in Ridgon (1995b). We present two concepts that achieve higher accuracy for all dimensions. The competing numerical procedures are implemented in the R package spc.,"Collocation,Fredholm Integral Equation of the Second Kind,Markov Chain Approximation,Multivariate Statistical Process Control,Nystrom Method,Software implementation","AVERAGE CONTROL CHART,EWMA CONTROL CHART,INTEGRAL-EQUATION,RUN-LENGTH,COVARIANCE-MATRIX,PROGRAM","Knoth, Sven@Helmut Schmidt Univ, Univ Fed Armed Forces Hamburg, Dept Math & Stat, POB 700822, D-22008 Hamburg, Germany","Knoth, Sven@Unknow",not exist,"A program for approximating the in-control ARL for the MEWMA chart+Bodden, KM; Rigdon, SE+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 1999::Reconciling the integral equation and Markov chain approaches for computing EWMA average run lengths+Calzada, ME; Scariano, SM+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+2003::Evaluation of the run-length distribution for a combined Shewhart-EWMA control chart+Capizzi, Giovanna; Masarotto, Guido+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+JAN 2010::A SIMPLE METHOD FOR STUDYING RUN-LENGTH DISTRIBUTIONS OF EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE CHARTS+CROWDER, SV+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1987::Joint EWMA charts for multivariate process control: Markov chain and optimal design+Epprecht, Eugenio K.; de Luna, Marco A.; Aparisi, Francisco+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH+2011::Algorithm AS 258: Average run lengths for cumulative sum schemes+Fellner, W.

A Bayesian Approach to Diagnostics for Multivariate Control Charts,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2016,28,1,"When a multivariate control chart raises an out-of-control signal, several diagnostic questions arise. When did the change occur? Which components or quality characteristics changed? For those components for which the mean shifted, what are the new values for the mean? While methods exist for addressing these questions individually, we present a Bayesian approach that addresses all three questions in a single model. We employ Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods in a Bayesian analysis that can be used in a unified approach to the diagnostics questions for multivariate charts. We demonstrate how a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) approach can be used to infer (1) the change point, (2) the change model (i.e., which components changed), and (3) post-change estimates of the mean.","Markov Chain Monte Carlo,Multivariate Control Chart,Posterior Distribution,Transdimensional","CHANGE-POINT DETECTION,CHANGEPOINT PROBLEMS,COVARIANCE-MATRIX,INFERENCE,SEQUENCE,TIME,T-2","Steward, Robert M.@Natl Geospatial Intelligence Agcy, St Louis, MO 63118 USA::Rigdon, Steven E.@St Louis Univ, Dept Biostat, St Louis, MO 63103 USA::Pan, Rong@Arizona State Univ, Sch Comp Informat & Decis Syst Engn, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA","Steward, Robert M.@Unknow::Rigdon, Steven E.@Saint Louis University::Pan, Rong@Arizona State University",not exist,"Techniques to interpret T-2 control chart signals+Aparisi, F; Avendano, G; Sanz, J+IIE TRANSACTIONS+AUG 2006::A BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS FOR CHANGE POINT PROBLEMS+BARRY, D; HARTIGAN, JA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::HIERARCHICAL BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS OF CHANGEPOINT PROBLEMS+CARLIN, BP; GELFAND, AE; SMITH, AFM+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+1992::Approaches for statistical inference+Carlin, Bradley P.; Louis, Thomas A.+BAYESIAN METHODS FOR DATA ANALYSIS, THIRD EDITION+2009::no title+Chen, J; Gupta, AK.+Parametric Statistical Change Point Analysis: With Applications to Genetics, Medicine, and Finance+2012::Multiple change-point detection of multivariate mean vectors with the Bayesian approach+Cheon, Sooyoung; Kim, Jaehee+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+FEB 1 2010::ESTIMATING CURRENT MEAN OF NORMAL-DISTRIBUTION WHICH IS SUBJECTED TO CHANGES IN TIME+CHERNOFF, H; ZACKS, S+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1964::The practical implementation of Bayesian model selection+Chipman, H.; George, E.

Multiple Objective Optimization in Reliability Demonstration Tests,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2016,13,0,"Reliability demonstration tests are usually performed in product design or validation processes to demonstrate whether a product meets specified requirements on reliability. For binomial demonstration tests, the zero-failure test has been most commonly used due to its simplicity and use of minimum sample size to achieve an acceptable consumer's risk level. However, this test can often result in unacceptably high risk for producers as well as a low probability of passing the test even when the product has good reliability. This paper explicitly explores the interrelationship between multiple objectives that are commonly of interest when planning a demonstration test and proposes structured decision-making procedures using a Pareto front approach for selecting an optimal test plan based on simultaneously balancing multiple criteria. Different strategies are suggested for scenarios with different user priorities and graphical tools are developed to help quantify the trade-offs between choices and to facilitate informed decision making. Potential impacts of some subjective user inputs on the final decision are studied to offer insights and useful guidance for general applications.","Bayesian Analysis,Consumer's Risk,Decision Making,Pareto Front,Producer's Risk,Trade-Offs",PARETO-OPTIMIZATION,"Lu, Lu@Univ S Florida, Dept Math & Stat, Tampa, FL 33620 USA::Li, Mingyang@Univ S Florida, Dept Ind & Management Syst Engn, Tampa, FL 33620 USA::Anderson-Cook, Christine M.@Los Alamos Natl Lab, Stat Sci Grp, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA","Lu, Lu@University of South Florida@State University System of Florida::Li, Mingyang@University of South Florida@State University System of Florida::Anderson-Cook, Christine M.@Los Alamos National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)",not exist,"Much-Needed Structure: A New 5-Step Decision-Making Process Helps You Evaluate, Balance Competing Objectives+Anderson-Cook, C.

Identifying the Structure of the Experimental Design,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2016,28,1,"In many areas of scientific research, complex experimental designs are now routinely employed. The statistical analysis of data generated when using these designs may be carried out by a statistician; however, modern statistical software packages allow such analyses to be performed by non-statisticians. For the non statistician, failing to correctly identify the structure of the experimental design can lead to incorrect model selection and misleading inferences. A procedure, which does not require expert statistical knowledge, is described that focuses the non-statistician's attention on the relationship between the experimental material and design, identifies the underlying structure of the selected design, and highlights any potential weaknesses it may have. These are important precursors to the randomization and subsequent statistical analysis and can be easily overlooked by a non-statistician.

Using the Structure of the Experimental Design and the Randomization to Construct a Mixed Model,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2016,22,2,"Constructing an appropriate statistical model for an analysis can be difficult, particularly when a complex experimental design has been used. This paper describes a procedure that uses the structure of the design (summarized by the 'layout structure') in conjunction with the randomization to define the model terms that are included in a mixed model statistical analysis. Randomization objects (which form the 'restricted layout structure' and can be visualized using a Hasse diagram) are developed from the layout structure and the randomization(s) to establish these model terms. The use of the procedure enables consistency of models where the scope for analyst's choice of terms is clearly specified and makes developing the appropriate statistical model more accessible. It also highlights the importance of the role of randomization in model specification.","Experiment Scheme,Hasse Diagram,Layout Structure,Restricted Layout Structure",SPLIT-PLOT,"Bate, Simon T.@GlaxoSmithKline, Stat Sci Europe, Med Res Ctr, Gunnels Wood Rd, Stevenage SG1 2NY, Herts, England::Chatfield, Marion J.@GlaxoSmithKline, Stat Sci Europe, Med Res Ctr, Gunnels Wood Rd, Stevenage SG1 2NY, Herts, England","Bate, Simon T.@GlaxoSmithKline::Chatfield, Marion J.@GlaxoSmithKline",not exist,"Fisher, Bradford Hill, and randomization+Armitage, P+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+DEC 2003::no title+Armitage, P.; Berry, G.; Matthews, J.

A New Function for Generating Local Bandwidths for Semi-Parametric MRR2 Model in Response Surface Methodology,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2016,40,0,"The modeling phase of response surface methodology (RSM) involves the application of regression techniques to fitting a curve to the data generated from a designed experiment. The model-robust regression 2 (MRR2) method is a semi-parametric regression approach that combines portions of estimates from both the parametric and the nonparametric regression approaches via a mixing parameter. However, the robustness of the estimates from the MRR2 approach depends largely on the choice of bandwidth. Utilizing the cross-validation approach to bandwidth selection, we propose a methodology for deriving a data-driven function that generates local bandwidths for the MRR2 approach. Using two examples from the literature and a simulation study, we show that, in comparison with other regression methods, the results obtained from the MRR2 approach utilizing the proposed function offer remarkable improvements in the goodness of-fit statistics.","Bandwidth-Selection Criteria,Nonparametric Regression Methods","VARIABLE BANDWIDTH,NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION,POLYNOMIAL REGRESSION,ROBUST REGRESSION,KERNEL REGRESSION,SELECTION","Edionwe, Efosa@Univ Benin, Dept Math, Benin, Nigeria::Mbegbu, Julian I.@Univ Benin, Dept Math, Benin, Nigeria::Nwosu, Chinwe R.@Nnamdi Azikiwe Univ, Dept Stat, Awka, Nigeria","Edionwe, Efosa@University of Benin::Mbegbu, Julian I.@University of Benin::Nwosu, Chinwe R.@Unknow",not exist,"The Use of Genetic Algorithm in Response Surface Methodology+ALVEREZ, M.

Small Mixed-Level Screening Designs with Orthogonal Quadratic Effects,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2016,13,1,"This paper discusses an algorithm for constructing mixed-level screening designs (MLSDs) by augmenting some columns of a definitive screening designs (DSDs) with additional two-level columns. The constructed designs have the quadratic effects being orthogonal to main effects. The algorithm is used to construct designs with the number of runs being equal to p (i.e., the number of model parameters) for even p or p 1 for odd p. The performance of these small DSD-based MLSDs in terms of the D-efficiency is evaluated against the 60 small MLSDs of Yang et al.

An Experimental Diagnostic Procedure to Identify the Source of Defects in Multi-Stage and Multi-Component Production Processes,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2016,11,1,"Many production processes consist of successive steps in which things can go wrong without notice because the problem is only detectable in the final product. For instance in steel manufacturing, the coils undergo melting, hot rolling, annealing and pickling, and defects in one of these stages only become visible after the final process. In other production processes, an output issue may only be detected during final testing after the different parts have been assembled. In all these cases, it is hard to determine which part of the production process is responsible for an unusually high defect rate. We describe a simple procedure based on cluster detection to identify the problematic step if the following conditions are satisfied: the production of defects tends to occur clustered in time and it is feasible to (partially) reorder the part or batch processing sequence in each stage of the production process. Even if reordering is not required for the production, the diagnostic information that can be obtained can well outweigh the potential extra costs involved.","Cluster Detection,Ljung-Box Statistic,Problem Detection,Quality Control,Scan Statistic",SCAN STATISTICS,"Vandebroek, Martina@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Naamsestr 69, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium::Lan, Lan@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Naamsestr 69, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium::Knapen, Koen@SAS Inst Belgium, Luxembourg, Luxembourg","Vandebroek, Martina@KU Leuven::Lan, Lan@KU Leuven::Knapen, Koen@Unknow","Vandebroek, Martina@J-9103-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0317-1986","THE CRITERION METHOD: SOME ANALYSES AND REMARKS.+BOGARTZ, R S+Psychological bulletin+1965-Jul::Approximations for Two-Dimensional Variable Window Scan Statistics+Chen, Jie; Glaz, Joseph+SCAN STATISTICS: METHODS AND APPLICATIONS+2009::no title+Glaz, J; Naus, J.

Planning Fatigue Tests for Polymer Composites,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2016,27,1,"Polymer-composite materials have become key components in the transportation and alternative-energy industries, as they are more lightweight than homogeneous metals and alloys yet still retain comparable levels of strength and endurance. To understand how these polymer composites perform after long periods of use, material manufacturers commonly use cyclic fatigue testing. The current industrial standards include test plans with balanced designs and equal spacing of stress levels which, in many cases, are not the most statistically efficient designs. In this paper, we present optimal designs with the goal of minimizing the weighted sum of asymptotic variances of an estimated lifetime percentile at selected design stress levels. These designs are based on a physical model adapted from the fatigue literature, which is more suitable for modeling cyclic fatigue of polymer composites than the model used in the current industrial standards. We provide a comparison between our optimal designs and the traditional designs currently in use and ultimately propose a compromise design for use by practitioners in order to ensure robustness against deviations from the underlying assumptions.","Fatigue Lifetime Model,Large-Sample Approximate Variance,Log-Normal,Optimal Design,Tolerance Limits,Weibull","LIFE TEST PLANS,LIMIT MODEL,DISTRIBUTIONS,WEIBULL,CURVES","King, Caleb B.@Sandia Natl Labs, Stat Sci Grp, Albuquerque, NM 87123 USA::Hong, Yili@Virginia Tech, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Dehart, Stephanie P.@Eastman Chem Co, Appl Stat Grp, Kingsport, TN 37662 USA::Defeo, Patrick A.@DuPont Co Inc, Appl Stat Grp, Wilmington, DE 19803 USA::Pan, Rong@Arizona State Univ, Sch CIDSE, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","King, Caleb B.@United States Department of Energy (DOE)@Sandia National Laboratory::Hong, Yili@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Dehart, Stephanie P.@Eastman Chemical Company::Defeo, Patrick A.@DuPont::Pan, Rong@Arizona State University",not exist,"Test Method for Tension-Tension Fatigue of Polymer Matrix Composite Materials+[Anonymous].+ASTM D3479+2012::Standard Practice for Calculating Sample Size to Estimate, with Specified Precision, the Average for a Characteristic of a Lot or Process+[Anonymous].+ASTM E122+2009::no title+no author+Practice for Statistical Analysis of Linear or Linearized Stress-Life (S-N) and Strain-Life (e-N) Fatigue Data, E739+2010::no title+Castillo, E; Fernandez-Canteli, A.+A unified statistical methodology for modeling fatigue damage+2009::no title+CASTILLO E+INT ASS BRIDG STRUCT+1985::MODELING LIFETIME DATA WITH APPLICATION TO FATIGUE MODELS+CASTILLO, E; HADI, AS+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1995::An empirical model for fatigue behavior prediction of glass fibre-reinforced plastic composites for various stress ratios and test frequencies+Epaarachchi, JA; Clausen, PD+COMPOSITES PART A-APPLIED SCIENCE AND MANUFACTURING+2003::A study on estimation of damage accumulation of glass fibre reinforce plastic (GFRP) composites under a block loading situation+Epaarachchi, Jayantha A.+COMPOSITE STRUCTURES+SEP 2006::A Tool for Evaluating Time-Varying-Stress Accelerated Life Test Plans With Log-Location-Scale Distributions+Hong, Yili; Ma, Haiming; Meeker, William Q.+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY+DEC 2010::Bayesian Life Test Planning for Log-Location-Scale Family of Distributions+Hong, Yili; King, Caleb; Zhang, Yao; et al.+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 2015::Analysis of Reliability Experiments with Random Blocks and Subsampling+Kensler, Jennifer L.

Bayesian Networks in Survey Data: Robustness and Sensitivity Issues,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2016,32,5,"Bayesian networks (BN) implement a graphical model structure known as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that is popular in statistics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. They enable an effective representation and computation of a joint probability distribution (JPD) over a set of random variables. The paper focuses on the selection of a robust network structure according to different learning algorithms and the measure of arc strength using resampling techniques. Moreover, it shows how 'what-if' sensitivity scenarios are generated with BN using hard and soft evidence in the framework of predictive inference. Establishing a robust network structure and using it for decision support are two essential enablers for efficient and effective applications of BN to improvements of products and processes.

A Robust Multivariate EWMA Control Chart for Detecting Sparse Mean Shifts,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2016,60,1,"In multivariate statistical process control (MSPC) applications, process mean shifts sometimes occur in only a few components. To solve this MSPC problem, many control charts were proposed in the literature. Most of these charts assumed that the multivariate quality characteristics are normally distributed. Among them, the control chart proposed by Zou and Qiu (2009), incorporating the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method into the EWMA scheme, has the best overall performance. In this paper, we extend the classical multivariate LASSO control chart to a robust version that has an affine-invariance property and is distribution free under the family of elliptical direction distributions, indicating that the in-control run-length distribution is the same for any continuous distribution in this family and the control limit can be acquired from the multivariate standard normal distribution. Our simulation results show that the proposed method is very efficient in detecting various sparse shifts under heavy-tailed and skewed multivariate distributions. In addition, it is easy to implement with an iterative algorithm and the least angle regression (LARS) algorithm. White-wine data illustrates that the proposed control chart performs quite well in applications.","Affine Invariant,Distribution Free,Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator,Multivariate Statistical Process Control,Spatial Sign Test","STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,AUTOCORRELATED PROCESSES,MEASUREMENT ERROR,PROCESS VARIABILITY,QUALITY-CONTROL,SIGN TEST,LASSO,REGRESSION,PERFORMANCE,VARIABLES","Liang, Wenjuan@E China Normal Univ, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China@Huangshan Univ, Huangshan, Anhui, Peoples R China::Xiang, Dongdong@E China Normal Univ, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China::Pu, Xiaolong@E China Normal Univ, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China","Liang, Wenjuan@East China Normal University::Xiang, Dongdong@East China Normal University::Pu, Xiaolong@East China Normal University",not exist,"The GLRT for statistical process control of autocorrelated processes+Apley, DW; Shi, J+IIE TRANSACTIONS+SEP 1999::Operating transformation retransformation on spatial median and angle test+Chakraborty, B; Chaudhuri, P; Oja, H+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 1998::Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties+Cortez, Paulo; Cerdeira, Antonio; Almeida, Fernando; et al.+DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS+NOV 2009::Multivariate Generations of Cumulative Sum Quality Control Schemes+CROSIER, R.

A Study of Missing Data Imputation in Predictive Modeling of a Wood-Composite Manufacturing Process,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2016,48,0,"Problem: Real-time process data and destructive test data were collected and merged from a wood composite manufacturer in the southeastern US for the purpose of developing real-time predictive models for strength properties of manufactured particleboard. Sensor malfunction and other real-time data problems lead to null fields in the company's data warehouse, resulting in information loss. Many manufacturers attempt to build accurate predictive models excluding entire records with null fields or use summary statistics such as the average or median in place of the null field. However, predictive-model errors in validation may be higher in the presence of information loss and may misguide the production process.

Approach: This paper summarizes an application of missing-data imputation methods in predictive modeling of a wood-composite manufacturing process. Variable selection was applied prior to imputing missing data. Two missing data-imputation methods were selected after comparing six possible methods. Predictive models of imputed data were developed using partial least squares regression (PLSR) and were compared with models developed from nonimputed data.

Results: Maximum likelihood-based imputation using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and multiple imputation (Ml) using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation achieved lower root mean-square error of prediction results than imputation based on the mean/median substitution, last observation-carried-forward (LOCF), or a ""hot-deck"" method using single imputation. Predictive models based on the imputed dataset generated more precise prediction results than models based on nonimputed datasets. Outcomes of the study included avoiding rework and scrap when model predictions alerted of an imminent strength failure and minor reductions were made in resin input set points. Senior management of the company indicated that a savings occurred as a result of the study from lower resin usage (the second highest cost component of manufactured product).","Imputation,LASSO,MCMC,Predictive Modeling,Variable Selection","PARTIAL LEAST-SQUARES,MULTIPLE IMPUTATION,VARIABLE SELECTION,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,PRINCIPAL COMPONENT,INTERNAL BOND,EM ALGORITHM,REGRESSION,STRENGTH,LASSO","Zeng, Yan@Lending Club, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA::Young, Timothy M.@Ctr Renewable Carbon, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA::Edwards, David J.@Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Richmond, VA 23284 USA::Guess, Frank M.@Univ Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA::Chen, Chung-Hao@Old Dominion Univ, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA","Zeng, Yan@Unknow::Young, Timothy M.@Unknow::Edwards, David J.@Virginia Commonwealth University::Guess, Frank M.@University of Tennessee Knoxville@University of Tennessee System::Chen, Chung-Hao@Old Dominion University","Young, Timothy@D-9949-2011@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9564-6506","no title+Agarwal, S.+Learning from Incomplete Data+2001::Multiple imputation for missing data - A cautionary tale+Allison, PD+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS &amp; RESEARCH+FEB 2000::Hot-Deck Imputation: A Simple DATA Step Approach+Altmayer, L.+P 2002 NE SAS US GRO+2002::Real-time process modeling of particleboard manufacture using variable selection and regression methods ensemble+Andre, Nicolas; Young, Timothy M.+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WOOD AND WOOD PRODUCTS+MAY 2013::Prediction of internal bond strength in a medium density fiberboard process using multivariate statistical methods and variable selection+Andre, Nicolas; Cho, Hyun-Woo; Baek, Seung Hyun; et al.+WOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY+OCT 2008::A model of the effect of strand length and strand thickness on the strength properties of oriented wood composites+Barnes, D+FOREST PRODUCTS JOURNAL+FEB 2001::no title+Belsley, DA; Kuh, E; Welsch, RE.+Regression Diagnostics: Identifying Influential Data and Sources of Collinearity+1980::BART: BAYESIAN ADDITIVE REGRESSION TREES+Chipman, Hugh A.; George, Edward I.; McCulloch, Robert E.+ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS+MAR 2010::Predictive modeling the internal bond of medium density fiberboard using a modified principal component analysis+Clapp, Ned E., Jr.; Young, Timothy M.; Guess, Frank M.+FOREST PRODUCTS JOURNAL+APR 2008::A comparison of inclusive and restrictive strategies in modern missing data procedures+Collins, LM; Schafer, JL; Kam, CM+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+DEC 2001::Predicting patient survival from microarray data by accelerated failure time modeling using partial least squares and LASSO+Datta, Susmita; Le-Rademacher, Jennifer; Datta, Somnath+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2007::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::A case study of stochastic optimization in health policy: Problem formulation and preliminary results+Draper, D; Fouskakis, D+JOURNAL OF GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION+DEC 2000::Least angle regression+Efron, B; Hastie, T; Johnstone, I; et al.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2004::The impact of nonnormality on full information maximum-likelihood estimation for structural equation models with missing data+Enders, CK+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+DEC 2001::no title+Faraway, J.

Using Curve-Registration Information for Profile Monitoring,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2016,57,3,"The quality characteristics in manufacturing processes are often represented in terms of spatially- or time ordered data, called ""profiles"", which are characterized by amplitude and phase variability. In this context, curve registration plays a key role, as it allows separating the two kinds of between-profiles variability and reducing any undesired inflation of the natural phase variability. In the mainstream literature, warping functions are not generally considered in the monitoring process, even though this may cause significant information loss. We propose a novel approach for profile monitoring that combines the functional principal component analysis and the use of parametric warping functions. The key idea is to jointly monitor the stability over time of the registered profiles (i.e., the information related to amplitude variability) and the registration coefficients (i.e., the information related to phase variability). This allows improving the capability of detecting unnatural pattern modifications, thanks to a better characterization of the overall natural variability. The benefits of a proper management of functional data registration, together with the advantages over the most common approaches used in the literature, are demonstrated by means of Monte Carlo simulations. The proposed methodology is finally applied to a real industrial case study relying on a dataset acquired in waterjet cutting processes under different health conditions of the machine tool.","Curve Registration,Functional-Data Analysis,Profile Monitoring,Warping Functions","MIXED-EFFECTS MODELS,REGRESSION SPLINES,MANUFACTURING PROCESSES,NONLINEAR PROFILES,FUNCTIONAL DATA,CAROTID-ARTERY,CONTROL CHART,SIGNALS,APPROXIMATION,ALIGNMENT","Grasso, Marco@Politecn Milan, Dept Mech Engn, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy::Menafoglio, Alessandra@Politecn Milan, Dept Math, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy::Colosimo, Bianca M.@Politecn Milan, Dept Mech Engn, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy::Secchi, Piercesare@Politecn Milan, Dept Math, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy","Grasso, Marco@Polytechnic University of Milan::Menafoglio, Alessandra@Polytechnic University of Milan::Colosimo, Bianca M.@Polytechnic University of Milan::Secchi, Piercesare@Polytechnic University of Milan","Grasso, Marco Luigi Giuseppe@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3233-4198","Self-modelling regression for longitudinal data with time-invariant covariates+Altman, NS; Villarreal, JC+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+SEP 2004::no title+Amiri, A.; Noorossana, R.; Saghaei, A.+Statistical Analysis of Profile Monitoring+2012::Measurements, analysis, and interpretation of the signals from a high-pressure waterjet pump+Annoni, Massimiliano; Cristaldi, Loredana; Lazzaroni, Massimo+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT+JAN 2008::no title+Bowman, A.

Assessing Binary Measurement Systems: A Cost-Effective Alternative to Complete Verification,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2016,19,0,"Suppose we plan to assess a binary measurement system when the misclassification probabilities vary from part to part. We consider the estimation of the average error probabilities of such a system when a gold standard (error-free) system is available to verify the status of any part. We examine plans where we first measure a sample of n parts r times each with the binary measurement system. Then we study the impact on the precision and robustness of the estimates if we use the gold-standard system to verify the true status of none, some, or all of the sampled parts. We show that a partial verification plan has comparable performance to full verification in terms of the precision and robustness of the estimates while requiring as few as 10% of parts to be verified. When the gold-standard system is expensive or time consuming, eliminating the need to verify all parts dramatically reduces the cost of the assessment study.","Beta Binomial,Gage Capability,Measurement System Analysis,Misclassification Probabilities,Pass-Fail Inspection,Random Effects","VARYING MISCLASSIFICATION RATES,LATENT CLASS ANALYSIS,GOLD STANDARD,DIAGNOSTIC-TESTS,INSPECTION,ACCURACY,MODELS,BIAS","Severn, Daniel E.@Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada::Steiner, Stefan H.@Business & Ind Stat Res Grp, Waterloo, ON, Canada@Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada::MacKay, R.

Robust Multivariate Control Chart Based on Goodness-of-Fit Test,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2016,47,0,"This paper proposes a distribution-free multivariate statistical process control (MSPC) chart to detect general distributional changes in multivariate process variables. The chart is deployed based on a multivariate goodness-of-fit test, which is extendible to high-dimensional observations. The chart also employs data-dependent control limits, which are computed on line along with the charting statistics, to ensure satisfactory and robust charting performance of the proposed method. Through theoretical and numerical analyses, we have shown that the proposed chart is exactly distribution-free and able to operate with an unknown in-control (IC) distribution or limited reference samples. The chart also has robust IC performance as well as satisfactory out-of-control (OC) detection power for general process changes without any assumption of the process distribution. A real-data example in semiconductor production processes is presented to demonstrate the application and effectiveness of our method.","Distribution Free,Empirical Distribution,Multivariate Statistical Process Control,Nonparametric,Self-Starting","EWMA CONTROL CHART,STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,CHANGE-POINT MODEL,QUALITY-CONTROL,LIKELIHOOD-RATIO,COVARIANCE-MATRIX,MEAN VECTOR,VARIABILITY,LOCATION","Zhang, Chen@Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Singapore 117548, Singapore::Chen, Nan@Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Singapore 117548, Singapore::Zou, Changliang@Nankai Univ, Inst Stat, Tianjin, Peoples R China@Nankai Univ, LPMC, Tianjin, Peoples R China","Zhang, Chen@National University of Singapore::Chen, Nan@National University of Singapore::Zou, Changliang@Nankai University",not exist,"Multivariate Quality Control+Alt, F.

Confirmation Runs in Design of Experiments,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2016,69,1,"Throughout the literature on design of experiments, the need to perform confirmation runs has been repeatedly emphasized. We provide a high-level framework for design of experiments and show how the confirmation phase is becoming increasingly important. However, the literature provides little guidance on how to assess the confirmation runs nor how many confirmation runs to perform. We provide a review of the literature that addresses confirmation runs. We propose several methods for assessing confirmation runs based on statistical intervals. A simulation study shows which are the best approaches for assessing confirmation runs. We then give some guidance on how many confirmation runs are appropriate and what to do when one fails a confirmation experiment.","Factor Ranges,Intervals,Model Building,Optimization,Sample Size,Sequential Experimentation","RESPONSE-SURFACE METHODOLOGY,EXPLORATORY DATA-ANALYSIS,PARAMETER DESIGN,TAGUCHI,STATISTICS,REGRESSION","Jensen, Willis A.@WL Gore & Assoc Inc, Flagstaff, AZ 86005 USA","Jensen, Willis A.@Unknow",not exist,"Winning Back the Customer's Confidence: A Case Study on the Application of Design of Experiments to an Injection Molding Process+Acharya, UH; Mahesh, C.+Quality Engineering+1999::Improving the Yield of Silica Gel in a Chemical Plant+Anand, K.N.+Quality Engineering+1997::The Role of Statistics in Determining Product and Part Specifications: A Few Indian Experiences+Anand, K.

The Case Against the Use of Synthetic Control Charts,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2016,35,5,"The synthetic chart principle proposed by Wu and Spedding (2000) initiated a stream of publications in the control charting literature. Originally, it was claimed that the new chart has superior average run length (ARL) properties. Davis and Woodall (2002) indicated that the synthetic chart is nothing else than a particular runs-rule chart. Moreover, they criticized the design of the performance evaluation and advocated use of the steady-state ARL. The latter measure was used then, e.g., in Wu et al. (2010). In most of the papers on synthetic charts that actually used the steady-state framework, it was not rigorously described. See Khoo et al. (2011) as an exception, where it was revealed that the cyclical steady-state design was considered. The aim of this paper is to carefully analyze the steady-state (cyclical and the more popular conditional) for the synthetic chart, the original ""2 of L + 1"" (L >= 1) runs-rule chart, and competing EWMA charts with two types of control limits. It turns out that the EWMA chart has a uniformly (over a large range of potential shifts) better steady-state ARL performance than the synthetic chart. Furthermore, the synthetic control chart exhibits the poorest performance among all considered competitors. Thus, we advise not applying synthetic control charts.","Conditional and Cyclical Steady-State Average Run Length,Conditional Expected Delay,Markov Chain,Numerical Solution of Integral Equations,Runs Rules,Zero-State Average Run Length","SUPPLEMENTARY RUNS RULES,QUALITY-CONTROL,X CHART,LENGTH,DISTRIBUTIONS,SCHEMES,TESTS","Knoth, Sven@Univ Fed Armed Forces Hamburg, Helmut Schmidt Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Sch Econ & Social Sci, POB 700822, D-22008 Hamburg, Germany","Knoth, Sven@Unknow","Knoth, Sven@D-1209-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9666-5554","The revised m-of-k runs rule+Antzoulakos, D.L.; Rakitzis, A.C.+Quality Engineering+Jan.-March 2008::no title+Asmussen, S.+Applied Probability and Queues+1987::no title+Brass, H.; Petras, K.+MATH SURVEYS MONOGRA+2011::APPROACH TO PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION OF CUSUM RUN LENGTH+BROOK, D; EVANS, DA+BIOMETRIKA+1972::Evaluation of the run-length distribution for a combined Shewhart-EWMA control chart+Capizzi, Giovanna; Masarotto, Guido+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+JAN 2010::STEADY-STATE RUN LENGTH ANALYSIS OF A SHEWHART QUALITY-CONTROL CHART WITH SUPPLEMENTARY RUNS RULES+CHAMP, CW+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1992::EXACT RESULTS FOR SHEWHART CONTROL CHARTS WITH SUPPLEMENTARY RUNS RULES+CHAMP, CW; WOODALL, WH+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1987::A NEW 2-SIDED CUMULATIVE SUM QUALITY-CONTROL SCHEME+CROSIER, RB+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 1986::A SIMPLE METHOD FOR STUDYING RUN-LENGTH DISTRIBUTIONS OF EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE CHARTS+CROWDER, SV+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1987::On quasi-stationary distributions in absorbing discrete-time finite Markov chains+Darroch, J.

Analysis of Subjective Ordinal Responses in Mixture Experiments,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2016,15,1,"Problem: This case study involves a mixture experiment with three components where the primary response, fragrance intensity, is subjectively evaluated by 40 fragrance experts using a seven-point intensity scale. The problem is motivated by the addition of two new components that are purported to enhance fragrance intensity. The common practice in analyzing ordinal ratings is to use the averaged ratings across panelists and to analyze these responses as if they were numeric. However, this approach yields results that are not meaningful and difficult to interpret because of the ordinality of the rating scale. Recommendations for modeling ordinal responses from mixture experiments have not been dealt with in the literature, so the techniques described here have a broader application to other experimental settings.

Approach: When responses are subjectively assessed and the rating scale is arbitrarily assigned, Anderson's (1984) stereotype regression model presents a flexible alternative to the widely popular proportional odds model. The modeling approach presented in this paper addresses the issue of inestimability of model parameters due to perfect collinearity among the mixture components, as well as the uncertainty in the discretization of the ordered, categorical response. For this case study, the assignment of ordinal scales to sensory levels is done in an arbitrary manner, such that no historical studies support the effectiveness of the assignment. Comparisons are made among the stereotype, the proportional odds, and traditional regression modeling where the numeric averages of the ordinal responses are analyzed.

Results: In this case study, the stereotype model revealed that adjacent categories of the ordered, categorical response are indistinguishable with respect to the changes in the proportions of the mixture components. Internal tests for indistinguishability provided statistical justification for collapsing the categories, and in so doing, the more parsimonious proportional odds form was found to satisfactorily model and improve the interpretability of the reconfigured responses. Analysis revealed that one of the two new components introduced to the formula significantly improved the perception of fragrance intensity; hence, adoption of the new compound was strongly justified.","Categorical Data,Formulation Experiments,Proportional Odds,Rated Responses,Stereotype","REGRESSION,SCALES","Mancenido, Michelle@Arizona State Univ, Sch Comp Informat & Decis Syst Engn, Tempe, AZ USA::Pan, Rong@Arizona State Univ, Sch Comp Informat & Decis Syst Engn, Tempe, AZ USA::Montgomery, Douglas@Arizona State Univ, Sch Comp Informat & Decis Syst Engn, Tempe, AZ USA","Mancenido, Michelle@Arizona State University::Pan, Rong@Arizona State University::Montgomery, Douglas@Arizona State University",not exist,"no title+Agresti, A.+Analysis of Ordinal Categorical Data+2010::Bayesian inference for the stereotype regression model: application to a case-control study of prostate cancer+Ahn, Jaeil; Mukherjee, Bhramar; Banerjee, Mousumi; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+NOV 10 2009::REGRESSION AND ORDERED CATEGORICAL VARIABLES+ANDERSON, JA+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1984::no title+Cornell, J.

Statistical Learning Methods Applied to Process Monitoring: An Overview and Perspective,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2016,140,6,"The increasing availability of high-volume, high-velocity data sets, often containing variables of different data types, brings an increasing need for monitoring tools that are designed to handle these big data sets. While the research on multivariate statistical process monitoring tools is vast, the application of these tools for big data sets has received less attention. In this expository paper, we give an overview of the current state of data-driven multivariate statistical process monitoring methodology. We highlight some of the main directions involving statistical learning and dimension reduction techniques applied to control charts in research from supply chain, engineering, computer science, and statistics. The goal of this paper is to bring into better focus some of the monitoring and surveillance methodology informed by data mining techniques that show promise for monitoring large and diverse data sets. We introduce an example using Wikipedia search information and illustrate a few of the complexities of applying the available methods to a high-dimensional monitoring scenario. Throughout, we offer advice to practitioners and some suggestions for future research in this emerging area of research.","Control Charts,Ensembles,Neural Networks,Regression,Support Vector Machines,Variable Selection","PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS,MULTIVARIATE CONTROL CHART,SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES,PUBLIC-HEALTH SURVEILLANCE,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS,SHEWHART CONTROL CHARTS,LEAST ANGLE REGRESSION,GAUSSIAN MIXTURE MODEL,OF-CONTROL SIGNALS,DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS","Weese, Maria@Miami Univ, Farmer Sch Business, Analyt, Oxford, OH 45056 USA::Martinez, Waldyn@Miami Univ, Farmer Sch Business, Analyt, Oxford, OH 45056 USA::Megahed, Fadel M.@Auburn Univ, Ind & Syst Engn, Auburn, AL 36849 USA::Jones-Farmer, L.

Monitoring Temporal Homogeneity in Attributed Network Streams,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2016,38,8,"Network modeling and analysis has become a fundamental tool for studying various complex systems. This paper proposes an extension of statistical monitoring to network streams, which is crucial for effective decision-making in various applications. To this end, a model for the probability of edge existence as a function of vertex attributes is constructed and a likelihood method is developed to monitor the underlying network model. The method is flexible to detect any form of anomaly that arises from different network edge-formation mechanisms. Experiments on simulated and real network streams depict the properties and benefits of the method compared with existing methods in the literature.","Change Detection,Dynamic Network,Likelihood-Ratio Test","CONTROL CHARTS,SOCIAL NETWORKS,CENTRALITY","Azarnoush, Bahareh@Netflix Inc, Los Gatos, CA 95032 USA::Paynabar, Kamran@Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA::Bekki, Jennifer@Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA::Runger, George@Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Azarnoush, Bahareh@Unknow::Paynabar, Kamran@Georgia Institute of Technology@University System of Georgia::Bekki, Jennifer@Arizona State University::Runger, George@Arizona State University",not exist,"no title+[Anonymous].+Society of Industrial and Applied Math Data mining Conference+2006::Emergence of scaling in random networks+Barabasi, AL; Albert, R+SCIENCE+OCT 15 1999::Self-Starting CUSCORE Control Charts for Individual Multivariate Observations+Capizzi, Giovanna; Masarotto, Guido+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 2010::R-MAT: A Recursive Model for Graph Mining+CHAKRABARTI, D.; ZHAN, Y.; FALOUTSOS, C.+SOC IND APPL MATH DA+2004::System Monitoring with Real-Time Contrasts+Deng, Houtao; Runger, George; Tuv, Eugene+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2012::no title+Erdos, P.; Renyi, A.+Publ.

A Study of Two Types of Split-Plot Designs,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2016,23,0,"This paper discusses two types of split-plot designs, split-plot designs with few whole-plot factors and blocked split-plot designs.

The Statistical Evaluation of a Binary Test Based on Combined Samples,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2016,24,2,"The statistical evaluation of the reliability of binary tests and inspections is a challenging endeavor. In this paper, we propose an approach for the common situation where the true condition of the inspected items is unobservable (""gold-standard unavailable""), the probabilities of false acceptance and false rejection vary across items, and rejections are relatively rare. Our approach fits a latent-variable model, where the variability in misclassification probabilities is driven by a continuous property of a part. To deal with the low prevalence of rejections, we propose sampling items from multiple sources. The performance and properties of the estimators are assessed using simulation, asymptotic approximations, and a real-life case at a car-parts manufacturer.","Accuracy of Diagnostic Tests,Latent-Variable Model,Measurement Reliability,Measurement System Analysis,Pass/Fail Inspection","MEASUREMENT SYSTEM-ANALYSIS,CLINICAL-DIAGNOSIS,INSPECTION,RATES,MODEL","Erdmann, Tashi P.@Univ Amsterdam IBIS UvA, Inst Business & Ind Stat, Plantage Muidergracht 12, NL-1018 TV Amsterdam, Netherlands::Akkerhuis, Thomas S.@Univ Amsterdam IBIS UvA, Inst Business & Ind Stat, Plantage Muidergracht 12, NL-1018 TV Amsterdam, Netherlands::De Mast, Jeroen@Univ Amsterdam IBIS UvA, Inst Business & Ind Stat, Plantage Muidergracht 12, NL-1018 TV Amsterdam, Netherlands::Steiner, Stefan H.@Univ Waterloo, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada","Erdmann, Tashi P.@University of Amsterdam::Akkerhuis, Thomas S.@University of Amsterdam::De Mast, Jeroen@University of Amsterdam::Steiner, Stefan H.@University of Waterloo",not exist,"no title+[Anonymous].+AIAG-Measurement Systems Analysis, Reference Manual+2003::no title+[Anonymous].+Mathematica 8+2010::A CLASS OF DISTRIBUTIONS WHICH INCLUDES THE NORMAL ONES+AZZALINI, A+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+1985::Gauge capability for pass-fail inspection+Boyles, RA+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 2001::Assessing a Binary Measurement System with Varying Misclassification Rates Using a Latent Class Random Effects Model+Danila, Oana; Steiner, Stefan H.; MacKay, R.

A Gradient Approach to the Optimal Design of CUSUM Charts Under Unknown Mean-Shift Sizes,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2016,28,2,"Traditional cumulative sum (CUSUM) control charts are often designed to optimize the detection performance for a prescribed magnitude of mean shift when monitoring the mean level of a process. However, the shift to occur in the future is often unknown. To account for the uncertainty of the shift size, different design criteria have been proposed. However, all the design methods discussed in the literature are based on Monte Carlo simulations, and the optimal parameters are obtained in a trial-and-error manner (e.g., Ryu et al. (2010)). Notice that the average-run length (ARL) of the CUSUM chart can be formulated as an integral equation based on the recurrence relationship of the CUSUM charting statistics; this paper proposes a gradient-based approach for efficient design and analysis of CUSUM charts under unknown mean-shift sizes. The proposed method is shown to be more accurate and efficient than Monte Carlo simulations.","Average-Run Length,Economic Loss,Monte Carlo Simulation,Statistical Process Control",EWMA,"Huang, Wenpo@Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China::Shu, Lianjie@Univ Macau, Fac Business Adm, Beijing, Peoples R China::Jiang, Wei@Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China","Huang, Wenpo@Shanghai Jiao Tong University::Shu, Lianjie@University of Macau::Jiang, Wei@Shanghai Jiao Tong University",not exist,"INFLUENCE OF REFERENCE VALUES AND ESTIMATED VARIANCE ON ARL OF CUSUM TESTS+BAGSHAW, M; JOHNSON, RA+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1975::no title+Baker, CTH.+The numerical treatment of integral equations+1977::no title+BERGER JO+STAT DECISION THEORY+1995::no title+Burden, Richard L.; Faires, J.+Douglas Numerical analysis+2010::Design of EWMA and CUSUM control charts subject to random shift sizes and quality impacts+Chen, Argon; Chen, Y.

Nonlinear Profile Monitoring for Oven-Temperature Data,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2016,30,1,"Problem: The monitoring of a key input, temperature, in a manufacturing process produces large amounts of data. It is difficult to determine an appropriate control-chart methodology that allows the chart user to determine when there are problems with this step of the manufacturing process. Current approaches for process monitoring involve the output data gathered after the process has been completed. It would be preferable to establish process monitoring on the process inputs. However, this is challenging when there is a large amount of process input data. Current phase I monitoring of the process inputs involve the use of individual control charts on some selected data from the temperature profiles that represent some features determined based on expert judgment. This approach does not use all the data nor does it take into account the potential correlation that exists among the selected data.

Approach: We propose the use of a nonlinear model for modeling the profiles, thereby reducing the profiles to a smaller set of parameter estimates. For this nonlinear model data reduction approach, the parameter estimates and residual variability can then be used in the appropriate monitoring procedure. We show that a control chart based on the classical covariance-matrix estimate fails to detect large significant process changes, but the successive differences covariance matrix performs better. The statistic based on the successive differences is modified to account for the correlation between the profiles. We illustrate both the phase I and phase II analysis for these data.

Results: The proposed data reduction approach and monitoring procedure makes use of all the available data and detects important process shifts where the interpretation of the nonlinear model parameters facilitates the root-cause investigation. This parametric approach can be easily automated using existing statistical software and results in a smaller number of control charts, which is a manageable way to determine the current state of the process. We highlight some issues that are raised by this particular dataset that have not been adequately addressed in the profile-monitoring literature.","Common Fixed Design,Multivariate Statistical Process Control,Nonlinear models,Phase I,Principal Components,Temperature Profiles,T-2 Statistic","STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,PHASE-I ANALYSIS,CONTROL CHARTS,MODELS","Jensen, Willis A.@WL Gore & Assoc Inc, Flagstaff, AZ USA::Grimshaw, Scott D.@Brigham Young Univ, Dept Stat, Provo, UT 84602 USA::Espen, Ben@WL Gore & Assoc Inc, Flagstaff, AZ USA","Jensen, Willis A.@Unknow::Grimshaw, Scott D.@Brigham Young University::Espen, Ben@Unknow",not exist,"A Semiparametric Mixed Model Approach to Phase I Profile Monitoring+Abdel-Salam, Abdel-Salam G.; Birch, Jeffrey B.; Jensen, Willis A.+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+JUN 2013::A Case Study on Monitoring Polynomial Profiles in the Automotive Industry+Amiri, Amirhossein; Jensen, Willis A.; Kazemzadeh, Reza Baradaran+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+JUL 2010::Statistical process control for monitoring non-linear profiles using wavelet filtering and B-Spline approximation+Chang, Shing I.; Yadama, Srikanth+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH+2010::Statistical Process Control for Monitoring Nonlinear Profiles: A Six Sigma Project on Curing Process+Chang, Shing I.; Tsai, Tzong-Ru; Lin, Dennis K.

Optimal Design of Blocked Experiments in the Presence of Supplementary Information About the Blocks,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2015,36,2,"In some designed experiments, measurements of characteristics of the experimental units may be available prior to performing the runs. If the investigators believe that these measured characteristics may have some effect on the response of interest, then it seems natural to include these characteristics as factors in the experiment even though they are not under direct control. It may also be possible to apply multiple runs to a given experimental unit by subdividing it into multiple pieces, each having the same characteristics. A similar scenario involves using a person or an animal as an experimental unit multiple times but with different treatments. Here, the measured information about the subjects may not change over the experiment. In either of these cases, the fact that several runs employ the same experimental unit means that the responses for those runs are correlated. This correlation, in addition to the natural variability of the measured characteristics over the sample of available experimental units, requires new methodology for creating optimal designs. Specifically, the methodology must choose a subset of the experimental units and determine the number of treatments applied to each experimental unit in addition to choosing the level combinations of the controllable factors for each run. In this article, we provide two methods for generating optimal designs in the presence of additional information about the experimental units. The first method fixes the number of runs performed on each experimental unit. The second method allows for varying numbers of runs applied to each experimental unit, subject to a constraint on the total number of runs. We discuss several illustrative examples using each method as well as a real experiment using previously fabricated batches of polypropylene as experimental units in a study on the effects of a subsequent plasma treatment.","Blocked Experiment,Concomitant Variable,Covariate,D-Optimality,I-Optimality,Split-Plot Experiment,V-Optimality","RESPONSE-SURFACE DESIGNS,SPLIT-PLOT DESIGNS,2-LEVEL FACTORIAL-DESIGNS,TREND,ROBUST,CONSTRUCTION,ALGORITHM","Jones, Bradley@SAS Inst, JMP Div, Cary, NC 27513 USA::Goos, Peter@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Biosci Engn, Louvain, Belgium@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven Stat Res Ctr, Louvain, Belgium@Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, Antwerp, Belgium@Univ Antwerp, StatUa Ctr Stat, Antwerp, Belgium","Jones, Bradley@Unknow::Goos, Peter@KU Leuven@University of Antwerp",not exist,"THE CONSTRUCTION OF EXACT D-OPTIMUM EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGNS WITH APPLICATION TO BLOCKING RESPONSE-SURFACE DESIGNS+ATKINSON, AC; DONEV, AN+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1989::Experimental designs optimally balanced for trend+Atkinson, AC; Donev, AN+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1996::Construction of Run Orders of Factorial Designs+Cheng, C.-S.+Statistical Design and Analysis of Industrial Experiments+1990::TREND ROBUST 2-LEVEL FACTORIAL-DESIGNS+CHENG, CS; STEINBERG, DM+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1991::THE CONSTRUCTION OF TREND-FREE RUN ORDERS OF 2-LEVEL FACTORIAL-DESIGNS+CHENG, CS; JACROUX, M+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1988::MARGINALLY RESTRICTED D-OPTIMAL DESIGNS+COOK, RD; THIBODEAU, LA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1980::COMPUTER-AIDED BLOCKING OF FACTORIAL AND RESPONSE-SURFACE DESIGNS+COOK, RD; NACHTSHEIM, CJ+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 1989::A COMPARISON OF ALGORITHMS FOR CONSTRUCTING EXACT D-OPTIMAL DESIGNS+COOK, RD; NACHTSHEIM, CJ+TECHNOMETRICS+1980::no title+Cornell, J.

Bayesian Life Test Planning for Log-Location-Scale Family of Distributions,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2015,35,4,"This paper describes Bayesian methods for life test planning with censored data from a log-location-scale distribution when prior information of the distribution parameters is available. We use a Bayesian criterion based on the estimation precision of a distribution quantile. A large-sample normal approximation gives a simplified, easy-to-interpret, yet valid approach to this planning problem, where in general no closed-form solutions are available. To illustrate this approach, we present numerical investigations using the Weibull distribution with type ll censoring. We also assess the effects of prior distribution choice. A simulation approach of the same Bayesian problem is also presented as a tool for visualization and validation. The validation results generally are consistent with those from the large-sample approximation approach.","Censoring,Information Matrix,Life Data,Log-Normal Distribution,Sample-Size Determination,Weibull Distribution","SINGLY CENSORED DATA,WEIBULL DISTRIBUTION,MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD,CONFIDENCE-LIMITS,DESIGN,INFERENCE,NUMBER,SIZES,PLANS","Hong, Yili@Virginia Tech, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::King, Caleb@Virginia Tech, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Zhang, Yao@Pfizer Global Res & Dev, Res Stat, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA::Meeker, William Q.@Iowa State Univ, Dept Stat, Ames, IA 50011 USA","Hong, Yili@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::King, Caleb@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Zhang, Yao@Pfizer::Meeker, William Q.@Iowa State University",not exist,"The choice of sample size and the method of maximum expected utility - Comments+Adcock, CJ+STATISTICIAN+1997::no title+Berger, J.

Response Surface Methodology Using Split-Plot Definitive Screening Designs,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2015,30,2,"Definitive screening designs are a new class of three-level designs. We investigate the performance of definitive screening designs in split-plot structures for one-step response surface methodology. The result of the projection eligibility and the study of D-efficiency and I-efficiency show that split-plot definitive screening designs perform well when the number of important factors is small. To reduce the risk of being unable to fit second-order models for response surfaces, we provide the column indexes of projections. Experimenters can assign potentially important factors to those columns to avoid ineligible projections. An example is presented to demonstrate how to analyze data for response surface methodology using the split-plot definitive screening design.","Central Composite Design,D-Efficiency,Eligible Projection,Equivalent-Estimation Design,Generalized Least Squares,I-Efficiency,Ordinary Least Squares,Orthogonal Array,Second-Order Model","EQUIVALENT-ESTIMATION,MINIMUM-ABERRATION","Lin, Chang-Yun@Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Appl Math, Taichung 40227, Taiwan@Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Inst Stat, Taichung 40227, Taiwan::Yang, Po@Univ Manitoba, Dept Stat, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada","Lin, Chang-Yun@National Chung Hsing University::Yang, Po@University of Manitoba",not exist,"Fractional factorial split-plot designs for robust parameter experiments+Bingham, D; Sitter, RR+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 2003::Minimum-aberration two-level fractional factorial split-plot designs+Bingham, D; Sitter, RR+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1999::Some theoretical results for fractional factorial split-plot designs+Bingham, DR; Sitter, RR+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+AUG 1999::Design issues in fractional factorial split-plot experiments+Bingham, DR; Sitter, RR+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2001::Factor Screening and Response Surface Exploration+Cheng, S.

Another Look at the EWMA Control Chart with Estimated Parameters,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2015,39,29,"When in-control process parameters are estimated, Phase II control chart performance will vary among practitioners due to the use of different Phase I data sets. The typical measure of Phase II control chart performance, the average run length (ARL), becomes a random variable due to the selection of a Phase I data set for estimation. Aspects of the ARL distribution, such as the standard deviation of the average run length (SDARL), can be used to quantify the between-practitioner variability in control chart performance. In this article, we assess the in-control performance of the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control chart in terms of the SDARL and percentiles of the ARL distribution when the process parameters are estimated. Our results show that the EWMA chart requires a much larger amount of Phase I data than previously recommended in the literature in order to sufficiently reduce the variation in the chart performance. We show that larger values of the EWMA smoothing constant result in higher levels of variability in the in-control ARL distribution; thus, more Phase I data are required for charts with larger smoothing constants. Because it could be extremely difficult to lower the variation in the in-control ARL values sufficiently due to practical limitations on the amount of the Phase I data, we recommend an alternative design criterion and a procedure based on the bootstrap approach.","Bootstrap,Estimation Effect,SDARL,SPC,Standard Deviation of Average Run Length,Statistical Process Control","STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,MOVING AVERAGE CHARTS,ESTIMATED CONTROL LIMITS,RUN-LENGTH DISTRIBUTION,X-CONTROL CHARTS,STANDARD-DEVIATION,BOOTSTRAP METHODS,PERFORMANCE,(X)OVER-BAR,SCHEMES","Saleh, Nesma A.@Cairo Univ, Fac Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Stat, Cairo, Egypt::Mahmoud, Mahmoud A.@Cairo Univ, Fac Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Stat, Cairo, Egypt::Jones-Farmer, L.

Statistical Methods for Combining Information: Stryker Family of Vehicles Reliability Case Study,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2015,26,2,"Problem: Reliability is an essential element in assessing the operational suitability of Department of Defense weapon systems. Reliability takes a prominent role in both the design and analysis of operational tests. In the current era of reduced budgets and increased reliability requirements, it is challenging to verify reliability requirements in a single test. Furthermore, all available data should be considered in order to ensure evaluations provide the most appropriate analysis of the system's reliability.

Approach: This paper describes the benefits of using parametric statistical models to combine information across multiple testing events. Both frequentist and Bayesian inference techniques are employed and they are compared and contrasted to illustrate different statistical methods for combining information. We apply these methods to data collected during the developmental and operational test phases for the Stryker family of vehicles.

Results: We show that, when we combine the available information across two test phases for the Stryker family of vehicles, reliability estimates are more accurate and precise than those reported previously using traditional methods that use only operational test data in their reliability assessments.","Combining Information,Defense Acquisition,Exponential Distribution,Reliability,Weibull Distribution","SYSTEM-RELIABILITY,COMPLEX-SYSTEMS,MODELS","Dickinson, Rebecca M.@Inst Def Anal, Alexandria, VA 22311 USA::Freeman, Laura J.@Inst Def Anal, Operat Evaluat Div, Alexandria, VA USA::Simpson, Bruce A.@Inst Def Anal, Alexandria, VA 22311 USA::Wilson, Alyson G.@N Carolina State Univ, Dept Stat, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Dickinson, Rebecca M.@Unknow::Freeman, Laura J.@Unknow::Simpson, Bruce A.@Unknow::Wilson, Alyson G.@North Carolina State University@University of North Carolina","Wilson, Alyson@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1461-6212","Bayesian stockpile reliability methodology for complex systems+Anderson-Cook, Christine M.; Graves, Todd; Hamada, Michael; et al.+MILITARY OPERATIONS RESEARCH+2007::Opportunities and Issues in Multiple Data Type Meta-Analyses+Anderson-Cook, Christine M.+QUALITY ENGINEERING+2009::Expert elicitation for reliable system design+Bedford, Tim; Quigley, John; Walls, Lesley+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+NOV 2006::SCIENCE AND STATISTICS+BOX, GEP+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1976::Practical Approach to Interval Estimation for the Weibull Mean Lifetime+Colosimo, E.

For example, how confident are we that 90% (0.90) of the population does not exceed an upper specification? We show how confidence can be obtained by inverting tolerance bounds. Also, a Bayesian approach can be used to obtain a posterior probability that a specified proportion of the population meets a specification. We consider the single normal population and simple linear regression and nonlinear regression models. We also compare the two methods via a simulation study.","Bayesian,Nonlinear Regression,Normal Distribution,Simple Linear Regression",,"Hamada, M.

I-Optimal Design of Mixture Experiments in the Presence of Ingredient Availability Constraints,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2015,28,1,"Mixture experiments usually involve various constraints on the proportions of the ingredients of the mixture under study. In this paper, inspired by the fact that the available stock of certain ingredients is often limited, we focus on a new type of constraint, which we refer to as an ingredient availability constraint. This type of constraint substantially complicates the search for optimal designs for mixture experiments.

Analysis of Reliability Experiments with Random Blocks and Subsampling,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2015,12,6,"Reliability experiments provide important information regarding the life of an item, including how various factors affect item life. Current analyses of reliability data usually assume a completely randomized design. However, reliability experiments are frequently executed with restrictions on randomization. Common restrictions on randomization include subsampling and blocking. This paper proposes a nonlinear mixed-model analysis for reliability experiments with random blocks and subsampling. A simulation study compares this nonlinear mixed model analysis with a two-stage analysis and traditional reliability analyses.","Nonlinear Mixed Model,Regression with Lifetime Data,Weibull Distribution",MODELS,"Kensler, Jennifer L.

Multivariate Exponentially Weighted Moving-Average Chart for Monitoring Poisson Observations,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2015,42,5,"In many practical situations, multiple variables often need to be monitored simultaneously to ensure the process is in control. In this article, we develop a feasible multivariate monitoring procedure based on the general multivariate exponentially weighted moving average (MEWMA) to monitor the multivariate count data. The multivariate count data is modeled using Poisson log-normal distribution to characterize their interrelations. We systematically investigate the effects of different charting parameters and propose an optimization procedure to identify the optimal charting parameters. In particular, we provide a design table to the quality engineers as a simple tool to design the optimal MEWMA chart. To further improve the efficiency, we integrate the variable sampling intervals (VSI) in the monitoring scheme. We use simulation studies and an example to elicit the application of the proposed scheme. The results are encouraging and demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed methods well.","Count Data,Individual Observation,Multivariate Poisson,Statistical Process Control","STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,VARIABLE SAMPLING INTERVALS,EWMA CONTROL CHARTS,COUNT DATA,CUSUM,VARIANCE,REGRESSION,MODEL,SIZE,SPC","Chen, Nan@Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Singapore 117548, Singapore::Li, Zhonghua@Nankai Univ, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China::Ou, Yanjing@Singapore Inst Mfg Technol, Singapore, Singapore","Chen, Nan@National University of Singapore::Li, Zhonghua@Nankai University::Ou, Yanjing@Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology@Agency for Science Technology & Research (ASTAR)","Chen, Nan@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2495-5234","THE MULTIVARIATE POISSON-LOG NORMAL-DISTRIBUTION+AITCHISON, J; HO, CH+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1989::CUSUM control charts with variable sample sizes and sampling intervals+Arnold, JC; Reynolds, MR+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2001::A bivariate Poisson count data model using conditional probabilities+Berkhout, P; Plug, E+STATISTICA NEERLANDICA+AUG 2004::Multivariate statistical process control charts: An overview+Bersimis, S.; Psarakis, S.; Panaretos, J.+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+AUG 2007::A multivariate Poisson mixture model for marketing applications+Brijs, T; Karlis, D; Swinnen, G; et al.+STATISTICA NEERLANDICA+AUG 2004::Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis of correlated count data+Chib, S; Winkelmann, R+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+OCT 2001::A New Adaptive CUSUM Control Chart for Detecting the Multivariate Process Mean+Dai, Yi; Luo, Yunzhao; Li, Zhonghua; et al.+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+NOV 2011::DOUBLE SAMPLING (X)BAR CHARTS+DAUDIN, JJ+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 1992::THE RUN-LENGTH DISTRIBUTION OF A CUMULATIVE SUM CONTROL CHART+GAN, FF+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1993::A general Multivariate exponentially weighted moving-average control chart+Hawkins, Douglas M.; Choi, Sungwoon; Lee, Sanghoon+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 2007::A Variable-Selection-Based Multivariate EWMA Chart for Process Monitoring and Diagnosis+Jiang, Wei; Wang, Kaibo; Tsung, Fugee+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 2012::An EM algorithm for multivariate Poisson distribution and related models+Karlis, D+JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS+JAN 2003::Multivariate Poisson regression with covariance structure+Karlis, D; Meligkotsidou, L+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+OCT 2005::Directional Change-Point Detection for Process Control with Multivariate Categorical Data+Li, Jian; Tsung, Fugee; Zou, Changliang+NAVAL RESEARCH LOGISTICS+MAR 2013::An exponentially weighted moving average scheme with variable sampling intervals for monitoring linear profiles+Li, Zhonghua; Wang, Zhaojun+COMPUTERS &amp; INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING+NOV 2010::Cusum of Q chart with variable sampling intervals for monitoring the process mean+Li, Zhonghua; Luo, Yunzhao; Wang, Zhaojun+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH+2010::A Multivariate Sign Chart for Monitoring Process Shape Parameters+Li, Zhonghua; Zou, Changliang; Wang, Zhaojun; et al.+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 2013::A MULTIVARIATE EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE CONTROL CHART+LOWRY, CA; WOODALL, WH; CHAMP, CW; et al.+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1992::A Special Variable Sample Size and Sampling Interval [image omitted] Chart+Mahadik, Shashibhushan B.; Shirke, Digambar T.+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2009::no title+Montgomery, D.

A Prediction Interval Estimator for the Original Response When Using Box-Cox Transformations,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2015,18,5,"Motivated by electron microscopy experiments, we develop an approximate prediction interval on the response variable Y, where it is assumed that a normal-theory linear model is fit using a transformed version of Y, and the transformation type is contained in the Box-Cox family. We derive a closed-form approximation to the kth moment of the original response variable Y, which is then used to estimate the mean and variance of Y, given parameter estimates obtained from fitting the model in the transformed domain. Chebychev's inequality is then used to construct a 100(1 - alpha)% prediction-interval estimator on Y. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we assess the width performance of our proposed Chebychev prediction interval, relative to that obtained by employing a more common interval-construction approach. General results suggest that, for a given level of expected coverage, the proposed interval estimator will achieve a smaller mean and variance of the interval width estimates, especially as the number of degrees of freedom beyond that required to estimate model terms is small. We apply our method to two experimental-data sets, one involving a standard 2(k) design and the other involving a 2(k) design with a split-plot error structure.","Data Transformations,Linear Models,Power-Normal Distribution,Prediction Intervals,Transformation Bias","POWER TRANSFORMATION,NORMALITY","Perry, Marcus B.@Univ Alabama, Culverhouse Coll Commerce, Dept Informat Syst Stat & Management Sci, Appl Stat, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA::Walker, Michael L.@Univ Alabama, Culverhouse Coll Commerce, Dept Informat Syst Stat & Management Sci, Appl Stat, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA","Perry, Marcus B.@University of Alabama Tuscaloosa@University of Alabama System::Walker, Michael L.@University of Alabama Tuscaloosa@University of Alabama System",not exist,"AN ANALYSIS OF TRANSFORMATIONS+BOX, GEP; COX, DR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1964::ON PREDICTION AND THE POWER TRANSFORMATION FAMILY+CARROLL, RJ; RUPPERT, D+BIOMETRIKA+1981::no title+Cramer, H.+Random Variables and Probability Distributions+1970::no title+Daniel, C.+Applications of Statistics to Industrial Experimentation+1976::ON DISTRIBUTIONS AND THEIR TRANSFORMATION TO NORMALITY+DRAPER, NR; COX, DR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1969::Inverse Box-Cox: The power-normal distribution+Freeman, J; Modarres, R+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+APR 15 2006::Extending the Box-Cox transformation to the linear mixed model+Gurka, MJ; Edwards, LJ; Muller, KE; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+2006::A reference-free Cuscore chart for dynamic mean change detection and a unified framework for charting performance comparison+Han, D; Tsung, FG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2006::CONFIDENCE INTERVAL ESTIMATION FOR MEANS AFTER DATA TRANSFORMATIONS TO NORMALITY+LAND, CE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1974::REDUCING TRANSFORMATION BIAS IN CURVE FITTING+MILLER, DM+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+1984::no title+Montgomery, DC.+Design and analysis of experiments+2009::Statistical characterization of nanostructured materials from severe plastic deformation in machining+Perry, Marcus B.; Kharoufeh, Jeffrey P.; Shekhar, Shashank; et al.+IIE TRANSACTIONS+2012::no title+Sakia, R.

The Difficulty in Designing Shewhart (X)over-bar and X Control Charts with Estimated Parameters,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2015,39,36,"The performance of the Shewhart (X) over bar control chart with estimated in-control parameters has been discussed a number of times in the literature. Previous studies showed that at least 400/(n - 1) phase I samples, where n > 1 is the sample size, are required so that the chart performs on average as if the in-control process parameter values were known. This recommendation was based on the in-control expected average run length (ARL) performance. The reliance on the expected ARL metric, however, averages across the practitioner-to-practitioner variability. This variability occurs due to the different historical data sets practitioners use, which results in varying parameter estimates, control limits, and in-control ARL values. In our article, we show that taking this type of variability into consideration leads to far larger amounts of phase I data than what was previously recommended. This is to ensure low levels of variation in the in-control ARL values among practitioners. The standard deviation of the ARL (SDARL) metric is used to evaluate performance for various amounts of phase I data. We show that no realistic phase I sample size is sufficient to have confidence that the attained in-control ARL is close to the desired value. We additionally investigate the effect of different process standard deviation estimators on the (X) over bar -chart performance, showing that it is best to use a biased estimator. We also study the design of the X-chart for the case n = 1, drawing similar conclusions regarding the amount of phase I data. An alternative approach to designing control charts is recommended.","Estimation Effect,Phase I,Shewhart Control Chart,Standard Deviation of Average Run Length,SPC,Statistical Process Control","PROCESS STANDARD-DEVIATION,ESTIMATED CONTROL LIMITS,RUN-LENGTH DISTRIBUTION,AUTOCORRELATED PROCESSES,CUSUM CHART,SAMPLE-SIZE,PERFORMANCE","Saleh, Nesma A.@Cairo Univ, Dept Stat, Fac Econ & Polit Sci, Cairo, Egypt::Mahmoud, Mahmoud A.@Cairo Univ, Dept Stat, Fac Econ & Polit Sci, Cairo, Egypt::Keefe, Matthew J.@Virginia Tech, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Woodall, William H.@Virginia Tech, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Saleh, Nesma A.@Cairo University::Mahmoud, Mahmoud A.@Cairo University::Keefe, Matthew J.@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Woodall, William H.@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University",not exist,"Are estimated control charts in control?+Albers, W; Kallenberg, WCM+STATISTICS+FEB 2004::The performance of the multivariate adaptive exponentially weighted moving average control chart with estimated parameters+Aly, AA; Mahmoud, MA; Hamed, R.+Quality and Reliability Engineering International+2015::A Comparison of the Performance of Phase II Simple Linear Profile Control Charts when Parameters are Estimated+Aly, Aya A.; Mahmoud, Mahmoud A.; Woodall, William H.+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+2015::Design of exponentially weighted moving average control charts for autocorrelated processes with model uncertainty+Apley, DW; Lee, HC+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 2003::The rate of false signals in X control charts with estimated limits+Bischak, Diane P.; Trietsch, Dan+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2007::The Variable Sample Size (X)over-bar Chart with Estimated Parameters+Castagliola, Philippe; Zhang, Ying; Costa, Antonio; et al.+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+NOV 2012::Run length, average run length and false alarm rate of Shewhart X-bar chart: Exact derivations by conditioning+Chakraborti, S+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+2000::Parameter estimation and design considerations in prospective applications of the (X)over-bar chart+Chakraborti, S+JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS+MAY 2006::The mean and standard deviation of the run length distribution of (X)over-bar charts when control limits are estimated+Chen, GM+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 1997::Run length distributions and economic design of (X)over-bar charts with unknown process variance+DelCastillo, E+METRIKA+1996::no title+DERMAN C+PROBAB ENG INFORM SC+1995::Effect of the Number and Size of the Phase I Sample on the Phase II Performance of S2 and S Control Charts+Epprecht, E.

Assignable causes and auto correlation: Control charts for observations or residuals?,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2002,18,21,"In many industrial processes, the disturbance generated by an assignable cause Is affected by the same inertial elements as the observations from the common-cause system. In these cases, the manifestation of the assignable cause differs from that in many common models. A control chart based on the observations can be effective for statistical process control, but its success depends on the relationship of the timeseries model produced by the inertial elements to the magnitude of the disturbance in the input. This characterization provides insight into the research that compares charts based on residuals to those based on the raw data.

Monitoring of a batch continuous process using mass re-sampling,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2002,13,6,"An industrial ethylene propylene rubber compounding process is used to illustrate some of the issues that wise in the monitoring of the manufacturing performance of a process comprised of both batch and continuous unit operations. The key issues relate primarily to the different formats of the data that are routinely collected. For example, on batch type processes such as mixers, measurements are collected for a fixed quantity of processed mass. In contrast, for continuous processes such as extruders, data is recorded at fixed time points. Finally, in order to monitor the end product quality this data has to be related to the final product quality measurements that are recorded after a fixed quantity of mass has been produced. This quantity differs from that used for the batch units. Thus, for the development of a manufacturing process performance monitoring scheme, it is necessary to provide a common sampling base. The approach proposed is to re-sample the measurements for a fixed sampling mass. Benefits arising from the proposed methodology include the more traditional advantages of multivariate statistical process control: that is, an enhanced understanding of the process and the early warning of changes in operation. In addition, the proposed approach removes the need to time-align the data.",,"MULTIBLOCK,DIAGNOSIS,PLS","Martin, EB@Newcastle Univ, Dept Engn Math, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England::Bettoni, A@Newcastle Univ, Dept Engn Math, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England::Morris, AJ@Newcastle Univ, Dept Engn Math, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England","Martin, EB@Newcastle University - UK::Bettoni, A@Newcastle University - UK::Morris, AJ@Newcastle University - UK",not exist,"no title+KASKAVELIS E+ADCHEM 2000 INT S AD+2000::Improved process understanding using multiway principal component analysis+Kosanovich, KA; Dahl, KS; Piovoso, MJ+INDUSTRIAL &amp; ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH+JAN 1996::ANALYSIS, MONITORING AND FAULT-DIAGNOSIS OF BATCH PROCESSES USING MULTIBLOCK AND MULTIWAY PLS+KOURTI, T; NOMIKOS, P; MACGREGOR, JF+JOURNAL OF PROCESS CONTROL+AUG 1995::MULTIVARIATE STATISTICAL MONITORING OF PROCESS OPERATING PERFORMANCE+KRESTA, JV; MACGREGOR, JF; MARLIN, TE+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING+FEB 1991::Performance monitoring of a multi-product semi-batch process+Lane, S; Martin, EB; Kooijmans, R; et al.+JOURNAL OF PROCESS CONTROL+FEB 2001::PROCESS MONITORING AND DIAGNOSIS BY MULTIBLOCK PLS METHODS+MACGREGOR, JF; JAECKLE, C; KIPARISSIDES, C; et al.+AICHE JOURNAL+MAY 1994::no title+MACGREGOR JF+IFAC ADCHEM 94 C ADV+1994::Contribution plots: a missing link in multivariate quality control+Miller, P.; Swanson, R.E.; Heckler, C.E.+Applied Mathematics and Computer Science+1998::MULTIVARIATE SPC CHARTS FOR MONITORING BATCH PROCESSES+NOMIKOS, P; MACGREGOR, JF+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1995::no title+Rauwendaal, C.+Polymer Extrusion+1994::MODIFICATION OF CONTROL CHART LIMITS IN PRESENCE OF DATA CORRELATION+VASILOPOULOS, AV; STAMBOULIS, AP+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+1978::A multiblock partial least squares algorithm for investigating complex chemical systems+Wangen, L.

A CUSUM scheme for autocorrelated observations,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2002,30,17,"The cumulative sum (CUSUM) chart is known to be effective at detecting sustained shifts in the process mean. Unfortunately, its performance deteriorates when the process observations are autocorrelated. To eliminate the effect of autocorrelation in monitoring changes in the mean, the CUSUM chart is typically applied on the residuals of the chosen time-series model for the process observations. As an alternative, we develop a CUSUM scheme for detecting a step change in the process mean that directly utilizes the autocorrelated process observations. Analysis shows that the performance of the proposed scheme is very competitive when compared with the Shewhart and CUSUM charts based on residuals.",,"STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,CONTROL CHARTS,CORRELATED OBSERVATIONS,MONITORING SCHEMES,SERIAL CORRELATION,PERFORMANCE,TESTS","Atienza, OO@Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Singapore 117576, Singapore::Tang, LC@Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Singapore 117576, Singapore::Ang, BW@Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Singapore 117576, Singapore","Atienza, OO@National University of Singapore::Tang, LC@National University of Singapore::Ang, BW@National University of Singapore",not exist,"no title+ADAMS BM+FRONTIERS STAT QUALI+1992::Robustness of forecast-based monitoring schemes+Adams, BM; Tseng, IT+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 1998::EFFECTS OF AUTOCORRELATION ON CONTROL CHART PERFORMANCE+ALWAN, LC+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1992::A SPC procedure for detecting level scheme+Atienza, O.

Evaluation of statistical designs for experiments involving noise variables,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2002,45,30,"In process robustness studies, it is desirable to simultaneously minimize the influence of noise factors on the system and to determine the levels of controllable factors that will optimize the overall response or outcome. A methodology for evaluating designed experiments that involve both controllable and uncontrollable, or noise, factors is outlined and presented in this paper. Two variance expressions are developed for evaluating competing experimental design strategies. The maximum, average, and minimum scaled prediction error variances resulting from the models developed are displayed visually on variance dispersion graphs. The scaled prediction error variances account for mean model errors as well as variation transmitted to the process by noise variables.","central composite designs,design of experiments,response surface methodology,robust parameter design","RESPONSE-SURFACE METHODOLOGY,VARIANCE DISPERSION GRAPHS,ROBUST PARAMETER DESIGN,TAGUCHI,OPTIMIZATION,2ND-ORDER,SLOPE","Borror, CM@Arizona State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Montgomery, DC@Arizona State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Myers, RH@Arizona State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Borror, CM@Arizona State University@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Montgomery, DC@Arizona State University@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Myers, RH@Arizona State University@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University",not exist,"Designs of mixed resolution for process robustness studies+Borkowski, JJ; Lucas, JM+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1997::An explanation and critique of Taguchi's contributions to quality engineering+Box, G.; Bisgaard, S.; Fung, C.+Quality and Reliability Engineering International+April-June 1988::SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIOS, PERFORMANCE CRITERIA, AND TRANSFORMATIONS+BOX, G+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1988::no title+Box, G.E.P.; Draper, H.R.+Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces+1987::Discussion of off-line quality control, parameter design, and the Taguchi methods+Box, G.

The nonlinear approach produces intervals even when the classical approach fails to do so. The intervals obtained with the nonlinear approach are always slightly shorter, but the coverage rate remains reasonable, as demonstrated in our simulations. The advantages of the nonlinear approach are that intervals are centered at the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and that they can be obtained using any standard statistical package which contains nonlinear regression methods.","confidence intervals,estimation,inverse regression,least squares",,"Schechtman, E@Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Ind Engn & Management, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel@Texas A&M Univ, Dept Stat, College Stn, TX 77845 USA::Spiegelman, C@Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Ind Engn & Management, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel@Texas A&M Univ, Dept Stat, College Stn, TX 77845 USA","Schechtman, E@Ben Gurion University@Texas A&M University College Station@Texas A&M University System::Spiegelman, C@Ben Gurion University@Texas A&M University College Station@Texas A&M University System","SCHECHTMAN, EDNA@F-1160-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7350-9068","MULTIVARIATE CALIBRATION+BROWN, PJ+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1982::A QUICK AND EASY MULTIPLE-USE CALIBRATION-CURVE PROCEDURE+CARROLL, RJ; SPIEGELMAN, CH; SACKS, J+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 1988::CALIBRATION, CROSS-VALIDATION AND C-14 .2.+CLARK, RM+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1980::CALIBRATION, CROSS-VALIDATION AND C-14 .1.+CLARK, RM+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1979::no title+CURRIE LA+176 AM CHEM SOC+1982::MODIFIED CLASSICAL AND INVERSE REGRESSION-ESTIMATORS IN CALIBRATION+DAHIYA, RC; MCKEON, JJ+SANKHYA-THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS SERIES B+APR 1991::The interpretation of certain regression methods and their use in biological and industrial research+Eisenhart, C+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1939::no title+Graybill, FA.+Theory and application of the linear model+1976::A BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS OF THE LINEAR CALIBRATION-PROBLEM+HUNTER, WG; LAMBOY, WF+TECHNOMETRICS+1981::RADIOCARBON CALIBRATION DATA FOR THE 6TH TO THE 8TH MILLENNIA BC+KROMER, B; RHEIN, M; BRUNS, M; et al.+RADIOCARBON+1986::CLASSICAL AND INVERSE REGRESSION METHODS OF CALIBRATION+KRUTCHKOFF, RG+TECHNOMETRICS+1967::UNLIMITED SIMULTANEOUS DISCRIMINATION INTERVALS IN REGRESSION+LIEBERMAN, GJ; MILLER, RG; HAMILTON, MA+BIOMETRIKA+1967::ELIMINATION OF BIAS IN COURSE OF CALIBRATION+NASZODI, LJ+TECHNOMETRICS+1978::STATISTICAL CALIBRATION - A REVIEW+OSBORNE, C+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+DEC 1991::Interval estimate for the X-intercept of a straight line: A nonlinear approach+Schechtman, E; Spiegelman, C; Moran, N+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+1998::STATISTICAL-THEORY OF CALIBRATION+SCHEFFE, H+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1973::COMPARISON OF THE INVERSE ESTIMATOR WITH THE CLASSICAL ESTIMATOR SUBJECT TO A PRELIMINARY TEST IN LINEAR CALIBRATION+SHUKLA, GK; DATTA, P+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+1985::PROBLEM OF CALIBRATION+SHUKLA, GK+TECHNOMETRICS+1972"
The autoregressive T-2 chart for monitoring univariate autocorrelated processes,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2002,27,52,"In this paper we investigate the autoregressive T-2 control chart for statistical process control of autocorrelated processes. The method involves the monitoring, using Hotelling's T-2 statistic, of a vector formed from a moving window of observations of the univariate autocorrelated process, It is shown that the T-2 statistic can be decomposed into the sum of the squares of the residual errors for various order autoregressive time series models fit to the process data, Guidelines for designing the autoregressive T-2 chart are presented, and its performance is compared to that of residual-based CUSUM and Shewhart individual control charts. The autoregressive T-2 chart has a number of characteristics, including some level of robustness with respect to modeling errors, that make it an attractive alternative to residual-based control charts for autocorrelated processes.","autocorrelation,hotelling's T-2 statistic,statistical process control,time series analysis","STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,QUALITY-CONTROL,SCHEMES","Apley, DW@Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ind Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA@Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Engn Management, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China::Tsung, F@Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ind Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA@Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Engn Management, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Apley, DW@Texas A&M University System@Texas A&M University College Station@Hong Kong University of Science & Technology::Tsung, F@Texas A&M University System@Texas A&M University College Station@Hong Kong University of Science & Technology","Apley, Daniel@B-7454-2009","Robustness of forecast-based monitoring schemes+Adams, BM; Tseng, IT+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 1998::Monitoring autocorrelated processes using multivariate quality control charts+Alwan, AJ; Alwan, LC.+P DEC SCI I ANN M+1994::TIME-SERIES MODELING FOR STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL+ALWAN, LC; ROBERTS, HV+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JAN 1988::The GLRT for statistical process control of autocorrelated processes+Apley, DW; Shi, J+IIE TRANSACTIONS+SEP 1999::MONITORING SEWAGE-TREATMENT PLANTS - SOME QUALITY-CONTROL ASPECTS+BERTHOUEX, PM; HUNTER, WG; PALLESEN, L+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+1978::no title+BOX G+TIME SERIES ANAL+1994::Phase I analysis for autocorrelated processes+Boyles, RA+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 2000::no title+CHOW MC+P 1979 ANN REL MAINT+1979::QUALITY MONITORING OF CONTINUOUS-FLOW PROCESSES+ENGLISH, JR; KRISHNAMURTHI, M; SASTRI, T+COMPUTERS &amp; INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING+1991::REGRESSION ADJUSTMENT FOR VARIABLES IN MULTIVARIATE QUALITY-CONTROL+HAWKINS, DM+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1993::EFFECT OF SERIAL CORRELATION ON PERFORMANCE OF CUSUM TESTS+JOHNSON, RA; BAGSHAW, M+TECHNOMETRICS+1974::Monitoring an Autocorrelated Process+Krieger, C.

Discrete predictive analysis in probabilistic safety assessment,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2002,31,4,"This paper presents methods for predicting future numbers of component failures for probabilistic safety assessments (PSAs). The research is motivated and illustrated by discrete failure data from the nuclear industry, including failure counts for emergency diesel generators, pumps, and motor operated valves. Failure counts are modeled with Poisson and binomial distributions. Multiple-failure environments create extra problems for predictive inference, and are a primary focus of this paper. Common cause failures (CCFs), in particular, refer to the simultaneous failure of system components due to an external event.

Comparing curves using additive models,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2002,20,92,"Advances in technology have increased dramatically the amount of data measured in industrial processes. Thousands of measurements are often available in operations where previously only a single measurement, at a given point in time or space, was taken. These measurements allow the reconstruction of the whole profile or ""signature"" of the operation over time or space. Examples are the tonnage applied in a stamping press during a stroke and the density profile of particleboard. Many of these signatures have complicated forms that are not well modeled with parametric models. In this paper, a relatively new class of models called additive models is used to assess the sources of variation active on these signatures. The models used contain a nonparametric or smooth portion to model the form of the signature, and a parametric portion to incorporate other sources of variation. A table is developed to assess the magnitude of the sources of variation. These techniques are illustrated using density profiles of engineered wood boards.

Six Sigma Black Belts: What do they need to know?,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2001,28,71,"The Six Sigma improvement methodology has received considerable attention recently, not only in the statistical and quality literature, but also within general business literature. In published discussions, terms such as ""Black Belt""(BB), ""Master Black Belt,"" and ""Green Belt"" have frequently been used indiscriminately, without any operational definitions provided. It may not be clear to readers exactly what a ""Black Belt"" is, what training he/she should have, and what skills he/she should possess. Those hiring ""Black Belts"" may also be confused. The discussants and I have a significant opportunity to clarify how statisticians, quality professionals, and business leaders think about Six Sigma, and quality improvement in general. The specific purpose of this article is to provide a context and forum for discussion of the technical skills required by Six Sigma BBs, with the hope of reaching a general consensus. I focus on BBs since they are typically the backbone of Six Sigma initiatives. Some previously published examples of BB curricula will be referenced, while additional input will come from my experience in various areas of GE, as well as recent general trends in applied statistics. I then present a recommended BB curriculum, and compare it to the Certified Quality Engineer (CQE) criteria. Other relevant issues in developing BBs are also discussed.","Black Belt,Certified Quality Engineer,Master Black Belt",6-SIGMA,"Hoerl, RW@GE Co, Corp Res & Dev, Appl Stat Grp, Schenectady, NY 12301 USA","Hoerl, RW@General Electric",not exist,"no title+AGRAWAL R+P SECT PHYS ENG SCI+1999::no title+*AUT IND ACT GROUP+MEAS SYST AN REF MAN+1990::no title+*AUT IND ACT GROUP+POT FAIL MOD EFF AN+1995::no title+*AUT IND ACT GROUP+STAT PROC CONTR REF+1995::no title+BOX G+TIME SERIES ANAL+1994::no title+Box, G.

Optimal split-plot designs,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2001,20,59,"Cost considerations and difficulties in performing completely randomized experiments often dictate the necessity of running response surface experiments in a split-plot format. The resulting compound symmetric error structure not only affects estimation and inference procedures but also has severe consequences for the optimality of the designs used. For this reason, the error structure has to be taken into account explicitly when constructing the design. In this paper, an exchange algorithm for constructing D-optimal split-plot designs is developed and the resulting designs are analyzed. Computational results show that substantial efficiency gains can be realized.","design of experiments,D-optimality,bi-randomization designs,split-plot designs","RESPONSE-SURFACE DESIGNS,CONSTRUCTION","Goos, P@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Appl Econ, Louvain, Belgium::Vandebroek, M@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Appl Econ, Louvain, Belgium","Goos, P@KU Leuven::Vandebroek, M@KU Leuven","Vandebroek, Martina@J-9103-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0317-1986","no title+Anderson, V.

In this paper, we consider experiments with correlated multiple responses whose means, variances, and correlations depend on experimental factors. Analysis of these experiments consists of modeling distributional parameters in terms of the experimental factors and finding factor settings which maximize the probability of being in a specification region, i.e., all responses are simultaneously meeting their respective specifications.

Discussions of necessary adaptations, such as in the formulas for computing the statistic and its distribution, are included. In a Phase I operation, where the focus is on detecting and removing outliers, consideration is given to batch processes where the batch observations are taken from either a common multivariate normal distribution or a series of multivariate normal distributions with different mean vectors. In a Phase II operation, where the monitoring of future observations is of primary concern, emphasis is placed on the application of the T-2 statistic using a known or estimated in-control mean vector.

A bounded intensity process for the reliability of repairable equipment,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2001,15,39,"In the failure pattern of repairable equipment subjected to reliability deterioration with operating time, the repeated application of the repair actions sometimes produces a finite bound for the increasing failure intensity. In this paper, a non-homogeneous Poisson process for which the failure intensity is an increasing bounded function is proposed. The characteristics of the proposed model and the physical meaning of its parameters are discussed. It is shown that the proposed model evolves initially as the power law process with shape parameter equal to 2, and then converges asymptotically to the homogeneous Poisson process, the latter being a limiting form of the proposed bounded intensity model. Maximum likelihood estimates and approximate confidence intervals for the model parameters are given as well as a testing procedure for a time trend. Percentile points of the test statistic are computed by simulation for failure truncated samples, and the power of the proposed testing procedure is evaluated and compared to that of two commonly used tests. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate the proposed model and related inference and testing procedures.","Poisson process,reliability,repairable systems","POWER-LAW PROCESS,SYSTEMS,TESTS,TIME","Pulcini, G@CNR, Ist Motori, I-80125 Naples, Italy","Pulcini, G@Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR)@Istituto Motori (IM-CNR)","Pulcini, Gianpaolo@H-2886-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5474-7095","Estimating parameters of the power law process with two measures of failure time+Ahn, CW; Chae, EC; Clark, GM+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 1998::no title+Ascher, H; Feingold, H.+Repairable systems reliability+1984::Reliability models for repairable systems+Ascher, H.E.+Reliability Technology: Theory and Applications.

Acceptance sampling with rectification when inspection errors are present,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2001,10,1,In this paper we consider the problem of estimating the number of nonconformances remaining in outgoing lots after acceptance sampling with rectification when inspection errors can occur. We show that inspection errors can have a serious biasing effect on the predictor that Greenberg and Stokes (1992) propose for the number of undetected nonconformances. We develop a new bias-corrected predictor of this quantity. A simulation study shows that this predictor performs well with respect to mean square error under a wide range of scenarios.

The optimum target value under single and two-stage screenings,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2001,16,35,"In this paper we consider the problem of determining the optimum target value of the quality characteristic of interest and the screening limits for a correlated variable under single and two-stage screenings. In single-stage screening, inspection is performed directly on the quality characteristic of interest or on a variable that is correlated with the characteristic. In two-stage screening, the correlated variable is inspected first to decide if an item should be accepted, rejected, or whether additional observations should be taken. If additional observations are required, the quality characteristic is then directly observed in order to classify the undecided items. Models are constructed that involve selling and discounted prices as well as production, inspection, and penalty costs for both single and two-stage screenings. Methods for finding the optimum process mean and the screening limits are presented when the quality characteristic and the correlated variable are assumed to be jointly normally distributed. A numerical example is presented.","correlated data,optimum target value,screening","INSPECTION,SELECTION,QUALITY,LEVEL","Lee, MK@Inje Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Kyongnam 621749, South Korea@Chonbuk Natl Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Chonju 561756, Chonbuk, South Korea@Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA::Hong, SH@Inje Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Kyongnam 621749, South Korea@Chonbuk Natl Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Chonju 561756, Chonbuk, South Korea@Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA::Elsayed, EA@Inje Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Kyongnam 621749, South Korea@Chonbuk Natl Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Chonju 561756, Chonbuk, South Korea@Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA","Lee, MK@Inje University@Chonbuk National University@Rutgers State University New Brunswick::Hong, SH@Inje University@Chonbuk National University@Rutgers State University New Brunswick::Elsayed, EA@Inje University@Chonbuk National University@Rutgers State University New Brunswick","Elsayed, Elsayed@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4872-5679","An algorithm for the determination of the optimal target values for two machines in series with quality sampling plans+Al-Sultan, K.

Examples of designed experiments with nonnormal responses,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2001,23,25,"Many industrial experiments involve nonnormal response variables. Generalized linear models (GLM) are a useful alternative to the traditional methods for analyzing such data based on transformations. In this paper we present several examples of designed experiments with nonnormal responses. For each example, models are built using classical least squares methods applied to the appropriately transformed data and models are also built using the GLM. The models are compared by examining the length of the confidence interval about the mean response stated in original units.

Confidence interval coverage for designed experiments analyzed with GLMs,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2001,9,15,"There are many industrial experiments where the response variable is nonnormal. Traditionally, variance-stabilizing transformations are made on such a response in order to obtain properties needed to use ordinary least squares and analysis of variance. Generalized linear models (GLMs) offer a powerful alternative to data transformation. Specifically, the performance in response estimation and prediction for a GLM is often superior to the model built using data transformations. The confidence interval constructed around the estimate of the mean for each experimental run provides the experimenter with critical information about model quality. In generalized linear models, confidence intervals are based on asymptotic theory. As such, they are regarded as statistically valid only for large samples. Therefore, in order to use confidence intervals to compare models. it is essential to evaluate these asymptotic intervals in terms of coverage for sample sizes typically encountered in designed industrial experiments. This paper uses Monte Carte methods to investigate the coverage of confidence intervals for the GLM for factorial experiments with 8, 16, and 32 runs.","design of experiments,generalized linear models,nonconstant variance,nonnormality",,"Lewis, SL@Arizona State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Montgomery, DC@Arizona State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Myers, RH@Arizona State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Lewis, SL@Arizona State University@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Montgomery, DC@Arizona State University@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Myers, RH@Arizona State University@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University",not exist,"Examples of designed experiments with nonnormal responses+Lewis, SL; Montgomery, DC; Myers, RH+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 2001::no title+LEWIS SL+THESIS ARIZOAN STATE+1998::no title+McCullagh, P.; Nelder, J.

Cusum charts for monitoring an autocorrelated process,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2001,26,71,"Control charts for process monitoring have traditionally been designed and evaluated under the assumption that observations on the process output at different times are independent. However, autocorrelation may be present in many processes, and may have a strong impact on the properties of control charts. This paper investigates CUSUM control charts for monitoring the process mean for the situation in which observations from the process can be modeled as an AR(1) process plus an additional random error. CUSUM charts based on plotting the residuals from model forecasts, or on plotting the original observations, are considered. CUSUM charts based on the original observations perform as well as CUSUM charts of residuals, except in the case in which the level of autocorrelation is high and the shift in the process mean is large. A method for designing the CUSUM chart of the observations in the presence of autocorrelation is given. The CUSUM charts are compared to Shewhart and EWMA charts based on the residuals or on the original observations.

Detecting over rejection in testing of integrated circuits,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2001,7,0,"In parallel testing of integrated circuits (IC's), IC's which are conforming in terms of electrical functionality are sometimes incorrectly rejected. This is commonly known as over rejection. Over rejection is due to faulty sockets or failed components of the test hardware system associated with the socket locations. In this paper we propose a two-stage procedure for monitoring socket locations causing an over rejection: in stage one, a binomial test of proportions is used to identify socket locations which are causing an over rejection; in stage two, a cumulative sum scheme is used to monitor the socket locations to detect possible failures of components of the test hardware system. Detection of faulty sockets or failed components results in a reduction of rejected conforming IC's. A simple method is provided for the design of such a procedure. Formulas are also provided which allow the performance of the scheme to be evaluated. An application of the procedure in parallel testing of IC's is performed. A follow up study is conducted to determine practical problems with the procedure and to find solutions.","Bernoulli distribution,binomial distribution,cumulative sum control charts,statistical process control",,"Chang, TC@Infineon Technol Integrated Circuits, Melaka 75914, Malaysia@Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Stat & Appl Probabil, Singapore 117543, Singapore::Gan, FF@Infineon Technol Integrated Circuits, Melaka 75914, Malaysia@Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Stat & Appl Probabil, Singapore 117543, Singapore","Chang, TC@Unknow@National University of Singapore::Gan, FF@Unknow@National University of Singapore",not exist,"APPROACH TO PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION OF CUSUM RUN LENGTH+BROOK, D; EVANS, DA+BIOMETRIKA+1972::CONTROL SCHEMES FOR LOW COUNT LEVELS+LUCAS, JM+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1989::no title+Mood, A.; Graybill, F.; Boes, D.+Introduction to the Theory of Statistics+1974::OPTIMAL STOPPING-TIMES FOR DETECTING CHANGES IN DISTRIBUTIONS+MOUSTAKIDES, GV+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1986::CONTROL CHARTS WITH WARNING LINES+PAGE, ES+BIOMETRIKA+1955::A discrete Markov chain representation of the sequential probability ratio test+Woodal, W.

Joint estimation: SPC method for short-run autocorrelated data,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2001,48,24,"In this paper we investigate the use of the joint estimation (JE) outlier detection method as a statistical process control method for short-run autocorrelated data. Because JE is able to differentiate between four different outlier tout-of-control observation) types, performance is reported with respect to its ability to locate the out-of-control observation and identify the associated type. This is of particular interest to practitioners because the four different types may indicate different problems in the process. The results show that JE performs better for AR(1) models when the out-of-control observation is the last observation than for MA(1) models. However, JE is better able to distinguish between the four outlier types for MA(1) models than for AR(1) models.

We derive an exact relationship between location and dispersion effects, and we show that without information in addition to the unreplicated fractional factorial (such as replication) we can not determine whether a dispersion effect or two location effects are active.","confounding,dispersion,fractional factorial designs,scale parameter",DESIGNS,"McGrath, RN@Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Operat Res & Appl Stat, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA@Penn State Univ, Dept Management Sci & Informat Syst, University Pk, PA 16802 USA@Penn State Univ, Dept Stat, University Pk, PA 16802 USA::Lin, DKJ@Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Operat Res & Appl Stat, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA@Penn State Univ, Dept Management Sci & Informat Syst, University Pk, PA 16802 USA@Penn State Univ, Dept Stat, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","McGrath, RN@Bowling Green State University@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University::Lin, DKJ@Bowling Green State University@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University",not exist,"Dispersion effects from unreplicated designs in the 2(k-p) series+Bergman, B; Hynen, A+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 1997::no title+BOX GEP+STAT EXPT+1978::AN ANALYSIS FOR UNREPLICATED FRACTIONAL FACTORIALS+BOX, GEP; MEYER, RD+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1986::DISPERSION EFFECTS FROM FRACTIONAL DESIGNS+BOX, GEP; MEYER, RD+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1986::no title+DANIEL C+APPL STAT IND EXPT+1978::Use of half-normal plots in interpreting factorial two level experiments+Daniel, C.+Technometrics+1959::VARIANCE FUNCTION ESTIMATION+DAVIDIAN, M; CARROLL, RJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1987::SMALL SAMPLES ESTIMATION OF DISPERSION EFFECTS FROM UNREPLICATED DATA+FERRER, AJ; ROMERO, R+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+1993::no title+FERRER AJ+QUALITY ENG+1993::SOME TESTS FOR HOMOSCEDASTICITY+GOLDFELD, SM; QUANDT, RE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1965::Analyzing unreplicated factorial experiments: A review with some new proposals+Hamada, M; Balakrishnan, N+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 1998::A SIMPLE METHOD TO IDENTIFY SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS IN UNREPLICATED 2-LEVEL FACTORIAL-DESIGNS+JUAN, J; PENA, D+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1992::QUICK AND EASY ANALYSIS OF UNREPLICATED FACTORIALS+LENTH, RV+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1989::Using factional factorial designs for robust process developments+Montgomery, DC.+Qual Eng+1991::ANALYZING DISPERSION EFFECTS FROM REPLICATED FACTORIAL-EXPERIMENTS+NAIR, VN; PREGIBON, D+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 1988::no title+TAGUCHI G+INTRO OFFLINE QUALIT+1980::TESTS FOR DISPERSION EFFECTS FROM ORTHOGONAL ARRAYS+WANG, PC+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+MAY 1989::A step-down Lenth method for analyzing unreplicated factorial designs+Ye, KQ; Hamada, M; Wu, CFJ+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 2001"
A step-down Lenth method for analyzing unreplicated factorial designs,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2001,11,24,"Unreplicated factorial designs are frequently used in industrial experiments. A commonly used method to identify active effects from such experiments is the half-normal plot. Many formal testing methods have been developed to overcome the subjectivity of using this graphical method. Among them, the Lenth (1989) method is simple, yet powerful, as shown by Hamada and Balakrishnan (1998). In this paper, we propose a step-down version of the Lenth method.

It is compared via simulation with the original Lenth method and with stepwise methods proposed by Venter and Steel (1998). It is shown that the step-down Lenth method is better than the original Lenth method and the Venter and Steel step-down method. The Venter and Steel step-up method controlled by the same experimentwise error rate has more power, but it also has a higher individual error rate. Critical values used in the step-down Lenth method are provided.","experimentwise error rate,individual error rate,power",,"Ye, KQ@SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Appl Math & Stat, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA@Univ Calif Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA@Univ Michigan, Dept Stat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA@Univ Michigan, Dept Ind & Operat Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA::Hamada, M@SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Appl Math & Stat, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA@Univ Calif Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA@Univ Michigan, Dept Stat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA@Univ Michigan, Dept Ind & Operat Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA::Wu, CFJ@SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Appl Math & Stat, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA@Univ Calif Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA@Univ Michigan, Dept Stat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA@Univ Michigan, Dept Ind & Operat Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Ye, KQ@State University of New York (SUNY) System@State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook@Los Alamos National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan@University of Michigan@University of Michigan System::Hamada, M@State University of New York (SUNY) System@State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook@Los Alamos National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan@University of Michigan@University of Michigan System::Wu, CFJ@State University of New York (SUNY) System@State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook@Los Alamos National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan@University of Michigan@University of Michigan System",not exist,"Use of half-normal plots in interpreting factorial two level experiments+Daniel, C.+Technometrics+1959::Analyzing unreplicated factorial experiments: A review with some new proposals+Hamada, M; Balakrishnan, N+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 1998::QUICK AND EASY ANALYSIS OF UNREPLICATED FACTORIALS+LENTH, RV+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1989::Calibration of the Lenth test for unreplicated factorial designs+Loughin, TM+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 1998::Confounding of location and dispersion effects in unreplicated fractional factorials+McGrath, RN; Lin, DKJ+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 2001::no title+Montgomery, D.

Some properties of EWMA feedback quality adjustment schemes for drifting disturbances,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2001,22,30,"Control schemes that are simple enough for operators to implement and that are robust with respect to the underlying model assumptions are usually sought in the area of process adjustment. In the last few years, process adjustment schemes based on the Exponentially-Weighted-Moving-Average (EWMA) statistic have gained popularity in the manufacturing of semiconductors. In the literature, the analysis of this type of adjustment technique has concentrated on a single EWMA controller applied to a system that experiences a deterministic trend disturbance. Although other types of drift models can provide a better description of the disturbance, the performance analysis of EWMA controllers under such conditions has not been undertaken in the past. In this paper we present practical stability and robustness results for single and double EWMA controllers under a variety of process disturbances acting on a ""responsive"" system. Drift disturbances considered include a random walk with drift, IMA(1,1), and an ARMA disturbance with drift. The effects of errors in the model gain estimate are studied for single EWMA controllers applied to these disturbances. The optimal weight parameter of a single EWMA controller is derived for the case of a random walk with drift disturbance.

Understanding the influence of several factors on a cylindrical response,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2001,7,2,Understanding the influence of several input factors on the relationship between bivariate responses with one directional and one linear component is an important part of some industrial applications and has not been considered often in the literature. A model based on the C-linear form suggested by Mardia and Sutton (1978) for factorial designs with a cylindrical response is presented. A strategy adapted from backwards stepwise regression is also given for obtaining a parsimonious model to highlight numerically and graphically the main and interaction effects. The proposed method is used to analyze data from an experiment involving the balancing of automotive flywheels.,"circular-linear data,directional data,factorial designs",,"Anderson-Cook, CM@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Anderson-Cook, CM@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University",not exist,"no title+ANDERSON CM+APPL STAT-J ROY ST C+1996::A tutorial on one-way analysis of circular-linear data+Anderson-Cook, CM+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 1999::Asymptotics for the SIMEX estimator in nonlinear measurement error models+Carroll, RJ; Kuchenhoff, H; Lombard, F; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1996::ROBUST LOCALLY WEIGHTED REGRESSION AND SMOOTHING SCATTERPLOTS+CLEVELAND, WS+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1979::no title+Fisher, N.

Monitoring the process mean and variance using individual observations and variable sampling intervals,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2001,33,108,In this paper we investigate control charts for monitoring a process to detect changes in the mean and/or variance of a normal quality variable when an individual observation is taken at each sampling point. The traditional X chart and moving range (MR) chart are evaluated. Also evaluated are the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) chart of the observations and the EWMA chart of the squared deviations of the observations from the target. It is shown that the combination of the X and MR charts will not detect small and moderate parameter shifts as fast as combinations involving the EWMA charts. The ability of charts to diagnose the type of parameter shift produced by a special cause is also investigated. It is shown that combinations involving the EWMA charts are just as effective at diagnosing the type of parameter shift as the traditional combination of the X and MR charts. The effect of adding the variable sampling interval (VSI) feature is also evaluated for some of the combinations of charts. The VSI feature allows the sampling interval to be varied as a function of the values of the statistics being plotted. it is shown that adding the VSI feature to the combinations of charts results in very substantial reductions in the expected time required to detect shifts in process parameters.,"average number of observations to signal,average time to signal,exponentially weighted moving average control charts,moving range control charts,Shewhart control charts,statistical process control,steady state,variable sampling interval control charts,X control charts","AVERAGE CONTROL SCHEMES,RANGE CONTROL CHARTS,FIXED TIMES,SHEWHART,ENHANCEMENTS,DESIGN","Reynolds, MR@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Forestry, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA@Rutgers State Univ, Dept Management Sci & Informat Syst, Newark, NJ 07102 USA::Stoumbos, ZG@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Forestry, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA@Rutgers State Univ, Dept Management Sci & Informat Syst, Newark, NJ 07102 USA","Reynolds, MR@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University@Rutgers State University New Brunswick@Rutgers State University Newark::Stoumbos, ZG@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University@Rutgers State University New Brunswick@Rutgers State University Newark",not exist,"An X and EWMA chart for individual observations+Albin, SL; Kang, L; Shea, G+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 1997::A note on individual and moving range control charts+Amin, RW; Ethridge, RA+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 1998::AN APPLICATION OF VARIABLE SAMPLING INTERVAL CONTROL CHARTS+BAXLEY, RV+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 1995::no title+CHENGULAR IN+COMMUNICATIONS STAT+1993::A program for retrospective change-point analysis of individual observations+Cleveland, CD; Sullivan, JH; Batson, RG; et al.+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 2001::SOME OMNIBUS EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE STATISTICAL PROCESS MONITORING SCHEMES+DOMANGUE, R; PATCH, SC+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 1991::JOINT MONITORING OF PROCESS MEAN AND VARIANCE USING EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE CONTROL CHARTS+GAN, FF+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1995::EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE CONTROL SCHEMES - PROPERTIES AND ENHANCEMENTS+LUCAS, JM; SACCUCCI, MS+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1990::THE EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING VARIANCE+MACGREGOR, JF; HARRIS, TJ+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 1993::CONTROL CHARTS FOR INDIVIDUAL MEASUREMENTS+NELSON, LS+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+1982::Economic design of a variable sampling rate (X)over-bar chart+Park, C; Reynolds, MR+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 1999::Optimal variable sampling interval control charts+Reynolds Jr, M.

On estimating (X)over-bar control chart limits,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2001,7,35,"In this paper we address the issue of estimating the Shewhart (X) over bar control chart limits when the values of the process parameters are not known. Recently it has been shown that in order for the estimated control limits to perform similarly to the true, but unknown, limits, they should be based on data from at least 400/(n - 1) subgroups. where n denotes the subgroup size. In this paper. we propose an approach for constructing control limits that attempt to match any specific percentile point of run length distribution of the true limits, even when the limits are estimated using data from only a few subgroups. This approach would enable the user to start monitoring the process with an (X) over bar control chart at an earlier stage than would be possible with the standard approach. We compare the performance of the proposed approach with that of the standard approach through Monte Carlo simulation experiments. The simulation results show that the control limits constructed using our proposed method perform similarly to the true limits even when estimated from a small number of subgroups.","average run length,control charts,control limits,Monte Carlo simulation,multivariate t distribution,run length distributions,statistical process control",,"Nedumaran, G@SAS Inst Inc, Cary, NC 27513 USA@Florida A&M Univ, Florida State Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Ind Engn, Tallahassee, FL 32310 USA::Pignatiello, JJ@SAS Inst Inc, Cary, NC 27513 USA@Florida A&M Univ, Florida State Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Ind Engn, Tallahassee, FL 32310 USA","Nedumaran, G@Unknow@Florida State University@State University System of Florida@Florida A&M University::Pignatiello, JJ@Unknow@Florida State University@State University System of Florida@Florida A&M University",not exist,"no title+BECHHOFER RE+SELECTED TABLES MATH+1988::X and R Chart Control Limits Based on a Small Number of Subgroups+Hiller, F.

Effect of measurement error on Shewhart control charts,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2001,13,47,"Significant measurement error often exists in quality control applications. Measurement error is known to result in reduced power to detect a given change in the mean or variance of a quality characteristic. There are often several available measurement techniques, among which one yields the greatest power per measurement to detect process shifts. The effect of measurement error on the performance of (X) over bar and S-2 charts using a linear covariate is investigated. One of the effects of measurement error is a loss of power in detecting parameter shifts in the underlying process variable. In the presence of measurement error. it may be desirable to take multiple measurements for each of the items in a subgroup. Conditions under which multiple measurements are desirable are identified, and a cost model is suggested for selection of an optimal sampling plan. A model involving measurement error variance that is a linearly increasing function of the process mean is also investigated.","control charts,measurement error",,"Linna, KW@Auburn Univ, Montgomery, AL 36124 USA@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Woodall, WH@Auburn Univ, Montgomery, AL 36124 USA@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Linna, KW@Unknow@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Woodall, WH@Unknow@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University","Woodall, William@A-8094-2009","no title+ABRAHAM B+ANN TECHN C AM SOC Q+1977::Effect of measurement error on chemical process control+Bennett, C.

A program for retrospective change-point analysis of individual observations,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2001,8,7,"In the retrospective (preliminary) analysis of individual observations collected over time, the in-control parameters of the process are unknown, and there is the possibility of a shift in the mean or standard deviation at any point in the observations, in many cases a special cause of variation will produce a single, sustained shift in the mean, standard deviation, or both. Presented here is a FORTRAN program for detecting such shifts, developed from a likelihood ratio test under the assumption of normality. The advantages over use of the standard X- chart and moving range chart are much higher probabilities of detection of sustained shifts and much improved diagnostic information. When a shift is detected, the most likely location is given, as well as whether it is primarily due to a shift in the mean, standard deviation, or both. Multiple shifts can often be detected by recursive application of the algorithm under the user's direction. The program calculates an approximate upper control limit, using an expression that is determined from simulation by Sullivan and Woodall (1996). Alternatively, the user can provide the desired upper control limit.","change point,maximum likelihood,moving range control charts,X control charts",CONTROL CHARTS,"Cleveland, CD@Amer Management Syst Inc, Birmingham, AL 35244 USA@Mississippi State Univ, Coll Business & Ind, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA@Univ Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Sullivan, JH@Amer Management Syst Inc, Birmingham, AL 35244 USA@Mississippi State Univ, Coll Business & Ind, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA@Univ Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Batson, RG@Amer Management Syst Inc, Birmingham, AL 35244 USA@Mississippi State Univ, Coll Business & Ind, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA@Univ Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Woodall, WH@Amer Management Syst Inc, Birmingham, AL 35244 USA@Mississippi State Univ, Coll Business & Ind, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA@Univ Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Cleveland, CD@Unknow@Mississippi State University@University of Alabama System@University of Alabama Tuscaloosa@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Sullivan, JH@Unknow@Mississippi State University@University of Alabama System@University of Alabama Tuscaloosa@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Batson, RG@Unknow@Mississippi State University@University of Alabama System@University of Alabama Tuscaloosa@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Woodall, WH@Unknow@Mississippi State University@University of Alabama System@University of Alabama Tuscaloosa@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University","Woodall, William@A-8094-2009","no title+Montgomery, DC.+Introduction to statistical quality control Hoboken+1996::CONTROL CHARTS FOR INDIVIDUAL MEASUREMENTS+NELSON, LS+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+1982::DESIGN STRATEGIES FOR INDIVIDUALS AND MOVING RANGE CONTROL CHARTS+RIGDON, SE; CRUTHIS, EN; CHAMP, CW+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 1994::SHEWHART-TYPE CONTROL CHARTS FOR INDIVIDUAL OBSERVATIONS+ROES, KCB; DOES, RJMM; SCHURINK, Y+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1993::no title+Ryan, T.

Design issues in fractional factorial split-plot experiments,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2001,10,57,"It is often impractical to perform the experimental runs of a fractional factorial in a completely random order. In these cases, restrictions on the randomization of the experimental trials are imposed and the design is said to have a split-plot structure. Similar to fractional factorials, the ""goodness"" of fractional factorial split-plot designs can be judged using the minimum aberration criterion. However, the split-plot nature of the design implies that not all factorial effects can be estimated with the same precision. In this paper, we discuss the impact of the randomization restrictions on the design. We show how the split-plot structure affects estimation, precision, and the use of resources. We demonstrate how these issues affect design selection in a real industrial experiment.","minimum aberration,precision,resolution",2-LEVEL,"Bingham, DR@Univ Michigan, Dept Stat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA@Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada::Sitter, RR@Univ Michigan, Dept Stat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA@Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada","Bingham, DR@University of Michigan@University of Michigan System@Simon Fraser University::Sitter, RR@University of Michigan@University of Michigan System@Simon Fraser University",not exist,"Minimum-aberration two-level fractional factorial split-plot designs+Bingham, D; Sitter, RR+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1999::The design and analysis of 2(k-p) x 2(q-r) split plot experiments+Bisgaard, S+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2000::Split-plot designs for robust product experimentation+Box, G.

Bayesian inference for some mixture problems in quality and reliability,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2001,20,11,"This is an expository paper dealing with Bayesian inference for three important mixture problems in quality and reliability. The traditional approach for estimation in these situations is the method of maximum likelihood. The corresponding inference based on large-sample theory can, however, be misleading in situations where the large-sample normal approximation is not adequate. The Bayesian approach, on the other hand, has been viewed as computationally intractable due to the complex nature of mixture models. Recent advances in Bayesian computational methods have alleviated this problem considerably. We illustrate the use of data augmentation methods for doing Bayesian inference in these applications. While the framework is formally Bayesian in nature, it can also be viewed as a computational device for calculating the likelihood function and doing likelihood-based inference. An additional advantage of data augmentation methods is that no further complications arise when failure time data are grouped or censored.","Bayesian methods,likelihood,manufacturing,posterior distributions,quality control,reliability","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,DISTRIBUTIONS,ALGORITHM","Nair, VN@Univ Michigan, Dept Stat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA@Univ Michigan, Dept Ind & Operat Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA@Univ Memphis, Dept Math Sci, Memphis, TN 38152 USA@Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Princeton, NJ 08543 USA::Tang, B@Univ Michigan, Dept Stat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA@Univ Michigan, Dept Ind & Operat Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA@Univ Memphis, Dept Math Sci, Memphis, TN 38152 USA@Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Princeton, NJ 08543 USA::Yu, LA@Univ Michigan, Dept Stat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA@Univ Michigan, Dept Ind & Operat Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA@Univ Memphis, Dept Math Sci, Memphis, TN 38152 USA@Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Princeton, NJ 08543 USA","Nair, VN@University of Michigan@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan@University of Memphis@Bristol-Myers Squibb::Tang, B@University of Michigan@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan@University of Memphis@Bristol-Myers Squibb::Yu, LA@University of Michigan@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan@University of Memphis@Bristol-Myers Squibb",not exist,"BAYESIAN COMPUTATION AND STOCHASTIC-SYSTEMS+BESAG, J; GREEN, P; HIGDON, D; et al.+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+FEB 1995::EXPLAINING THE GIBBS SAMPLER+CASELLA, G; GEORGE, EI+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 1992::no title+no author+Statistical Models in S+1992::UNDERSTANDING THE METROPOLIS-HASTINGS ALGORITHM+CHIB, S; GREENBERG, E+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+NOV 1995::THE USE AND EVALUATION OF YIELD MODELS IN INTEGRATED-CIRCUIT MANUFACTURING+CUNNINGHAM, JA+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING+MAY 1990::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::no title+Everitt, B.S; Hand, D.J.+Finite Mixture Distributions+1981::Model-free estimation of defect clustering in integrated circuit fabrication+Friedman, DJ; Hansen, MH; Nair, VN; et al.+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING+AUG 1997::STOCHASTIC RELAXATION, GIBBS DISTRIBUTIONS, AND THE BAYESIAN RESTORATION OF IMAGES+GEMAN, S; GEMAN, D+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE+1984::ZERO-INFLATED POISSON REGRESSION, WITH AN APPLICATION TO DEFECTS IN MANUFACTURING+LAMBERT, D+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1992::no title+MAJESKE KD+THESIS U MICHIGAN AN+1995::no title+Meeker, W.Q; Escobar, L.A.+Statistical Methods for Reliability Data+1998::LIMITED FAILURE POPULATION LIFE TESTS - APPLICATION TO INTEGRATED-CIRCUIT RELIABILITY+MEEKER, WQ+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1987::QUASI-BAYES SEQUENTIAL PROCEDURE FOR MIXTURES+SMITH, AFM; MAKOV, UE+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1978::A comparison of maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimators for three-parameter Weibull distribution+Smith, R.L.; Naylor, J.C.+Applied Statistics+1987::no title+Tanner, M.+Tools for statistical inference: observes data and data augmentation methods+1993::THE CALCULATION OF POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTIONS BY DATA AUGMENTATION+TANNER, MA; WING, HW+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1987::no title+TITTERINGTON D+STAT ANAL FINITE MIX+1985::no title+TITTERINGTON DM+APPLIED STATISTICS+1976::Various techniques used in connection with random digits+Von Neumann, J.+National Bureau of Standards, Applied Mathematics Series+1951"
Small sample properties of an adaptive filter applied to low volume SPC,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2001,18,13,"In many manufacturing environments. such as the nuclear weapons complex, emphasis has shifted from the regular production and delivery of large orders to infrequent small orders. However, the challenge to maintain the same high quality and reliability standards while building much smaller lot sizes remains. To meet this challenge, specific areas need more attention, including fast and on-target process start-up, low volume statistical process control, process characterization with small experiments, and estimating reliability given few actual performance tests of the product. In this paper we address the issue of low volume statistical process control. We investigate an adaptive filtering approach to process monitoring with a relatively short time series of autocorrelated data. The emphasis is on estimation and minimization of mean squared error rather than the traditional hypothesis testing and run length analyses associated with process control charting. We develop an adaptive filtering technique that assumes initial process parameters are unknown, and updates the parameters as more data become available. Using simulation techniques, we study the data requirements (the length of a time series of autocorrelated data) necessary to adequately estimate process parameters. We show that far fewer data values are needed than is typically recommended for process control applications. We also demonstrate the techniques with a case study from the nuclear weapons manufacturing complex.","adaptive filtering,autocorrelated observations",CONTROL CHARTS,"Crowder, SV@Sandia Natl Labs, Albuquerque, NM 87185 USA@Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA::Eshleman, L@Sandia Natl Labs, Albuquerque, NM 87185 USA@Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Crowder, SV@United States Department of Energy (DOE)@Sandia National Laboratory@Cornell University::Eshleman, L@United States Department of Energy (DOE)@Sandia National Laboratory@Cornell University",not exist,"no title+Astrom, K.

CUSUM control charts with variable sample sizes and sampling intervals,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2001,31,46,"Traditional control charts for process monitoring are based on taking samples of fixed size from the process using a fixed sampling interval. Variable sample size (VSS) and variable sampling interval (VSI) control charts vary the sampling rate from the process as a function of the data from the process. By sampling at a higher rate when there is an indication of a change in the process, VSS and VSI control charts can detect process changes faster than traditional control charts. Previous research has considered the properties of CUSUM charts which use the VSI feature. This paper considers CUSUM charts with the VSS feature and with both the VSS and VSI features. Two ways of developing the control statistic of these charts are considered. It is shown that using either the VSS or VSI feature in a CUSUM control chart will improve the ability to detect all but very large process shifts. The VSI feature usually gives more improvement in detection ability than the VSS feature, but using both features together will give more improvement than either one separately. Guidelines are given for choosing the possible sample sizes and the possible sampling intervals for these charts. Methods for setting up these charts for practical applications are also given.","cumulative sum control charts,variable sample sizes,variable sampling","(X)OVER-BAR CHARTS,ECONOMIC DESIGN,FIXED TIMES,SHEWHART","Arnold, JC@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Forestry, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Reynolds, MR@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Forestry, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Arnold, JC@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Reynolds, MR@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University",not exist,"AN ADAPTIVE SAMPLE-SIZE CUSUM CONTROL CHART+ANNADI, HP; KEATS, JB; RUNGER, GC; et al.+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH+JUN 1995::Control charts with variable sample size and variable interval size+Arnold, J.

Estimation of the change point of a normal process mean in SPC applications,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2001,15,83,"Knowing when a process has changed would simplify the search for and the identification of the special cause. In this paper, we compare the maximum likelihood estimator of the process change point (that is, when the process changed) to built-in change point estimators from CUSUM and EWMA control charts. We conclude that it is better to use the maximum likelihood change point estimator when a CUSUM or EWMA control chart signals a change in the process mean. We also present an approach based on the likelihood function for estimating a confidence region for the process change point. We study the performance of this estimator when it is used with the Shewhart (X) over bar control chart, the CUSUM control chart, and the EWMA control chart. The results show that the estimator provides process engineers with an accurate and useful estimate of the time of the process change.","change point estimation,CUSUM control chart,EWMA control chart,process improvement,quality control,Shewhart X control chart,special cause identification,statistical process control",AVERAGE CONTROL SCHEMES,"Pignatiello, JJ@Florida A&M Univ, Florida State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tallahassee, FL 32310 USA@SABRE Technol Solut, Southlake, TX 76092 USA::Samuel, TR@Florida A&M Univ, Florida State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tallahassee, FL 32310 USA@SABRE Technol Solut, Southlake, TX 76092 USA","Pignatiello, JJ@Florida State University@Florida A&M University@State University System of Florida@Unknow::Samuel, TR@Florida State University@Florida A&M University@State University System of Florida@Unknow",not exist,"AN ANALYSIS OF TRANSFORMATIONS+BOX, GEP; COX, DR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1964::EXACT RESULTS FOR SHEWHART CONTROL CHARTS WITH SUPPLEMENTARY RUNS RULES+CHAMP, CW; WOODALL, WH+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1987::THE RUN-LENGTH DISTRIBUTION OF A CUMULATIVE SUM CONTROL CHART+GAN, FF+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1993::INFERENCE ABOUT CHANGE-POINT FROM CUMULATIVE SUM TESTS+HINKLEY, DV+BIOMETRIKA+1971::EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE CONTROL SCHEMES - PROPERTIES AND ENHANCEMENTS+LUCAS, JM; SACCUCCI, MS+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1990::TEACHING ABOUT APPROXIMATE CONFIDENCE-REGIONS BASED ON MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION+MEEKER, WQ; ESCOBAR, LA+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+FEB 1995::A comparison of control charts from the viewpoint of change-point estimation+Nishina, K.+Quality and Reliability Engineering International+Nov.-Dec. 1992::no title+NISHINA K+REPORTS STAT APPL RE+1986::CONTINUOUS INSPECTION SCHEMES+PAGE, ES+BIOMETRIKA+1954::CUMULATIVE SUM CHARTS+PAGE, ES+TECHNOMETRICS+1961::Control chart tests based on geometric moving averages+Roberts, SW.+Technometrics+1959::AVERAGE RUN LENGTHS FOR EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE CONTROL SCHEMES USING THE MARKOV-CHAIN APPROACH+SACCUCCI, MS; LUCAS, JM+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 1990::Identifying the time of a step change with X control charts+Samuel, T.R.; Pignatiello, J.J. , Jr.; Calvin, J.A.+Quality Engineering+1998::BOUNDARY CROSSING PROBABILITIES AND STATISTICAL APPLICATIONS+SIEGMUND, D+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 1986::Comparison of CUSUM and EWMA procedures for detecting a shift in the mean or an increase in the variance+Srivastava, MS.+J Appl Stat+1994"

A synthetic control chart for detecting fraction nonconforming increases,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2001,20,67,"In this paper we propose a new control chart, the synthetic control chart, for the detection of increases in the fraction nonconforming (rho). The operation, design, and performance of this control chart are described. The synthetic chart is a combination of the np chart and the conforming run length chart. It provides the user with some freedom in adjusting the control chart parameters so that the out-of-control average time to signal can be minimized. Numerical tests have indicated that the synthetic chart has a higher power for detecting process shifts in the fraction nonconforming than both the np chart and the conforming run length chart. The improvement is significant for all cases, resulting in a 50% or greater reduction of the out-of-control average time to signal. The application of the synthetic chart may therefore substantially enhance the effectiveness of statistical process control for attributes.","average time to signal,np control charts","ECONOMIC DESIGN,P-CHARTS,ATTRIBUTE","Wu, Z@Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mech & Prod Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore::Yeo, SH@Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mech & Prod Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore::Spedding, TA@Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mech & Prod Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore","Wu, Z@Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore@Nanyang Technological University::Yeo, SH@Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore@Nanyang Technological University::Spedding, TA@Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore@Nanyang Technological University","Yeo, Song Huat@A-3810-2011","Improved p charts to monitor process quality+Acosta-Mejia, CA+IIE TRANSACTIONS+JUN 1999::DETECTING A SHIFT IN FRACTION NONCONFORMING USING RUN-LENGTH CONTROL CHARTS WITH 100-PERCENT INSPECTION+BOURKE, PD+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1991::ECONOMIC DESIGN OF ATTRIBUTE CONTROL CHARTS+CHIU, WK+TECHNOMETRICS+1975::no title+DAVIS RB+IN PRESS J QUALITY T+2001::no title+Dudewicz, E.

We also discuss multivariate statistical process control and monitoring issues.","in-line Spectroscopy,longitudinal response data,mixture-process variable design,multivariate statistical process control,split-plot designs","PROCESS VARIABLES,DESIGN","Sahni, NS@Mills DA, Res & Dev, N-0506 Oslo, Norway@Agr Univ Norway, Dept Chem Biotechnol & Food Sci, N-1432 As, Norway@Norwegian Food Res Inst, MATFORSK, N-1400 As, Norway::Aastveit, AH@Mills DA, Res & Dev, N-0506 Oslo, Norway@Agr Univ Norway, Dept Chem Biotechnol & Food Sci, N-1432 As, Norway@Norwegian Food Res Inst, MATFORSK, N-1400 As, Norway::Naes, T@Mills DA, Res & Dev, N-0506 Oslo, Norway@Agr Univ Norway, Dept Chem Biotechnol & Food Sci, N-1432 As, Norway@Norwegian Food Res Inst, MATFORSK, N-1400 As, Norway","Sahni, NS@Unknow@Norwegian University of Life Sciences@Unknow::Aastveit, AH@Unknow@Norwegian University of Life Sciences@Unknow::Naes, T@Unknow@Norwegian University of Life Sciences@Unknow",not exist,"no title+Cornell, J.A.+Experiments with mixtures: designs, models, and the analysis of mixture data+1990::ANALYZING DATA FROM MIXTURE EXPERIMENTS CONTAINING PROCESS VARIABLES - A SPLIT-PLOT APPROACH+CORNELL, JA+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 1988::no title+Diggle, PJ; Liang, K-L; Zeger, SL.+Analysis of Longitudinal Data+1996::PARTIAL LEAST-SQUARES REGRESSION - A TUTORIAL+GELADI, P; KOWALSKI, BR+ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA+JUL 31 1986::A functional data-analytic approach to signal discrimination+Hall, P; Poskitt, DS; Presnell, B+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 2001::no title+no author+The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction+2001::Multivariate strategies for classification based on NIR-spectra - with application to mayonnaise+Indahl, UG; Sahni, NS; Kirkhus, B; et al.+CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS+SEP 6 1999::no title+JACKSON JE+USERS GUIDE PRINCIPL+1991::ANALYSIS OF A 2-WAY MODEL WITH INTERACTION AND NO REPLICATION+JOHNSON, DE; GRAYBILL, FA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1972::Multivariate SPC methods for process and product monitoring+Kourti, T; MacGregor, JF+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 1996::RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN MULTIVARIATE CALIBRATION+KOWALSKI, BR; SEASHOLTZ, MB+JOURNAL OF CHEMOMETRICS+MAY 1991::no title+LORENZEN JT+DESIGN EXPT NONAME A+1993::no title+MACGREGOR JF+IFAC ADV CONTROL CHE+1994::no title+no author+Multivariate Calibration+1989::no title+Milliken, G.

A change-point model for a shift in variance,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2005,26,67,"A control chart for detecting shifts in the variance of a process is developed for the case where the nominal value of the variance is unknown. As our approach does not require that the in-control variance be known a priori, it avoids the need for a lengthy Phase I data-gathering step before charting can begin. The method is a variance-change-point model, based on the likelihood ratio test for a change in variance with the conventional Bartlett correction, adapted for repeated sequential use. The chart may be used alone in settings where one wishes to monitor one-degree-of-freedom chi-squared variates for departure from control; or it may be used together with a parallel change-point methodology for the mean to monitor process data for shifts in mean and/or variance. In both the solo use and as the scale portion of a combined scheme for monitoring changes in mean and/or variance, the approach has good performance across the range of possible shifts.","average run length,change point,control chart,CUSUM,EWMA,likelihood ratio,Phase I,Phase II,Shewhart","INDIVIDUAL OBSERVATIONS,CONTROL CHARTS,ESTIMATED PARAMETERS,SEQUENTIAL DETECTION,INTERVALS,LOCATION,TESTS","Hawkins, DM@Univ Minnesota, Sch Stat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA@Univ Iowa, Coll Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA::Zamba, KD@Univ Minnesota, Sch Stat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA@Univ Iowa, Coll Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA","Hawkins, DM@University of Minnesota Twin Cities@University of Minnesota System@University of Iowa::Zamba, KD@University of Minnesota Twin Cities@University of Minnesota System@University of Iowa",not exist,"APPROXIMATE CONFIDENCE INTERVALS .3.

Gauge R&R studies for destructive measurements,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2005,10,14,"The standard method for assessing a measurement system's precision is a gauge R&R study. Such a study involves an experiment in which each of a number of objects is measured multiple times. From the results, the spread of multiple measurements on a single object (the measurement spread) can be estimated. A serious complication is encountered when objects are affected by the measurement or when the true value of objects is variable. Such measurements are called destructive. Applying the standard gauge R&R set-up to destructive measurements is either impossible or results in an overestimation of measurement spread. This article studies alternative set-ups, which can be applied to destructive measurements if certain conditions hold. Even if required conditions are not completely met, the proposed approaches will at least lead to a smaller overestimation of measurement spread.","gauge capability,measurement system analysis,measurement theory",,"De Mast, J@Univ Amsterdam, Inst Business & Ind Stat, IBIS UvA, NL-1018 TV Amsterdam, Netherlands::Trip, A@Univ Amsterdam, Inst Business & Ind Stat, IBIS UvA, NL-1018 TV Amsterdam, Netherlands","De Mast, J@University of Amsterdam::Trip, A@University of Amsterdam","De Mast, Jeroen@A-6836-2011","no title+*AIAG+MEASUREMENT SYSTEM A+no time::no title+Allen, M.

Using genetic algorithms to generate mixture-process experimental designs involving control and noise variables,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2005,29,21,"Genetic algorithms are useful techniques for generating statistical designs when standard factorial and response surface methods either cannot be easily applied or they perform poorly. These situations often occur when the design space is highly constrained and irregular, we are using nonstandard models, or the criteria for design evaluation are complicated. We consider statistical designs for experiments involving mixture variables and process variables, some of which are noise variables that cannot be controlled under general operating conditions. For these types of experiments, it is customary to fit a response model combining mixture, process, and noise variables and to derive a model for the mean response and a model for the slope of the response. When considering experimental designs to use for these situations, low prediction variances for the mean and slope models are desirable. We evaluate some standard mixture-process variable designs with respect to these criteria and demonstrate how an experimenter can create designs with improved scaled prediction variance (SPV) properties using a genetic algorithm.","genetic algorithm,mixture-process experiments,noise variables,optimal designs,response surface methodology,robust parameter design","RESPONSE-SURFACE,ROBUST,REGRESSION,MODELS,SLOPE","Goldfarb, HB@Dial Corp, Scottsdale, AZ 85254 USA@Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA@Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA@Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA::Borror, CM@Dial Corp, Scottsdale, AZ 85254 USA@Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA@Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA@Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA::Montgomery, DC@Dial Corp, Scottsdale, AZ 85254 USA@Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA@Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA@Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA::Anderson-Cook, CM@Dial Corp, Scottsdale, AZ 85254 USA@Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA@Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA@Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA","Goldfarb, HB@Unknow@University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign@University of Illinois System@Arizona State University@United States Department of Energy (DOE)@Los Alamos National Laboratory::Borror, CM@Unknow@University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign@University of Illinois System@Arizona State University@United States Department of Energy (DOE)@Los Alamos National Laboratory::Montgomery, DC@Unknow@University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign@University of Illinois System@Arizona State University@United States Department of Energy (DOE)@Los Alamos National Laboratory::Anderson-Cook, CM@Unknow@University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign@University of Illinois System@Arizona State University@United States Department of Energy (DOE)@Los Alamos National Laboratory",not exist,"Using a genetic algorithm to generate small exact response surface designs+Borkowski, J.J.+J.

Should observations be grouped for effective process monitoring?,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2004,18,99,"When control charts are used to monitor processes to detect special causes, it is usually assumed that a special cause will produce a sustained shift in a process parameter that lasts until the shift is detected and the cause is removed. However, some special causes may produce a transient shift in a process parameter that lasts only for a short period of time. Control charts are usually based on samples of n > 1 observations using a sampling interval of fixed length, say d. When n > 1, the usual practice, based on the so-called rational subgroups concept, is to take a concentrated sample at one time point at the end of the sampling interval d, but another option is to disperse the sample over the interval d. In this paper, we investigate the question of whether it is better to use n = 1, or to use n > 1 and either concentrated or dispersed samples. The objective of monitoring is assumed to be the detection of special causes that may produce either a sustained or transient shift in the process mean mu and/or process standard deviation sigma. It is assumed that the sampling rate in terms of the number of observations per unit time is fixed, so that the ratio n/d is fixed. The best sampling strategy depends on the type of control chart being used, so Shewhart and cumulative sum (CUSUM) charts are considered. For both types of control charts, a combination of two charts is investigated; one chart is designed to monitor mu, and the other is designed to monitor sigma. The overall conclusion is that it is best to take samples of n = 1 and use a CUSUM chart combination. The Shewhart chart combination with the best overall performance is based on n > 1, but this combination has inferior statistical performance compared with the CUSUM chart combination.","average time to signal,concentrated sampling,cumulative sum control charts,dispersed sampling,exponentially weighted moving-average control charts,Shewhart control charts,statistical process control,steady state,sustained shift,transient shift,100% inspection","VARIABLE SAMPLING INTERVALS,CONTROL CHARTS,PROCESSES SUBJECT,VARIANCE,SCHEMES","Reynolds, MR@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Forestry, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA@Rutgers State Univ, Dept Management Sci & Informat Syst, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA::Stoumbos, ZG@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Forestry, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA@Rutgers State Univ, Dept Management Sci & Informat Syst, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA","Reynolds, MR@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University@Rutgers State University New Brunswick::Stoumbos, ZG@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University@Rutgers State University New Brunswick",not exist,"no title+Hawkins, D.

Multivariate control charts for monitoring autocorrelated processes,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2004,18,29,"Hotelling's T-2 chart is one of the most popular control charts for monitoring identically and independently distributed random vectors. Recently, Alwan and Alwan (1994) and Apley and Tsung (2002) studied the use of the T-2 chart for detecting mean shifts of a univariate autocorrelated process by transforming the univariate variables into multivariate vectors. This paper examines the global properties of the T-2 test when shift information is unavailable. When shift directions are known a priori, the efficiency of the T-2 test can be improved by a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) taking into consideration the special shift patterns. The proposed control chart has an intrinsic relationship with the residuals-based GLRT procedure studied in Vander Wiel (1996) and Apley and Shi (1999). Retaining the T-2 chart's advantages of a wide range sensitivity for mean shift detection, the proposed control chart is shown to outperform the T-2 chart and the residual-based GLRT procedure when monitoring the mean of a univariate autocorrelated process. Performance enhancement and deterioration in the face of gradual shifts are also discussed.","generalized likelihood ratio test,Hotelling's T-2 chart,regression-adjusted chart","STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,RUN-LENGTH,CUSUM PROCEDURES,VARIABLES,T-2","Jiang, W@Stevens Inst Technol, Dept Syst Engn & Engn Management, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA","Jiang, W@Stevens Institute of Technology",not exist,"Monitoring autocorrelated processes using multivariate quality control charts+Alwan, AJ; Alwan, LC.+P DEC SCI I ANN M+1994::TIME-SERIES MODELING FOR STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL+ALWAN, LC; ROBERTS, HV+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JAN 1988::no title+Anderson, T.+An Introdiction to Multivariate Statistical Analysis+1984::The GLRT for statistical process control of autocorrelated processes+Apley, DW; Shi, J+IIE TRANSACTIONS+SEP 1999::The autoregressive T-2 chart for monitoring univariate autocorrelated processes+Apley, DW; Tsung, F+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2002::APPROACH TO PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION OF CUSUM RUN LENGTH+BROOK, D; EVANS, DA+BIOMETRIKA+1972::MULTIVARIATE QUALITY-CONTROL BASED ON REGRESSION-ADJUSTED VARIABLES+HAWKINS, DM+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1991::A NOTE ON MULTIVARIATE CUSUM PROCEDURES+HEALY, JD+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1987::Average run length computation of ARMA charts for stationary processes+Jiang, W+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+2001::Proportional integral derivative charts for process monitoring+Jiang, W; Wu, HQ; Tsung, FG; et al.+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 2002::no title+KRIEGER CA+MODELING SIMULATIO 1+1992::no title+Lehmann, E.L.+Testing Statistical Hypotheses+1991::EWMA control charts for monitoring the mean of autocorrelated processes+Lu, CW; Reynolds, MR+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 1999::DECOMPOSITION OF T-2 FOR MULTIVARIATE CONTROL CHART INTERPRETATION+MASON, RL; TRACY, ND; YOUNG, JC+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 1995::SOME STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL METHODS FOR AUTOCORRELATED DATA+MONTGOMERY, DC; MASTRANGELO, CM+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1991::AVERAGE RUN LENGTHS FOR CUSUM CONTROL CHARTS APPLIED TO RESIDUALS+RUNGER, GC; WILLEMAIN, TR; PRABHU, S+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1995::Monitoring processes that wander using integrated moving average models+VanderWiel, SA+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 1996::THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE RUN LENGTH OF ONE-SIDED CUSUM PROCEDURES FOR CONTINUOUS RANDOM-VARIABLES+WOODALL, WH+TECHNOMETRICS+1983"
Multifactor B-spline mixed models in designed experiments for the engine mapping problem,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2004,20,15,"In practical applications, a response surface may have a shape that is too complicated to be adequately described by a low-order polynomial over the region where predictions are required. The use of polynomial spline regression models in which the effects of one or more factors are modeled using B-spline basis functions allows greater model flexibility and can lead to more accurate predictions than traditional polynomial models. Multifactor B-spline regression models are described that have useful properties for designing experiments, including the advantage that linear model theory applies, An application of the models is discussed in a case study from the automotive industry on modeling torque in engine mapping using a two-stage hierarchical model, A B-spline model with known knots is used at the second stage to represent each of the response features of engineering interest that are carried forward from the first-stage modeling. The model is fitted over a constrained design region using data obtained from an experiment that employs a V-optimal design generated by a standard search algorithm using a tailored candidate list. Validation runs are used to assess the accuracy of predictions and to show that the approach is effective.","B-spline,engine mapping,factorial experiment,model validation,optimal design,response feature,two-stage model","VARYING-COEFFICIENT MODELS,REGRESSION","Grove, DM@Univ Southampton, Southampton Stat Sci Res Inst, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England::Woods, DC@Univ Southampton, Southampton Stat Sci Res Inst, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England::Lewis, SM@Univ Southampton, Southampton Stat Sci Res Inst, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England","Grove, DM@University of Southampton::Woods, DC@University of Southampton::Lewis, SM@University of Southampton",not exist,"no title+Atkinson, A.C.; Donev, A.N.+Optimum Experimental Designs+1992::no title+Bates, D.

A Stepwise selection procedure is known to be ineffective because it tends to select too many inactive factors and miss some active factors. Several methods have been proposed in the literature in recent years, which are effective in some aspects. In this article, we introduce a new strategy of searching active factors in supersaturated screening experiments based on the idea of staged dimensionality reduction. Simulation and real data studies demonstrate that this strategy is quite effective.

Efficient two-level designs for estimating all main effects and two-factor interactions,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2004,28,19,"Regular 2(V)(k - p) designs for a large number of factors require many more treatment combinations than there are lower order effects to be estimated. For example, 2(9 - 2) = 128 treatment combinations are required to estimate only nine main effects and their 36 two-factor interactions. Nonregular orthogonal designs as well as nonorthogonal designs provide attractive alternatives in such cases. This article reviews the literature regarding alternatives to the usual orthogonal resolution V designs and suggests questions for future research. The topic is illustrated with a ballistic missile simulation application requiring estimation of main effects and two-factor interactions for 47 factors. For such large examples, run-size efficiency is more important than variance efficiency.","fractional factorial,nonregular fraction,orthogonal array,resolution V,three-quarter fraction","FRACTIONAL FACTORIAL-DESIGNS,512-RUN DESIGNS,RESOLUTION-V,2N DESIGNS,CONSTRUCTION,SEQUENCES,PLANS,SET","Mee, RW@Univ Tennessee, Dept Stat Operat & Management Sci, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA","Mee, RW@University of Tennessee Knoxville@University of Tennessee System",not exist,"SEQUENCES OF 2-LEVEL FRACTIONAL FACTORIAL PLANS+ADDELMAN, S+TECHNOMETRICS+1969::IRREGULAR FRACTIONS OF 2N FACTORIAL EXPERIMENTS+ADDELMAN, S+TECHNOMETRICS+1961::no title+BLOCK RM+THESIS U TENNESSEE K+2003::A CATALOG OF 2-LEVEL AND 3-LEVEL FRACTIONAL FACTORIAL-DESIGNS WITH SMALL RUNS+CHEN, JH; SUN, DX; WU, CFJ+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+APR 1993::SEQUENCES OF FRACTIONAL REPLICATES IN 2P-Q SERIES+DANIEL, C+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1962::Fractional replication in industrial research+Daniel, C.+P 3 BERK S MATH STAT+1956::no title+DIAMOND WJ+PRACTICAL EXPT DESIG+1989::CONSTRUCTION OF A SET OF 512-RUN DESIGNS OF RESOLUTION GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 5 AND A SET OF EVEN 1024-RUN DESIGNS OF RESOLUTION GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 6+DRAPER, NR; MITCHELL, TJ+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1970::CONSTRUCTION OF SET OF 256-RUN DESIGNS OF RESOLUTION ]=5 AND SET OF EVEN 512-RUN DESIGNS OF RESOLUTION ]=6 WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO UNIQUE SATURATED DESIGNS+DRAPER, NR; MITCHELL, TJ+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1968::CAPACITY CONSIDERATIONS FOR 2-LEVEL FRACTIONAL FACTORIAL-DESIGNS+DRAPER, NR; LIN, DKJ+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+JAN 1990::Fixing a factor in the sequential design of two-level fractional factorial experiments+Gilmour, SG; Mead, R+JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS+FEB 1996::THE Z4-LINEARITY OF KERDOCK, PREPARATA, GOETHALS, AND RELATED CODES+HAMMONS, AR; KUMAR, PV; CALDERBANK, AR; et al.+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY+MAR 1994::no title+Hedayat, A.

"Mixture component-amount designs via projections, including orthogonally blocked designs",JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2004,16,7,"Traditional mixture experiments are designed to investigate the effects of changing the relative proportions of mixture ingredients using the same total amount, usually coded to 1, or to 100%. In some studies however, such as those on fertilizers, the total amount used also affects the response and needs to be investigated as well. For such component-amount experiments, several levels of total amount are needed. Two ways of obtaining suitable designs are given here. Both ways use the idea of projecting known mixture designs into fewer dimensions.

First, standard designs of the simplex-lattice and simplex-centroid types are projected to obtain sets of points at various levels of total amount for two or more ingredients. The sets occur with varying multiplicities, which can be varied to produce D-optimal choices, if desired. Second, orthogonally blocked (for standard second order mixtures models) designs that have previously been constructed by combining Latin squares are projected down into lower dimensions. These projected designs are also orthogonal to specific component-amount models suggested in the literature for fitting data from component-amount designs, with proper choice of blocking variables. Moreover, the specific designs of this type that are D-optimal in four dimensions for a second-order Scheffe model remain D-optimal for the corresponding second-order component-amount model after projection into three dimensions.

A previously published bread-making experiment that employed an orthogonally blocked design for four mixture ingredients provides data that are re-analyzed. We show a component-amount equation that performs well can be fitted in only two components, while the orthogonal blocking feature for the original design and mixture model is preserved for the projected design and the mixture-amount model.",,"PROCESS VARIABLES,MODELS","Prescott, P@Univ Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England@Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA::Draper, NR@Univ Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England@Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Prescott, P@University of Southampton@University of Wisconsin System@University of Wisconsin Madison::Draper, NR@University of Southampton@University of Wisconsin System@University of Wisconsin Madison",not exist,"Optimal designs for experiments with mixtures: A survey+Chan, LY+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2000::Optimal orthogonal block designs for a quadratic mixture model for three components+Chan, LY; Sandhu, MK+JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS+JAN 1999::no title+Cornell, J.

A genetic algorithm approach to multiple-response optimization,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2004,24,52,"Many designed experiments require the simultaneous optimization of multiple responses. A common approach is to use a desirability function combined with an optimization algorithm to find the most desirable settings of the controllable factors. However, as the problem grows even moderately in either the number of factors or the number of responses, conventional optimization algorithms can fail to find the global optimum. An alternative approach is to use a heuristic search procedure such as a genetic algorithm (GA). This paper proposes and develops a multiple-response solution technique using a GA in conjunction with an unconstrained desirability function. The GA requires that several parameters be determined in order for the algorithm to operate effectively. We perform a robust designed experiment in order to tune the genetic algorithm to perform well regardless of the complexity of the multiple-response optimization problem. The performance of the proposed GA method is evaluated and compared with the performance of the method that combines the desirability with the generalized reduced gradient (GRG) optimization. The evaluation shows that only the proposed GA approach consistently and effectively solves multiple-response problems of varying complexity.","heuristic methods,regression modeling,response surface desirability functions",,"Ortiz, F@Florida A&M Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tallahassee, FL 32310 USA@Florida State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tallahassee, FL 32310 USA@Pacific NW Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99352 USA::Simpson, JR@Florida A&M Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tallahassee, FL 32310 USA@Florida State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tallahassee, FL 32310 USA@Pacific NW Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99352 USA::Pignatiello, JJ@Florida A&M Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tallahassee, FL 32310 USA@Florida State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tallahassee, FL 32310 USA@Pacific NW Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99352 USA::Heredia-Langner, A@Florida A&M Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tallahassee, FL 32310 USA@Florida State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tallahassee, FL 32310 USA@Pacific NW Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99352 USA","Ortiz, F@State University System of Florida@Florida A&M University@State University System of Florida@Florida State University@Pacific Northwest National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)::Simpson, JR@State University System of Florida@Florida A&M University@State University System of Florida@Florida State University@Pacific Northwest National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)::Pignatiello, JJ@State University System of Florida@Florida A&M University@State University System of Florida@Florida State University@Pacific Northwest National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)::Heredia-Langner, A@State University System of Florida@Florida A&M University@State University System of Florida@Florida State University@Pacific Northwest National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)",not exist,"no title+Back, Thomas.+Evolutionary algorithms in theory and practice-evolution strategies, evolutionary programming, genetic algorithms+1996::Using a genetic algorithm to generate small exact response surface designs+Borkowski, J.J.+J.

Evaluating mixture-process designs with control and noise variables,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2004,30,8,"Mixture-process experiments involve two distinct types of variables. The mixture variables are varied through their relative proportions and cannot be adjusted independently. The process variables can be varied independently of one another and of the mixture components. When some of the process variables are noise variables, variables that cannot be controlled in normal process operation, we are in a robust design setting. In these situations, it is customary to fit a response model combining mixture, process, and noise variables and to derive a model for the mean response and a model for the variance of the response for this response model. The variance model is directly related to the directional derivative (slope) of the response surface in the directions of the noise variables. We develop expressions for the scaled and unscaled prediction variances of both the mean and slope models.

Run-length performance of regression control charts with estimated parameters,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2004,22,26,"The regression control chart is an effective statistical process control (SPC) tool in situations where the output characteristic of interest is affected by an external covariate. It has many applications, including monitoring and diagnosing multistage processes. Its basic purpose is to remove the influence of the covariate using regression adjustment and then apply a regular control scheme to the regression residual. In practice, the regression model relating the output and the covariate is rarely known and needs to be estimated. Little is known about the performance of the regression control chart when the true parameters are replaced with their estimates. In this paper, the run length performance of regression control charts with estimated parameters is studied. Two types of regression control charts are considered: a Shewhart control for regression residuals, and an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control for regression residuals.","exponentially weighted moving average,statistical process control","MULTIVARIATE QUALITY-CONTROL,(X)OVER-BAR CHARTS,VARIANCE,VARIABLES,LIMITS","Shu, LJ@Univ Macau, Taipa, Macao@Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China@Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA::Tsung, F@Univ Macau, Taipa, Macao@Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China@Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA::Tsui, KL@Univ Macau, Taipa, Macao@Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China@Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Shu, LJ@University of Macau@Hong Kong University of Science & Technology@Georgia Institute of Technology@University System of Georgia::Tsung, F@University of Macau@Hong Kong University of Science & Technology@Georgia Institute of Technology@University System of Georgia::Tsui, KL@University of Macau@Hong Kong University of Science & Technology@Georgia Institute of Technology@University System of Georgia","Shu, Lianjie@B-7911-2016::TSUI, Kwok Leung@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0558-2279","no title+APLEY DW+IN PRESS TECHNOMETRI+2003::INFLUENCE OF REFERENCE VALUES AND ESTIMATED VARIANCE ON ARL OF CUSUM TESTS+BAGSHAW, M; JOHNSON, RA+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1975::A method for deriving integral equations useful in control chart performance analysis+Champ, CW; Rigdon, SE; Scharnagl, KA+NONLINEAR ANALYSIS-THEORY METHODS &amp; APPLICATIONS+AUG 2001::The mean and standard deviation of the run length distribution of (X)over-bar charts when control limits are estimated+Chen, GM+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 1997::AVERAGE RUN LENGTHS OF EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE CONTROL CHARTS+CROWDER, SV+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1987::Evaluation of run length distribution for (X)over-bar charts with unknown variance+DelCastillo, E+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 1996::SHEWHART XBAR-CHARTS WITH ESTIMATED PROCESS VARIANCE+GHOSH, BK; REYNOLDS, MR; VANHUI, Y+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS PART A-THEORY AND METHODS+1981::REGRESSION ADJUSTMENT FOR VARIABLES IN MULTIVARIATE QUALITY-CONTROL+HAWKINS, DM+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1993::SELF-STARTING CUSUM CHARTS FOR LOCATION AND SCALE+HAWKINS, DM+STATISTICIAN+1987::MULTIVARIATE QUALITY-CONTROL BASED ON REGRESSION-ADJUSTED VARIABLES+HAWKINS, DM+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1991::The performance of exponentially weighted moving average charts with estimated parameters+Jones, LA; Champ, CW; Rigdon, SE+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 2001::EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE CONTROL SCHEMES - PROPERTIES AND ENHANCEMENTS+LUCAS, JM; SACCUCCI, MS+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1990::no title+MANDEL BJ+J QUAL TECHNOL+1969::no title+Montgomery, D.

Shewhart charts for monitoring the variance components,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2004,16,11,"The monitoring of process variance is important in ensuring consistent quality. It is more effective and appropriate to monitor the decomposed variance components rather than the overall variance, if the associated special causes of respective variance components can be identified. In the literature, the Shewhart chart with approximate control limits has been proposed for monitoring the variance components, but we show this method is insensitive to detecting increases in the process variance. In this paper, the probability distribution of the sample statistic of variance component is derived as an exact formula, from which the exact Shewhart limits are obtained. Simple procedures for designing Shewhart charts for monitoring variance components are provided. The application of the Shewhart charts is demonstrated with real manufacturing data.","average run length,Chi-squared distribution,quality control,random effects,statistical process control",,"Chang, TC@Univ Macau, Macao, Peoples R China@Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore 117543, Singapore::Gan, FF@Univ Macau, Macao, Peoples R China@Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore 117543, Singapore","Chang, TC@University of Macau@National University of Singapore::Gan, FF@University of Macau@National University of Singapore",not exist,"A CUMULATIVE SUM CONTROL CHART FOR MONITORING PROCESS VARIANCE+CHANG, TC; GAN, FF+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 1995::AN EWMA FOR MONITORING A PROCESS STANDARD-DEVIATION+CROWDER, SV; HAMILTON, MD+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 1992::no title+Duncan, A.

Using control charts to monitor process and product quality profiles,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2004,62,249,"In most statistical process control (SPC) applications, it is assumed that the quality of a process or product can be adequately represented by the distribution of a univariate quality characteristic or by the general multivariate distribution of a vector consisting of several correlated quality characteristics. In many practical situations, however, the quality of a process or product is better characterized and summarized by a relationship between a response variable and one or more explanatory variables. Thus, at each sampling stage, one observes a collection of data points that can be represented by a curve (or profile). In some calibration applications, the profile can be represented adequately by a simple straight-line model, while in other applications, more complicated models are needed. In this expository paper, we discuss some of the general issues involved in using control charts to monitor such process- and product-quality profiles and review the SPC literature on the topic. We relate this application to functional data analysis and review applications involving linear profiles, nonlinear profiles, and the use of splines and wavelets. We strongly encourage research in profile monitoring and provide some research ideas.","calibration,linear regression,multivariate quality control,nonlinear regression,splines,statistical process control,wavelets","STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,MULTIVARIATE CONTROL CHARTS,REGRESSION-ADJUSTED VARIABLES,MULTIPLE STREAM PROCESSES,LINEAR-REGRESSION,PERFORMANCE,CURVES,COMPONENTS,DESIGN,TIME","Woodall, WH@Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA@Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA::Spitzner, DJ@Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA@Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA::Montgomery, DC@Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA@Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA::Gupta, S@Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA@Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Woodall, WH@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University@Arizona State University::Spitzner, DJ@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University@Arizona State University::Montgomery, DC@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University@Arizona State University::Gupta, S@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University@Arizona State University","Woodall, William@A-8094-2009","no title+AJMANI VB+JOINT STAT M SAN FRA+2003::Optimal changepoint tests for normal linear regression+Andrews, DWK; Lee, I; Ploberger, W+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JAN 1996::Accuracy (trueness and precision) of Measurement Methods and Results-Use in Pratice of Accuracy Values+[Anonymous].+International Standards Organization-ISO 5725-6+1994::no title+*ANSI ASQC+B1 1996 GUID QUAL CO+1996::Process-oriented basis representations for multivariate process diagnostics+Barton, R.R.; Gonzalez-Barreto, D.R.+Quality Engineering+1996-1997::Multivariate image analysis for real-time process monitoring and control+Bharati, MH; MacGregor, JF+INDUSTRIAL &amp; ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH+DEC 1998::Materiel division, procurement quality assurance department, advanced quality system tools+no author+AQS D1-9000-1.+1998::no title+BOX GEP+EVOLUTIONARY OPERATI+1969::A Case Study for Control Charting a Product Quality Measure That is a Continuous Function Over Time+Brill, R.

Comparing the capability of two processes using C-pm,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2004,20,23,"The indices C-p and C-pk are extensively used to assess process capability. However, they only take into account the process mean and standard deviation, but not the proximity of the process mean to the target value, T of the process characteristic. C-pm does take into account the proximity of the process mean to the target value. We propose a method for selecting or judging the better of two suppliers or processes based on a confidence interval for the ratio C-pm1/C-pm2. Four methods of obtaining approximate confidence intervals are presented and compared, one based on the statistical theory given in Boyles (1991) and three based on the bootstrap, (referred to as SB (standard bootstrap), PB (percentile bootstrap), and BCPB (biased-corrected percentile bootstrap)). The performance was compared using simulation, which showed that, in two independent and normal process environments, Boyles's (1991) confidence interval and the SB confidence interval are more reliable than the PB and BCPB methods. A sample size of greater than 50 is recommended for selecting the most capable of two suppliers or processes.","bootstrap simulation method,confidence interval,coverage percentage,process capability indices","LOWER CONFIDENCE-LIMITS,BOOTSTRAP,INDEXES,JACKKNIFE","Chen, JP@Natl Chin Yi Inst Technol Taipin, Inst Prod Syst Engn & Managment, Taichung, Taiwan::Chen, KS@Natl Chin Yi Inst Technol Taipin, Inst Prod Syst Engn & Managment, Taichung, Taiwan","Chen, JP@Unknow::Chen, KS@Unknow","Chen, Kuen-Suan@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1091-6392","no title+AGUCHI G+1985 ASA ANN M LAS V+1985::How reliable is your capability index?+Bissell, A.F.+Appl.

A posterior predictive approach to multiple response surface optimization,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2004,31,71,"In this paper we present an approach to multiple response surface optimization that not only provides optimal operating conditions, but also measures the reliability of an acceptable quality result for any set of operating conditions. The most utilized multiple response optimization approaches of ""overlapping mean responses'' or the desirability function do not take into account the variance-covariance structure of the data nor the model parameter uncertainty. Some of the quadratic loss function approaches take into account the variance-covariance structure of the predicted means, but they do not take into account the model parameter uncertainty associated with the variance-covariance matrix of the error terms. For the optimal conditions obtained by these approaches, the probability that they provide a good multivariate response, as measured by that optimization criterion, can be unacceptably low. Furthermore, it is shown that ignoring the model parameter uncertainty can lead to reliability estimates that are too large. The proposed approach can be used with most of the current multiresponse optimization procedures to assess the reliability of a good future response. This approach takes into account the correlation structure of the data, the variability of the process distribution, and the model parameter uncertainty. The utility of this method is illustrated with two examples.","Bayesian analysis,desirability function,mixture experiments,preposterior analysis,proportion conforming,quadratic loss function,reliability,ridge analysis,simulation","RIDGE ANALYSIS,SIMULATION,DESIGN","Peterson, JJ@GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceut, Dept Stat Sci, King Of Prussia, PA 19406 USA","Peterson, JJ@GlaxoSmithKline",not exist,"Quality loss functions for optimization across multiple response surfaces+Ames, AE; Mattucci, N; MacDonald, S; et al.+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1997::no title+ANDERSON MJ+CHEM ENG PROGR   APR+1998::Bayesian design of ""successful"" replications+Bayarri, MJ; Mayoral, AM+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 2002::Genetic algorithms and their statistical applications: An introduction+Chatterjee, S; Laudato, M; Lynch, LA+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+OCT 23 1996::Analyzing experiments with correlated multiple responses+Chiao, CH; Hamada, M+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 2001::Modified desirability functions for multiple response optimization+DelCastillo, E; Montgomery, DC; McCarville, DR+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1996::Multiresponse process optimization via constrained confidence regions+DelCastillo, E+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 1996::SIMULTANEOUS-OPTIMIZATION OF SEVERAL RESPONSE VARIABLES+DERRINGER, G; SUICH, R+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+1980::no title+DERRINGER GC+QUALITY PROGR    JUN+1994::INFLUENCE OF NONIONIC SURFACTANTS ON THE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL-PROPERTIES OF A BIODEGRADABLE PSEUDOLATEX+FRISBEE, SE; MCGINITY, JW+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICS AND BIOPHARMACEUTICS+DEC 1994::The desirability function+Harrington, E.C.+Industrial Quality Control+1965::RIDGE ANALYSIS 25 YEARS LATER+HOERL, RW+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+1985::no title+Hosmer, DW; Lemeshow, S.+Applied logistic regression+2002::no title+Johnson, M.

Two approaches for improving the dual response method in robust parameter design,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2004,23,22,"The prediction properties of models used in the dual response approach to robust parameter design are studied, and two procedures that improve the performance of the approach are proposed. The first procedure suggests scaling of the noise variables to reduce the expected mean squared error of the variance model, based on the concept that the range of the noise variables used in the experimental design should contain most of their distribution. Naturally, the scaling improves the fit of the part of the model associated with the noise factors. However, it is shown that such scaling does not alter the variance contribution of the noise factors, which is fundamental for robust parameter design. The second procedure combines the variance due to the noise factors with the variance due to the prediction error of the fitted model (i.e., it looks at the variance of the predictions), thus considering all sources of variability present in the problem. An unbiased estimator of this combined variance is developed. Two examples are given for each procedure. The second proposed approach is compared with the dual response approach recommended in the literature by means of the prediction intervals of the responses, as recently discussed by Myers et al. (1997). It is found in the examples that the new procedure gives narrower intervals (50%, and 12% percent smaller) where the degree of improvement depends, as expected, on the goodness of fit of the response surface model. The resulting solutions thus obtained are robust to both noise factor and parameter estimation uncertainty. Negative variance values, possible in the usual dual response approach in the literature, are avoided in the new formulation.","noise factors,process optimization,response surface methodology","SURFACE METHODOLOGY,MIXED RESOLUTION,NOISE VARIABLES,TAGUCHI,ALTERNATIVES","Miro-Quesada, G@Eli Lilly & Co, Eli Lilly Bioproc Res & Dev, Lilly Tech Ctr N, Indianapolis, IN 46221 USA@Penn State Univ, Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA::Del Castillo, E@Eli Lilly & Co, Eli Lilly Bioproc Res & Dev, Lilly Tech Ctr N, Indianapolis, IN 46221 USA@Penn State Univ, Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Miro-Quesada, G@Eli Lilly@Penn State University@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)::Del Castillo, E@Eli Lilly@Penn State University@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)",not exist,"no title+Arnold, S.

Analysis considerations in industrial split-plot experiments with non-normal responses,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2004,20,12,"Non-normal responses are common in many industrial experiments. When there are factors whose levels are difficult and/or costly to control, an experiment is typically run within a split-plot context. Industrial split-plot experiments have received a great deal of attention in the literature in the normal response, linear model setting. Generalized linear models have been proposed for the analysis of completely randomized designs when the response is non-normal. When one uses a completely randomized design, there is an implication that responses are independent. For split-plot experimentation there is an assumption that responses within a given whole plot are correlated. To account for this correlation, generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) can be used for analysis. Generalized linear mixed models fall into two categories: population-averaged models and batch-specific models. We give an expository treatment of GLMM and discuss the differences in interpretations of the population-averaged and batch-specific models using an example from film manufacturing.","generalized linear mixed models,mixture experiments,split-plot design","GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,MIXED MODELS","Robinson, TJ@Univ Wyoming, Dept Stat, Laramie, WY 82071 USA@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA@Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA::Myers, RH@Univ Wyoming, Dept Stat, Laramie, WY 82071 USA@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA@Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA::Montgomery, DC@Univ Wyoming, Dept Stat, Laramie, WY 82071 USA@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA@Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Robinson, TJ@University of Wyoming@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University@Arizona State University::Myers, RH@University of Wyoming@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University@Arizona State University::Montgomery, DC@University of Wyoming@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University@Arizona State University",not exist,"Design issues in fractional factorial split-plot experiments+Bingham, DR; Sitter, RR+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2001::APPROXIMATE INFERENCE IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS+BRESLOW, NE; CLAYTON, DG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::no title+Brown, H.+Applied mixed models in medicine: statistics in practice+2001::ANALYZING DATA FROM MIXTURE EXPERIMENTS CONTAINING PROCESS VARIABLES - A SPLIT-PLOT APPROACH+CORNELL, JA+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 1988::The use of mixed logit models to reflect heterogeneity in capture-recapture studies+Coull, BA; Agresti, A+BIOMETRICS+MAR 1999::no title+DIGGLE PJ+ANAL LONGITUDINAL DA+1995::Generalized linear models for quality-improvement experiments+Hamada, M; Nelder, JA+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1997::Hierarchical generalized linear models+Lee, Y; Nelder, JA+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1996::Response surface methods for bi-randomization structures+Letsinger, JD; Myers, RH; Lentner, M+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 1996::Examples of designed experiments with nonnormal responses+Lewis, SL; Montgomery, DC; Myers, RH+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 2001::LONGITUDINAL DATA-ANALYSIS USING GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS+LIANG, KY; ZEGER, SL+BIOMETRIKA+APR 1986::On the appropriateness of marginal models for repeated measurements in clinical trials+Lindsey, JK; Lambert, P+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+FEB 28 1998::A covariance estimator for GEE with improved small-sample properties+Mancl, LA; DeRouen, TA+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2001::no title+McCulloch, P.; Nelder, J.A.+Generalized linear models+1989::Analysis of count data from before-after control-impact studies+McDonald, TL; Erickson, WP; McDonald, LL+JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS+SEP 2000::no title+Myers, R.

The effect of pooled and un-pooled variance estimators on C-pm when using subsamples,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2004,18,7,"The vast majority of research on capability indices has assumed that the data consists of one large, representative sample. In practice, and in much of the quality control literature, process data are collected over time in subsamples representing rational subgroups. In this paper we examine the statistical behavior of two C-pm estimators based on this more realistic data structure. The estimators correspond to pooled and un-pooled variance estimators. The theoretical findings are applied to hypothesis testing and power calculations. The power functions of the tests based on the two estimators are used to determine the minimum number of subsamples needed to meet a threshold requirement that power exceeds 0.80. Extensive tables of the recommended number of subsamples are provided with comments on their usage.","capability indices,hypothesis testing,power,sample size","PROCESS CAPABILITY INDEXES,SIGMA","Hubele, NF@Arizona State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA@Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Math, SE-97187 Lulea, Sweden::Vannman, K@Arizona State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA@Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Math, SE-97187 Lulea, Sweden","Hubele, NF@Arizona State University@Lulea University of Technology::Vannman, K@Arizona State University@Lulea University of Technology",not exist,"Variable sampling plans for normal distribution indexed by Taguchi's loss function+Arizono, I; Kanagawa, A; Ohta, H; et al.+NAVAL RESEARCH LOGISTICS+SEP 1997::THE TAGUCHI CAPABILITY INDEX+BOYLES, RA+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 1991::A NEW MEASURE OF PROCESS CAPABILITY - CPM+CHAN, LK; CHENG, SW; SPIRING, FA+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1988::Is the process capable?

Estimating sensitivity of process capability modeled by a transfer function,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2004,28,4,"We assume that the output variable Y of a process with a number of inputs(X-1, X-2,..., X-n) is subject to specification limits, and that the inputs can be represented as random variables. The probability that Y falls within its specification limits is a measure of process capability. In this paper, we demonstrate a one-pass Monte Carlo simulation method that allows the estimation of the sensitivity of process capability to each parameter of the input variables. The proposed method may have gains in efficiency, in terms of reduction in root mean squared error, of several hundred times over competing methods. The results can be used to improve system performance by directing attention to those parameters for which small changes result in the largest change in capability. In this paper we outline the algorithm, demonstrate it on three problems, and provide some discussion of why it works.","Monte Carlo simulation,six sigma,stochastic derivatives","PARAMETER DESIGN,TAGUCHI METHOD,LINE","Bowman, A@Union Coll, Grad Coll, Schenectady, NY 12308 USA::Schmee, J@Union Coll, Grad Coll, Schenectady, NY 12308 USA","Bowman, A@Union College::Schmee, J@Union College",not exist,"Tolerancing mechanical assemblies with CAD and DOE+Bisgaard, S; Graves, S; Shin, G+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 2000::Designing experiments for tolerancing assembled products+Bisgaard, S+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 1997::no title+BRADY DD+ELECT DESIGN+1978::no title+Breyfogle, F.

Factorial experiments when factor levels are not necessarily reset,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2004,18,24,"In industry, the run order of experiments is often randomized, but this does not guarantee that all factor levels are reset from one run to the next. When this happens and the levels of factors are the same in successive runs, the assumption of independent observations from run to run may be violated or incorrect. In this case, an ordinary least squares analysis can produce biased estimates of the coefficients in the model, which leads to erroneous test results and inferences. In this paper we describe how not resetting the levels of one or more factors in successive runs can result in less precision in parameter estimates and a larger than expected prediction variance. We present formulas for the prediction variance and the expected prediction variance for this situation. These quantities are important because they allow us to compare the prediction properties of experiments that are completely randomized to experiments where the levels of one or more factors are not reset. We give an analysis of an industrial experiment of this type and recommendations for carrying out factorial experiments where the levels of one or more factors are not reset.","design of experiments,prediction variance,randomization,split-plot designs","RANDOMIZATION,RESTRICTIONS","Webb, DF@Bemidji State Univ, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Bemidji, MN 56601 USA@JM Lucas & Associates, Wilmington, DE 19808 USA@Montana State Univ, Dept Math Sci, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA::Lucas, JM@Bemidji State Univ, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Bemidji, MN 56601 USA@JM Lucas & Associates, Wilmington, DE 19808 USA@Montana State Univ, Dept Math Sci, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA::Borkowski, JJ@Bemidji State Univ, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Bemidji, MN 56601 USA@JM Lucas & Associates, Wilmington, DE 19808 USA@Montana State Univ, Dept Math Sci, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA","Webb, DF@Bemidji State University@Unknow@Montana State University Bozeman@Montana State University System@Montana State University::Lucas, JM@Bemidji State University@Unknow@Montana State University Bozeman@Montana State University System@Montana State University::Borkowski, JJ@Bemidji State University@Unknow@Montana State University Bozeman@Montana State University System@Montana State University",not exist,"no title+ANBARI FT+THESIS DREXEL U+1993::no title+Atkinson, A.C.; Donev, A.N.+Optimum Experimental Designs+1992::no title+BINGHAM DR+J QUAL TECHNOL+2001::Analysis of unbalanced data from an experiment with random block effects and unequally spaced factor levels+Ganju, J; Lucas, JM+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+FEB 2000::Bias in test statistics when restrictions in randomization are caused by factors+Ganju, J; Lucas, JM+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1997::Detecting randomization restrictions caused by factors+Ganju, J; Lucas, JM+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+OCT 1 1999::Optimal split-plot designs+Goos, P; Vandebroek, M+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 2001::L-k factorial experiments with hard-to-change and easy-to-change factors+Ju, HL; Lucas, JM+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 2002::no title+KIEFER J+ANN MATH STAT+1974::The equivalence of two extremum problems+Kiefer, J.; Wolfowitz, J.+Canad.

Outperforming completely randomized designs,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2004,21,48,"Split-plot designs have become increasingly popular in industrial experimentation because some of the factors under investigation are often hard-to-change. It is well-known that the resulting compound symmetric error structure not only affects estimation and inference procedures but also the efficiency of the experimental designs used. In this paper, we compute D-optimal first and second order split-plot designs and show that these designs, in many cases, outperform completely randomized designs in terms of D- and G-efficiency. This suggests that split-plot designs should be considered as an alternative to completely randomized designs even if running a completely randomized design is affordable.","design of experiments,D-optimality,G-optimality,split-plot designs","RESPONSE-SURFACE DESIGNS,SPLIT-PLOT DESIGNS,RESTRICTIONS,CONSTRUCTION,FACTORIAL,BLOCKING","Goos, P@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Appl Econ, Fund Sci Res Flanders, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium::Vandebroek, M@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Appl Econ, Fund Sci Res Flanders, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium","Goos, P@KU Leuven::Vandebroek, M@KU Leuven","Vandebroek, Martina@J-9103-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0317-1986","SUPER-EFFICIENT DESIGNS - HOW TO RUN YOUR EXPERIMENT FOR HIGHER EFFICIENCY AND LOWER COST+ANBARI, FT; LUCAS, JM+ASQC 48TH ANNUAL QUALITY CONGRESS PROCEEDINGS+1994::THE CONSTRUCTION OF EXACT D-OPTIMUM EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGNS WITH APPLICATION TO BLOCKING RESPONSE-SURFACE DESIGNS+ATKINSON, AC; DONEV, AN+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1989::no title+ATKINSON AC+OPTIMUM EXPT DESIGNS+1999::The design and analysis of 2(k-p)xs prototype experiments+Bisgaard, S; Steinberg, DM+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1997::Split-plot designs for robust product experimentation+Box, G.

Multiresponse robust design: A general framework based on combined array,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2004,27,32,"Although multiple responses are quite common in practical applications, the robust design problem is frequently dealt with by considering only one response. In this paper we present a general framework for the multivariate problem when data are collected from a combined array. Within the framework, both parameter and tolerance design are handled in an integrated way. The optimization criterion is based on a single value in terms of the quadratic loss function, and it is selected in order to incorporate both statistical information (such as correlation structure among responses and prediction uncertainty) and economic information relevant to the product or process (such as priorities and trade-offs among responses from the user's point of view). An illustrative application is presented on the design of the elastic element of a force transducer.","combined array,multiresponse optimization,quadratic loss function,robust parameter design","PARAMETER DESIGN,SIMULTANEOUS-OPTIMIZATION,COMPUTER EXPERIMENTS,TAGUCHI","Romano, D@Univ Cagliari, Dept Mech Engn, I-09100 Cagliari, Italy@Politecn Torino, Dept Prod Syst & Econ, I-10129 Turin, Italy@Politecn Torino, Dept Math, I-10129 Turin, Italy::Varetto, M@Univ Cagliari, Dept Mech Engn, I-09100 Cagliari, Italy@Politecn Torino, Dept Prod Syst & Econ, I-10129 Turin, Italy@Politecn Torino, Dept Math, I-10129 Turin, Italy::Vicario, G@Univ Cagliari, Dept Mech Engn, I-09100 Cagliari, Italy@Politecn Torino, Dept Prod Syst & Econ, I-10129 Turin, Italy@Politecn Torino, Dept Math, I-10129 Turin, Italy","Romano, D@University of Cagliari@Polytechnic University of Turin@Polytechnic University of Turin::Varetto, M@University of Cagliari@Polytechnic University of Turin@Polytechnic University of Turin::Vicario, G@University of Cagliari@Polytechnic University of Turin@Polytechnic University of Turin","Romano, Daniele@E-4554-2013","Quality loss functions for optimization across multiple response surfaces+Ames, AE; Mattucci, N; MacDonald, S; et al.+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1997::LOAD-CELL-DESIGN DEVELOPMENTS BY NUMERICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL METHODS+BARBATO, G; DESOGUS, S; ZOMPI, A; et al.+EXPERIMENTAL MECHANICS+1981::no title+BARBATO G+P 22 AIAS C FORL IT+1993::no title+BARBATO G+P 23 AIAS C COS IT+1994::no title+BARBATO G+P 26 AIAS C CAT IT+1997::no title+BISGAARD S+QUALITY ENG+1995::Statistics as a catalyst to learning by scientific method part II - A discussion+Box, GEP+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 1999::THE ROLE OF STRESS-ANALYSIS IN THE DESIGN OF FORCE-STANDARD TRANSDUCERS+BRAY, A+EXPERIMENTAL MECHANICS+1981::no title+Bray, A.; Barbato, G.; Levi, R.+Theory and Practice of Force Measurement+1989::Modified desirability functions for multiple response optimization+DelCastillo, E; Montgomery, DC; McCarville, DR+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1996::SIMULTANEOUS-OPTIMIZATION OF SEVERAL RESPONSE VARIABLES+DERRINGER, G; SUICH, R+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+1980::no title+Graybill, FA.+Theory and application of the linear model+1976::SIMULTANEOUS-OPTIMIZATION OF MULTIPLE RESPONSES REPRESENTED BY POLYNOMIAL REGRESSION-FUNCTIONS+KHURI, AI; CONLON, M+TECHNOMETRICS+1981::An integrated method of parameter design and tolerance design+Li, W.; Wu, C.

Use of Welch-Satterthwaite approximation in calibration of voltage standards,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2004,14,2,"In certifying banks of solid state voltage standards, the customer is provided with predictive equations that are used to predict mean voltage and uncertainty in voltage. These equations are provided for both the bank average and the individual standards constituting the bank over the period of certification, which is typically a year. Use of the Welch-Satterthwaite Approximation (W-SA) can significantly reduce the number of calibrations required to provide satisfactory levels of uncertainty for the bank average. We first review the standard approach in metrology for expressing the uncertainty in a measurement system. We provide an intuitive discussion of the W-SA along with examples of its use and information on its usefulness when there are only a few degrees of freedom. A case study involving a bank of four solid state voltage standards is presented in detail. We also propose an analysis technique that can be used to investigate the usefulness and potential limitations of the W-SA when estimating measurement uncertainties. The analysis technique can be used to estimate approximation error, sampling error, and the coverage probabilities of confidence intervals computed using the W-SA.","degrees of freedom,uncertainty",UNCERTAINTY CALCULATIONS,"Crowder, SV@Unknow::Kupferman, SL@Unknow","Crowder, SV@Unknow::Kupferman, SL@Unknow",not exist,"no title+*ANSI NCSL+Z54021997 ANSI NCSL+no time::Limitations of the Welch-Satterthwaite approximation for measurement uncertainty calculations+Ballico, M+METROLOGIA+2000::no title+EFRON B+INTRO BOOTSRAP+1998::Assessing uncertainty in measurement+Gleser, LJ+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+AUG 1998::Computer modelling of uncertainty calculations with finite degrees of freedom+Hall, BD+MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY+SEP 2000::Does ""Welch-Satterthwaite"" make a good uncertainty estimate?+Hall, BD; Willink, R+METROLOGIA+2001::POSSIBLE NEW EFFECTS IN SUPERCONDUCTIVE TUNNELLING+JOSEPHSON, BD+PHYSICS LETTERS+1962::A STANDARD SCHEME FOR CALCULATING NUMERICALLY STANDARD DEVIATIONS AND CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS+KRAGTEN, J+CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS+APR 1995::An approach to combining results from multiple methods motivated by the ISO GUM+Levenson, MS; Banks, DL; Eberhardt, KR; et al.+JOURNAL OF RESEARCH OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY+JUL-AUG 2000::no title+*NIH US DEP COMM T+NAT VOL LAB ACCR PRO+1994::AN APPROXIMATE DISTRIBUTION OF ESTIMATES OF VARIANCE COMPONENTS+SATTERTHWAITE, FE+BIOMETRICS BULLETIN+1946::MICROFORM CALIBRATION UNCERTAINTIES OF ROCKWELL DIAMOND INDENTERS+SONG, JF; RUDDER, FF; VORBURGER, TV; et al.+JOURNAL OF RESEARCH OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY+SEP-OCT 1995::Interlaboratory comparison of Josephson voltage standards between NIST and Lockheed Martin Astronautics+Tang, YH; Miller, WB+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT+APR 2001::THE GENERALIZATION OF STUDENTS PROBLEM WHEN SEVERAL DIFFERENT POPULATION VARIANCES ARE INVOLVED+WELCH, BL+BIOMETRIKA+1947"

Establishing multivariate specification regions for incoming materials,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2004,40,19,"We present a methodology for establishing meaningful multivariate specification regions on incoming materials or components. The approach uses multivariate PLS regression models to extract information from databases and to relate the properties of incoming materials, and the process variables, to the quality measures on the customer's product. The specification regions are multivariate in nature and are defined in the latent variable space of the PLS model. However, they are easy to implement in practice, and they can provide much insight into what constitutes acceptable material. The approach is illustrated using a simulated process, and is then used to establish multivariate specification regions for polymer resin properties in an industrial film process.","multivariate analysis,partial least squares,quality control","PRODUCT DESIGN,REGRESSION,OPTIMIZATION,QUALITY,CHARTS,MODELS,PLS","Duchesne, C@Univ Laval, Dept Chem Engn, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada@McMaster Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L7, Canada@McMaster Univ, McMaster Adv Control Consortium, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L7, Canada::Macgregor, JF@Univ Laval, Dept Chem Engn, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada@McMaster Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L7, Canada@McMaster Univ, McMaster Adv Control Consortium, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L7, Canada","Duchesne, C@Laval University@McMaster University@McMaster University::Macgregor, JF@Laval University@McMaster University@McMaster University","Carl, Duchesne@B-7890-2008","no title+Anderson, T.+An Introdiction to Multivariate Statistical Analysis+1984::no title+*AUT DIV ASQC+FUND STAT PROC CONTR+1991::no title+BRINKLEY S+ASQC QUAL C T MILW W+1991::Latent variable multivariate regression modeling+Burnham, AJ; MacGregor, JF; Viveros, R+CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS+AUG 2 1999::Frameworks for latent variable multivariate regression+Burnham, AJ; Viveros, R; MacGregor, JF+JOURNAL OF CHEMOMETRICS+JAN-FEB 1996::SIMULTANEOUS-OPTIMIZATION OF SEVERAL RESPONSE VARIABLES+DERRINGER, G; SUICH, R+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+1980::no title+DESMET JA+THESIS MCMASTER U HA+1993::no title+DUCHESNE C+THESIS MCMASTER U HA+2000::no title+Eriksson, L.; Johansson, E.; Kettaneh-Wold, N.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Wold, S</span>.+Multi-and Megavariate Data Analysis.

Three-dimensional variance dispersion graphs for mixture-process experiments,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2004,21,14,"In a mixture experiment, the design factors are the proportions of the components of a mixture, and the response variables depend only on these component proportions. In addition to the mixture components, the experimenter may be interested in other variables that can be varied independently of one another and of the mixture components. Such mixture-process experiments are common in industry. There are many strategies based on different design criteria that are used to create designs involving both types of variables.

Robust parameter design with categorical noise variables,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2003,18,11,"Robust parameter design has been extensively studied and applied in industrial experiments over the past twenty years. The purpose of robust parameter design is to design a process or product that is robust to uncontrollable changes in the noise variables. In many applications the noise variables are continuous, for which several assumptions, often difficult to verify in practice, are necessary to estimate the response variance. In this paper, we consider the case where the noise variable is categorical in nature. We discuss the impact that the assumptions for continuous and categorical noise variables have on the robust settings and on the overall process variance estimate.

The changepoint model for statistical process control,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2003,19,166,"Statistical process control (SPC) requires statistical methodologies that detect changes in the pattern of data over time. The common methodologies, such as Shewhart, cumulative sum (cusum), and exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) charting, require the in-control values of the process parameters, but these are rarely known accurately. Using estimated parameters, the run length behavior changes randomly from one realization to another, making it impossible to control the run length behavior of any particular chart. A suitable methodology for detecting and diagnosing step changes based on imperfect process knowledge is the unknown-parameter changepoint formulation. Long recognized as a Phase I analysis tool, we argue that it is also highly effective in allowing the user to progress seamlessly from the start of Phase I data gathering through Phase II SPC monitoring. Despite not requiring specification of the post-change process parameter values, its performance is never far short of that of the optimal cusum chart which requires this knowledge, and it is far superior for shifts away from the cusum shift for which the cusum chart is optimal. As another benefit, while changepoint methods are designed for step changes that persist, they are also competitive with the Shewhart chart, the chart of choice for isolated non-sustained special causes.","cumulative sum control charts,exponentially weighted moving average control charts,Shewhart control charts","CHANGE-POINT,CONTROL CHARTS,INFERENCE,(X)OVER-BAR,SEQUENCE,LOCATION,LIMITS,TESTS,SHIFT","Hawkins, DM@Univ Minnesota, Sch Stat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA@Hanyang Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Seoul 133791, South Korea::Qiu, PH@Univ Minnesota, Sch Stat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA@Hanyang Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Seoul 133791, South Korea::Kang, CW@Univ Minnesota, Sch Stat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA@Hanyang Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Seoul 133791, South Korea","Hawkins, DM@University of Minnesota Twin Cities@University of Minnesota System@Hanyang University::Qiu, PH@University of Minnesota Twin Cities@University of Minnesota System@Hanyang University::Kang, CW@University of Minnesota Twin Cities@University of Minnesota System@Hanyang University",not exist,"Process control and statistical inference+Crowder, SV; Hawkins, DM; Reynolds, MR; et al.+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 1997::Sequential change-point detection with likelihood ratios+Gombay, E+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+AUG 15 2000::no title+Hawkins, D.

In the retrospective stage (Phase I) analysis of a historical data set, the presence of multiple outliers may go undetected by the conventional T-2 chart, due to masking. In this paper we propose T-2 control charts based on robust estimators of location and dispersion.

Fraction of design space to assess prediction capability of response surface designs,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2003,13,55,"Variance Dispersion Graphs (VDGs) are useful summaries for comparing competing designs on a fixed design space. However, they do not give all useful information about the prediction capability of a design. We propose the Fraction of Design Space (FDS) technique, which addresses some of the shortcomings of VDGs. The new technique gives the researcher more detailed information by quantifying the fraction of design space where the scaled prediction variance (SPV) is less than or equal to any pre-specified value. The FDS graph gives the researcher information about the distribution of the SPV in the region based on the ranges and proportions of possible SPV values. Several variations on the graph, including plotting the variance of the estimated mean response, are also presented to allow for specialized consideration of different designs. The FDS technique complements the use of VDGs to give the researcher more insight into the prediction capability of a design. Several standard designs with different numbers of factors are studied with both methods.","alphabetic optimality,design optimization,prediction variance,variance dispersion graph",VARIANCE,"Zahran, A@Cairo Univ, Dept Stat, Cairo, Egypt@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Anderson-Cook, CM@Cairo Univ, Dept Stat, Cairo, Egypt@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Myers, RH@Cairo Univ, Dept Stat, Cairo, Egypt@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Zahran, A@Cairo University@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Anderson-Cook, CM@Cairo University@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Myers, RH@Cairo University@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University",not exist,"Some new three level designs for the study of quantitative variables+Box, G.

Modifying 2(2) factorial designs to accommodate a restricted design space,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2003,11,1,"With standard designs we typically assume that the factor space is a p-dimensional hypercube or hypersphere, with any point inside or on the boundary of the shape being a candidate design point. However, some economical, practical, or physical constraints may occur on the factor settings resulting in an irregular experimental region. One often encounters situations in which it is necessary to eliminate some portion of the design space where it is infeasible or impractical to collect experimental data. Hence, standard designs are not always feasible, and the need arises for best possible designs under these restrictions. For the two-factor case with one corner of the square design space excluded, we propose a strategy for defining the new design space and three designs. These involve either reducing the factor levels to make a smaller but standard factorial design fit or modifying the levels of the variables at the excluded corner to locate the runs in the feasible design region. We discuss properties of these designs and relative tradeoffs.","alphabetic optimality,design of experiments,linear models",COMPUTER-AIDED-DESIGN,"Zahran, A@Cairo Univ, Dept Stat, Cairo, Egypt@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Anderson-Cook, CM@Cairo Univ, Dept Stat, Cairo, Egypt@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Myers, RH@Cairo Univ, Dept Stat, Cairo, Egypt@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Smith, EP@Cairo Univ, Dept Stat, Cairo, Egypt@Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Zahran, A@Cairo University@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Anderson-Cook, CM@Cairo University@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Myers, RH@Cairo University@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Smith, EP@Cairo University@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University",not exist,"no title+Atkinson, A.C.; Donev, A.N.+Optimum Experimental Designs+1992::MULTI-FACTOR EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGNS FOR EXPLORING RESPONSE SURFACES+BOX, GEP; HUNTER, JS+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1957::ROBUST DESIGNS+BOX, GEP; DRAPER, NR+BIOMETRIKA+1975::DESIGNS IN 3 AND 4 COMPONENTS FOR MIXTURES MODELS WITH INVERSE TERMS+DRAPER, NR; STJOHN, RC+TECHNOMETRICS+1977::SOME GUIDELINES FOR CONSTRUCTING EXACT D-OPTIMAL DESIGNS ON CONVEX DESIGN SPACES+JOHNSON, ME; NACHTSHEIM, CJ+TECHNOMETRICS+1983::no title+KENNARD RW+TECHNOMETRICS+1969::The equivalence of two extremum problems+Kiefer, J.; Wolfowitz, J.+Canad.

We derive the proper Cuscore statistic that will identify spike signals in a dynamic system that is subject to feedback control. We then apply this Cuscore statistic to the output error from the control scheme.

The popular formulations of the dual response problem typically impose a restriction on the value of the secondary response (i.e., keeping the standard deviation below a specified value) and optimize the primary response function (i.e., maximize or minimize the mean). Restrictions on the secondary response, however, may rule out better conditions, since an acceptable value for the secondary response is usually unknown. In fact, process conditons that result in a smaller standard deviation are often preferable. A more flexible formulation of the problem can be achieved by considering the secondary response as another primary response. The proposed method will generate more alternative solutions, called Pareto optimal solutions. This gives more flexibility to the decision-maker in exploring alternative solutions. It is also insightful to examine graphically how the controllable variables simultaneously impact the mean and standard deviation. The procedure is illustrated with three examples, using both the NIMBUS software for nonlinear multiobjective programming and the Solver in the Excel spreadsheet.","dual response optimization,quality improvement,response surface methodology,simultaneous optimization,Taguchi's robust parameter design","SYSTEMS,TAGUCHI","Koksoy, O@Nigde Univ, Dept Math, Nigde, Turkey@GE Co, Global Res Ctr, Appl Stat Lab, Schenectady, NY 12301 USA","Koksoy, O@Omer Halis Demir University@General Electric",not exist,"no title+Box, G.E.P.; Draper, H.R.+Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces+1987::Optimization problems and methods in quality control and improvement+Carlyle, WM; Montgomery, DC; Runger, GC+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2000::Analyzing experiments with correlated multiple responses+Chiao, CH; Hamada, M+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 2001::Dual response optimization via direct function minimization+Copeland, KAF; Nelson, PR+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1996::The computation of global optima in dual response systems+DelCastillo, E; Fan, SK; Semple, J+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1997::A NONLINEAR-PROGRAMMING SOLUTION TO THE DUAL RESPONSE PROBLEM+DELCASTILLO, E; MONTGOMERY, DC+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1993::RIDGE ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE SURFACES+DRAPER, NR+TECHNOMETRICS+1963::A generalized global optimization algorithm for dual response systems+Fan, SKS+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 2000::no title+HOERL AE+CHEM ENG PROGR+1959::Multiresponse surface methodology+Khuri, A.

GLMs for the analysis of robust designs with dynamic characteristics,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2003,18,21,"Robust designs with dynamic characteristics, also called signal-response systems, are used in practice to determine control settings which make a system's performance robust over a wide range of input conditions. In this paper, we review existing methods for their analysis and propose the use of a joint generalized linear model. The joint model approach is based on standard regression modelling techniques so that model assumptions can be investigated using residual analysis. It has the advantage that it uses all of the data rather than relying on summary statistics, and the approach is applicable to a wide range of response types.","dynamic characteristics,generalized linear models,robust design,signal-response system","GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,SIGNAL-RESPONSE SYSTEMS,PARAMETER DESIGN","Lesperance, ML@Univ Victoria, Dept Math & Stat, Victoria, BC V8W 3P4, Canada@Samsung Elect Canada Inc, Mississauga, ON L5N 6R3, Canada","Lesperance, ML@University of Victoria@Samsung",not exist,"no title+*AM SUPPL I+ROB DES US TAG METH+1998::no title+no author+Statistical Models in S+1992::PARAMETER ORTHOGONALITY AND APPROXIMATE CONDITIONAL INFERENCE+COX, DR; REID, N+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1987::no title+Dobson,, A.

Constructing meta-models for computer experiments,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2003,27,18,"We used three test functions to compare all combinations of five experimental design classes with either second-order response surface (RS) or kriging modeling methods. The findings included the following: 1) conclusions about which method performed best, even for a single case study, greatly depended on the specific experimental designs used to represent each class of designs; 2) unavoidable bias errors constituted the largest source of prediction errors when regression modeling was used with designs generated to address bias errors; and 3) estimation errors, which could be attributed to the use of the likelihood estimation objective, dominated prediction errors in kriging modeling. We tentatively conclude that, for cases in which the number of runs is comparable to the number of terms in a quadratic polynomial model, similar prediction errors can be expected from both kriging and regression modeling procedures as long as regression is used in combination with experimental designs generated to address bias errors.","expected integrated mean squared error,Kriging models,optimal experimental design,response surface methods",DESIGN,"Allen, TT@Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA@Sagat Limitee, Montreal, PQ H3X 2B5, Canada::Bernshteyn, MA@Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA@Sagat Limitee, Montreal, PQ H3X 2B5, Canada::Kabiri-Bamoradian, K@Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA@Sagat Limitee, Montreal, PQ H3X 2B5, Canada","Allen, TT@Ohio State University@Unknow::Bernshteyn, MA@Ohio State University@Unknow::Kabiri-Bamoradian, K@Ohio State University@Unknow","Allen, Theodore@P-3387-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9522-3252","Low cost response surface methods applied to the design of plastic snap fits+Allen, T.T.; Yu, L.; Bernshteyn, M.+Quality Engineering+2000::no title+ALLEN TT+J ROYAL STAT SOC C+2002::Low-cost response surface methods from simulation optimization+Allen, TT; Yu, LY+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+JAN-FEB 2002::no title+BOOKER AJ+P SECT PHYS ENG SCI+1996::no title+Box, G.E.P.; Draper, H.R.+Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces+1987::A SIMPLE BAYESIAN MODIFICATION OF D-OPTIMAL DESIGNS TO REDUCE DEPENDENCE ON AN ASSUMED MODEL+DUMOUCHEL, W; JONES, B+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1994::no title+Fang, K.-T.; Wang, Y.+Number-theoretic Methods in statistics+1993::no title+FANG KT+TECHNOMETRICS+2000::A genetic algorithm for the multiple-choice integer program+Hadj-Alouane, A.B.; Bean, J.C.+Operations Research+1997::no title+HARTELIUS K+THESIS TU DENMARK+1996::MINIMAX AND MAXIMIN DISTANCE DESIGNS+JOHNSON, ME; MOORE, LM; YLVISAKER, D+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+OCT 1990::The use of FEA and design of experiments to establish design guidelines for simple hydroformed parts+Koc, M; Allen, T; Jiratheranat, S; et al.+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE TOOLS &amp; MANUFACTURE+DEC 2000::Principles of geostatistics+Matheron,, G.+Economic Geology+1963::Comparing experimental design strategies for quality improvement with minimal changes to factor levels+McDaniel, WR; Ankenman, BE+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+SEP-OCT 2000::A COMPARISON OF THREE METHODS FOR SELECTING VALUES OF INPUT VARIABLES IN THE ANALYSIS OF OUTPUT FROM A COMPUTER CODE+MCKAY, MD; BECKMAN, RJ; CONOVER, WJ+TECHNOMETRICS+1979::no title+MONTGOMERY, D.

A unifying view of some process adjustment methods,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2003,19,21,"We consider the problem of adjusting a machine that starts production after an off-target setup operation. This setup adjustment problem was first studied by Grubbs (1954, 1983). A general formulation for setup adjustment problems is presented in this paper. The formulation unifies some well-known process adjustment schemes, including Grubbs' harmonic and extended rules, adjustment methods based on stochastic approximation and recursive least squares, and a recent method on adaptive EWMA feedback controllers. The proposed formulation is Bayesian and based on a Kalman filter. The formulation allows us to show the equivalence of the setup process adjustment problem with a simple instance of what is called a Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller in the control engineering literature. As an important byproduct, the LQG model allows us to solve more complicated setup adjustment problems with readily available techniques. Extensions to cases in which there are quadratic adjustment costs and in which the problem is multivariate are discussed. The multivariate setup adjustment solution is illustrated with a multihead filling machine example.","engineering process control,Kalman filtering,linear quadratic control,setup adjustment,Stochastic approximation",RUN,"Del Castillo, E@Penn State Univ, Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA@Univ Texas, Mech & Ind Engn Dept, El Paso, TX 79968 USA@Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Meccan, I-20133 Milan, Italy::Pan, R@Penn State Univ, Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA@Univ Texas, Mech & Ind Engn Dept, El Paso, TX 79968 USA@Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Meccan, I-20133 Milan, Italy::Colosimo, BM@Penn State Univ, Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA@Univ Texas, Mech & Ind Engn Dept, El Paso, TX 79968 USA@Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Meccan, I-20133 Milan, Italy","Del Castillo, E@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University@University of Texas El Paso@University of Texas System@Polytechnic University of Milan::Pan, R@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University@University of Texas El Paso@University of Texas System@Polytechnic University of Milan::Colosimo, BM@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University@University of Texas El Paso@University of Texas System@Polytechnic University of Milan","Colosimo, Bianca@C-1081-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6844-2030","no title+Astrom, K.

Separating location and dispersion effects in unreplicated fractional factorial designs,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2003,18,5,"Fractional factorial designs are often used in industry to screen potentially important factors in terms of their impact on the mean response, that is, their location effect. To save resources, these experiments are often unreplicated, in that only one observation is made at each design point. In addition to studying location effects, these designs may also be used to study dispersion effects. One of the difficulties in studying dispersion in these unreplicated designs is that dispersion effects are confounded with pairs of location effects. In this paper, we investigate the situation where a single dispersion effect is identified. We develop a procedure to determine the minimum number of additional runs needed to totally remove the confounding between this dispersion effect and two location effects. For situations where replication is not feasible, we develop a test for a pair of unidentified location effects conditioned on a single dispersion effect being detected. An example from the literature is used to demonstrate these two procedures.","confounding,dispersion,fractional,factorial designs,variance",,"McGrath, RN@Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Appl Stat & Operat Res, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA","McGrath, RN@Bowling Green State University",not exist,"Dispersion effects from unreplicated designs in the 2(k-p) series+Bergman, B; Hynen, A+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 1997::no title+Box, G.

On the monitoring of linear profiles,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2003,30,214,"We propose control chart methods for process monitoring when the quality of a process or product is characterized by a linear function. In the historical analysis of Phase I data, we recommend methods including the use of a bivariate T-2 chart to check for stability of the regression coefficients in conjunction with a univariate Shewhart chart to check for stability of the variation about the regression line. We recommend the use of three univariate control charts in Phase II. These three charts are used to monitor the Y-intercept, the slope, and the variance of the deviations about the regression line, respectively. A simulation study shows that this type of Phase II method can detect sustained shifts in the parameters better than competing methods in terms of average run length performance. We also relate the monitoring of linear profiles to the control charting of regression-adjusted variables and other methods.","calibration,exponentially weighted,moving average control chart,multivariate T-2 control charts,statistical process control","REGRESSION-ADJUSTED VARIABLES,MULTIVARIATE QUALITY-CONTROL,CONTROL CHARTS,CURVES,PERFORMANCE,DESIGN,EWMA","Kim, K@Virginia Tech, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Mahmoud, MA@Virginia Tech, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA::Woodall, WH@Virginia Tech, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Kim, K@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Mahmoud, MA@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University::Woodall, WH@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University",not exist,"A comparison of control charting procedures for monitoring process dispersion+Acosta-Mejia, CA; Pignatiello, JJ; Rao, BV+IIE TRANSACTIONS+JUN 1999::no title+ALBIN SL+COMMUNICATION+2002::Optimal changepoint tests for normal linear regression+Andrews, DWK; Lee, I; Ploberger, W+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JAN 1996::A Case Study for Control Charting a Product Quality Measure That is a Continuous Function Over Time+Brill, R.

Gauge R&R analysis for two-dimensional data with circular tolerances,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2003,22,12,"We consider gauge repeatability and reproducibility (R&R) analyses for two-dimensional data when the engineering tolerance associated with measurements is a circle. We develop summaries for repeatability, reproducibility, and R&R by employing the diameters of circles that provide 99% capture rates. We derive an inequality between the results of a one-dimensional gauge R&R method and this two-dimensional method. We also show that the additivity-of-variance in the one-dimensional gauge R&R case becomes a sub-additivity-of-variance in the two-dimensional case under certain conditions. We use measurements of unbalance of rotating devices, where the tolerance must be a: circle, to motivate the ideas and to illustrate the technique. Our results apply to corresponding coordinate-measuring-machine data when the engineering tolerance is a circle. The method can be extended to other problems, including square and spherical tolerances. We recommend that this method be used in conjunction with graphical, other univariate, and multivariate analyses.","measurement systems analysis,tolerances,two-dimensional data",MULTIVARIATE,"Voelkel, JG@Rochester Inst Technol, John D Hromi Ctr Qual & Appl Stat, Rochester, NY 14623 USA","Voelkel, JG@Rochester Institute of Technology",not exist,"no title+*AIAG+STAT PROC CONTR+1992::LEAST-SQUARES ESTIMATION OF COVARIANCE MATRICES IN BALANCED MULTIVARIATE VARIANCE-COMPONENTS MODELS+CALVIN, JA; DYKSTRA, RL+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1991::A MULTIVARIATE PROCESS CAPABILITY INDEX OVER A RECTANGULAR SOLID TOLERANCE ZONE+CHEN, HF+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 1994::The distribution of a linear combination of x2 random variables+Davies, R.

Semiparametric exact optimal run orders,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2003,20,1,"When performing an experiment, the observed responses are often influenced by a temporal trend possibly due to aging of material, learning effects, equipment wear-out, or warm-up effects. The construction of run orders that are optimally balanced for time trend effects usually relies on the incorporation of a parametric representation of the time dependence. Using a parametric approach works very well as long as the unknown time dependence is properly specified or overspecified. However, for complicated temporal trends of unknown periodicity, or when the design size is small compared to the complexity of the response model, a parametric approach may lead to underspecification of the true time trend. Serious problems of bias can result. In this paper we show that, contrary to a fully parametric approach with an underfitted time trend, modeling the time trend non parametrically is very attractive in terms of both bias and precision of the parameter estimators. An algorithm is presented for the construction of optimal run orders when kernel smoothing is used to model the temporal trend. An industrial example illustrates the practical utility of the proposed design methodology.","design of experiments,optimal design,simulated annealing,trends","KERNEL REGRESSION,BLOCK-DESIGNS,TREND","Tack, L@Katholieke Univ Leuven, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium::Vandebroek, M@Katholieke Univ Leuven, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium","Tack, L@KU Leuven::Vandebroek, M@KU Leuven","Vandebroek, Martina@J-9103-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0317-1986","Experimental designs optimally balanced for trend+Atkinson, AC; Donev, AN+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1996::FACTORIAL DESIGNS, [X'X] CRITERION, AND SOME RELATED MATTERS+BOX, MJ; DRAPER, NR+TECHNOMETRICS+1971::TREND-FREE BLOCK-DESIGNS - THEORY+BRADLEY, RA; YEH, CM+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1980::no title+BUTLER NA+983 U READ+1989::no title+BUTLER NA+992A U READ+1990::NONPARAMETRIC ESTIMATION OF A SMOOTH REGRESSION FUNCTION+CLARK, RM+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::SMOOTHING NOISY DATA WITH SPLINE FUNCTIONS - ESTIMATING THE CORRECT DEGREE OF SMOOTHING BY THE METHOD OF GENERALIZED CROSS-VALIDATION+CRAVEN, P; WAHBA, G+NUMERISCHE MATHEMATIK+1979::no title+DRAPER NR+APPL REGRESSION ANAL+1968::NON-PARAMETRIC ESTIMATION OF A MULTIVARIATE PROBABILITY DENSITY+EPANECHN.VA+THEORY OF PROBILITY AND ITS APPLICATIONS,USSR+1969::no title+FARAWAY J+174 U MIHCIGAN+1989::no title+FARAWAY J+177 U MICH+1990::KERNELS FOR NONPARAMETRIC CURVE ESTIMATION+GASSER, T; MULLER, HG; MAMMITZSCH, V+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1985::ANALYSIS OF FIELD EXPERIMENTS BY LEAST-SQUARES SMOOTHING+GREEN, P; JENNISON, C; SEHEULT, A+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1985::no title+Hardle, W.+Applied Nonparametric Regression+1990::OPTIMAL DESIGNS FOR NONPARAMETRIC KERNEL REGRESSION+MULLER, HG+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+1984::BOUNDARY MODIFICATION FOR KERNEL REGRESSION+RICE, J+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1984::KERNEL SMOOTHING IN PARTIAL LINEAR-MODELS+SPECKMAN, P+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1988::Trend-resistant and cost-efficient block designs with fixed or random block effects+Tack, L; Vandebroek, M+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 2002::(D-t, C)-optimal run orders+Tack, L; Vandebroek, M+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+OCT 1 2001::no title+TACK L+UNPUB TRENDS RESISTA+2002"
Row-column response surface designs,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2003,18,3,"Factorial experiments are widely used in industry to investigate the effects of process factors on quality response variables. Many food processes, for example, are not only subject to variation between days, but also between different times of the day. Removing this variation using blocking factors leads to row-column designs. In this paper, an algorithm is described for constructing factorial row-column designs when the factors are quantitative, and the data are to be analysed by fitting a polynomial model. The row-column designs are constructed using an iterative interchange search, where interchanges that result in an improvement in the weighted mean of the efficiency factors corresponding to the parameters of interest are accepted. Some examples illustrating the performance of the algorithm are given.","central composite design,optimal design,second order model","FACTORIAL-DESIGNS,BLOCKING","Gilmour, SG@Univ London Queen Mary & Westfield Coll, London E1 4NS, England@Univ Estadual Paulista Julio Mesquita Filho, BR-18618000 Botucatu, SP, Brazil::Trinca, LA@Univ London Queen Mary & Westfield Coll, London E1 4NS, England@Univ Estadual Paulista Julio Mesquita Filho, BR-18618000 Botucatu, SP, Brazil","Gilmour, SG@University of London@Queen Mary University London@Universidade Estadual Paulista::Trinca, LA@University of London@Queen Mary University London@Universidade Estadual Paulista","Trinca, Luzia@C-7849-2012","THE CONSTRUCTION OF EXACT D-OPTIMUM EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGNS WITH APPLICATION TO BLOCKING RESPONSE-SURFACE DESIGNS+ATKINSON, AC; DONEV, AN+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1989::no title+Box, G.E.P.; Draper, H.R.+Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces+1987::COMPUTER-AIDED BLOCKING OF FACTORIAL AND RESPONSE-SURFACE DESIGNS+COOK, RD; NACHTSHEIM, CJ+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 1989::AGRICULTURAL RESPONSE-SURFACE EXPERIMENTS BASED ON 4-LEVEL FACTORIAL-DESIGNS+EDMONDSON, RN+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1991::Some practical advice on polynomial regression analysis from blocked response surface designs+Gilmour, SG; Trinca, LA+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2000::no title+JOHN, J.

The Bayesian approach easily handles a general calibration relationship, say nonlinear, with nonnormal errors. The population may also be general, say lognormal, for quantities which are nonnegative.

Predicting processes when embedded events occur: Dynamic time warping,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,APR 2003,11,2,"In a traditional time-series analysis one assumes a model for the system. This model has a specified form that is consistent over time. However, in most continuous processes changing tank levels, system upsets (events), and transient process behaviors impact the accuracy of forecasts based on these global models. System behavior is often more closely related to local (short-term) process conditions and events that are repeated at random over time. The global model can predict average behavior, but it often does not accurately predict the local behavior of such a system. The traditional purpose of dynamic time warping was to detect predetermined patterns in speech recognition (time-series data). The technique depends on the development of templates, which represent known patterns or behavior. In this paper we extend the dynamic time warping technique to forecast process measurements using recent process data to define a (dynamic) template. This new dynamic template, dynamic-time-warping approach is compared to traditional methods of predicting process measurements when behavior typical of a continuous process is present. The key properties of such processes are described. The dynamic time warping approach is shown to be an effective method of prediction under these process assumptions.","forecasting techniques,time-series analysis",,"Nelson, BJ@Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA@Weyerhaeuser Co, Tacoma, WA 98477 USA::Runger, GC@Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA@Weyerhaeuser Co, Tacoma, WA 98477 USA","Nelson, BJ@Arizona State University@Unknow::Runger, GC@Arizona State University@Unknow",not exist,"Finding patterns in time series: a dynamic programming approach+Berndt, D.J; Clifford, J.+ADV KNOWLEDGE DISCOV+1996::no title+BOX G+TIME SERIES ANAL+1994::A method for predicting future observations in the monitoring of a batch process+Cho, HW; Kim, KJ+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2003::AUTOMATIC CLASSIFICATION AND ANALYSIS OF MICRONEUROGRAPHIC SPIKE DATA USING A PC/AT+FORSTER, C; HANDWERKER, HO+JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS+FEB 1990::Supervision of bioprocesses using a dynamic time warping algorithm+Gollmer, K; Posten, C+CONTROL ENGINEERING PRACTICE+SEP 1996::no title+GRANT PM+ELECT COMMUNICAT FEB+1991::no title+MacDonald, I.

Robust design via generalized linear models,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2003,34,47,"A single data transformation may fail to satisfy all the required properties necessary for an analysis. With generalized linear models (GLMs), the identification of the mean-variance relationship and the choice of the scale on which the effects are to be measured can be done separately, overcoming the shortcomings of the data-transformation approach. GLMs also provide an extension of the response surface approach.

Analysis of supersaturated designs,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2003,24,30,"Supersaturated designs offer a potentially useful way to investigate many factors with very few experimental runs. These designs are used to investigate m factors with n experimental runs, where m > n - 1. We evaluate several methods for analyzing a broad range of supersaturated designs and provide a basic explanation of these procedures. We show that the contrasts of a supersaturated design follow a permuted multivariate hypergeometric distribution, which may be approximated with a normal distribution. The analysis methods presented are based on methods for unreplicated fractional factorial designs. Two contrast-based analysis methods are presented, and the assumptions of the underlying model are described for a wide range of supersaturated designs.","contrasts,factorial designs,screening",CONSTRUCTION,"Holcomb, DR@Honeywell Engines & Syst, Phoenix, AZ 85034 USA@Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA@USN, Postgrad Sch, Monterey, CA 93943 USA::Montgomery, DC@Honeywell Engines & Syst, Phoenix, AZ 85034 USA@Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA@USN, Postgrad Sch, Monterey, CA 93943 USA::Carlyle, WM@Honeywell Engines & Syst, Phoenix, AZ 85034 USA@Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA@USN, Postgrad Sch, Monterey, CA 93943 USA","Holcomb, DR@Honeywell@Arizona State University@United States Department of Defense@United States Navy@Naval Postgraduate School::Montgomery, DC@Honeywell@Arizona State University@United States Department of Defense@United States Navy@Naval Postgraduate School::Carlyle, WM@Honeywell@Arizona State University@United States Department of Defense@United States Navy@Naval Postgraduate School",not exist,"Some risks in the construction and analysis of supersaturated designs+Abraham, B; Chipman, H; Vijayan, K+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 1999::SOME SYSTEMATIC SUPERSATURATED DESIGNS+BOOTH, KHV; COX, DR+TECHNOMETRICS+1962::no title+BOX GEP+TECHNOMETRICS+1959::On the identifiability of a supersaturated design+Chen, JH; Lin, DKJ+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+SEP 1 1998::Use of half-normal plots in interpreting factorial two level experiments+Daniel, C.+Technometrics+1959::Analyzing unreplicated factorial experiments: A review with some new proposals+Hamada, M; Balakrishnan, N+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 1998::Some notes on the construction and evaluation of supersaturated designs+Holcomb, DR; Carlyle, WM+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+JUL-AUG 2002::no title+HOLCOMB DR+THESIS ARIZONA STATE+2000::no title+Johnson, NL; Kotz, S; Balakrishnan, N.+Discrete multivariate distributions+1997::QUICK AND EASY ANALYSIS OF UNREPLICATED FACTORIALS+LENTH, RV+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1989::no title+LIN DKJ+STAT PROCESS MONITOR+2000::no title+LIN DKJ+TECHNOMETRICS+1995::A NEW CLASS OF SUPERSATURATED DESIGNS+LIN, DKJ+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1993::A permutation test for effects in an unreplicated factorial design+Loughin, TM; Noble, W+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 1997::no title+Montgomery, DC.+Design and analysis of experiments+2001::An algorithmic approach to constructing supersaturated designs+Nguyen, NK+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1996::Random balance experimentation (with discussions)+Satterthwaite, F.

Genetic algorithms for the construction of D-optimal designs,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2003,32,47,"Computer-generated designs are useful for situations where standard factorial, fractional factorial or response surface designs cannot be easily employed. Alphabetically-optimal designs are the most widely used type of computer-generated designs, and of these, the D-optimal (or D-efficient) class of designs is extremely popular. D-optimal designs are usually constructed by algorithms that sequentially add and delete points from a potential design by using a candidate set of points spaced over the region of interest. We present a technique to generate D-efficient designs using genetic algorithms (GA). This approach eliminates the need to explicitly consider a candidate set of experimental points and it can be used in highly constrained regions while maintaining a level of performance comparable to more traditional design construction techniques.","computer-aided design,design of experiments,design optimality,D-optimality","COMPUTER-AIDED-DESIGN,MIXTURE,MODELS","Heredia-Langner, A@Pacific NW Natl Lab, Stat & Quantitat Sci Grp, Richland, WA 99352 USA@USN, Postgrad Sch, Dept Operat Res, Monterey, CA 93943 USA@Arizona State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA::Carlyle, WM@Pacific NW Natl Lab, Stat & Quantitat Sci Grp, Richland, WA 99352 USA@USN, Postgrad Sch, Dept Operat Res, Monterey, CA 93943 USA@Arizona State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA::Montgomery, DC@Pacific NW Natl Lab, Stat & Quantitat Sci Grp, Richland, WA 99352 USA@USN, Postgrad Sch, Dept Operat Res, Monterey, CA 93943 USA@Arizona State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA::Borror, CM@Pacific NW Natl Lab, Stat & Quantitat Sci Grp, Richland, WA 99352 USA@USN, Postgrad Sch, Dept Operat Res, Monterey, CA 93943 USA@Arizona State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA::Runger, GC@Pacific NW Natl Lab, Stat & Quantitat Sci Grp, Richland, WA 99352 USA@USN, Postgrad Sch, Dept Operat Res, Monterey, CA 93943 USA@Arizona State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Heredia-Langner, A@Pacific Northwest National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)@United States Navy@United States Department of Defense@Naval Postgraduate School@Arizona State University::Carlyle, WM@Pacific Northwest National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)@United States Navy@United States Department of Defense@Naval Postgraduate School@Arizona State University::Montgomery, DC@Pacific Northwest National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)@United States Navy@United States Department of Defense@Naval Postgraduate School@Arizona State University::Borror, CM@Pacific Northwest National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)@United States Navy@United States Department of Defense@Naval Postgraduate School@Arizona State University::Runger, GC@Pacific Northwest National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)@United States Navy@United States Department of Defense@Naval Postgraduate School@Arizona State University",not exist,"no title+ALANDER JT+PRACTICAL HDB GENETI+1999::no title+Ansari, N; Hou, E.+Computational Intelligence for Optimization+1997::no title+Back, Thomas.+Evolutionary algorithms in theory and practice-evolution strategies, evolutionary programming, genetic algorithms+1996::Production Scheduling and Rescheduling with Genetic Algorithms+Bierwirth, Christian; Mattfeld, Dirk C.+EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION+SPR 1999::no title+Box, G.

Systematic patterns in T-2 charts,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2003,21,17,"Nonrandom or systematic patterns occurring in a univariate Shewhart control chart have often been used as indicators of extraneous sources of process variation. Proper diagnosis of these patterns can lead to process improvement by reducing the overall system variation. Similarly, in multivariate statistical process control, many different systematic patterns may occur in the control charts used to monitor the process. The purpose of this paper is to examine the process conditions that lead to the occurrence of certain nonrandom patterns in a T-2 control chart. Examples resulting from cycles, mixtures, trends, process shifts, and autocorrelated data are identified and presented. Results are applicable to a Phase I operation or a Phase II operation where the T-2 statistic is based on the most common covariance matrix estimator.","autocorrelation,multivariate statistical process control,trends",MULTIVARIATE CONTROL CHARTS,"Mason, RL@SW Res Inst, San Antonio, TX 78228 USA@Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Math, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA@Mississippi State Univ, Coll Business & Ind, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA@Rutgers State Univ, Chair Dept Management Sci & Informat Syst, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA@McNeese State Univ, Dept Math Stat & Comp Sci, Lake Charles, LA 70609 USA::Chou, YM@SW Res Inst, San Antonio, TX 78228 USA@Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Math, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA@Mississippi State Univ, Coll Business & Ind, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA@Rutgers State Univ, Chair Dept Management Sci & Informat Syst, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA@McNeese State Univ, Dept Math Stat & Comp Sci, Lake Charles, LA 70609 USA::Sullivan, JH@SW Res Inst, San Antonio, TX 78228 USA@Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Math, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA@Mississippi State Univ, Coll Business & Ind, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA@Rutgers State Univ, Chair Dept Management Sci & Informat Syst, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA@McNeese State Univ, Dept Math Stat & Comp Sci, Lake Charles, LA 70609 USA::Stoumbos, ZG@SW Res Inst, San Antonio, TX 78228 USA@Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Math, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA@Mississippi State Univ, Coll Business & Ind, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA@Rutgers State Univ, Chair Dept Management Sci & Informat Syst, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA@McNeese State Univ, Dept Math Stat & Comp Sci, Lake Charles, LA 70609 USA::Young, JC@SW Res Inst, San Antonio, TX 78228 USA@Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Math, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA@Mississippi State Univ, Coll Business & Ind, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA@Rutgers State Univ, Chair Dept Management Sci & Informat Syst, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA@McNeese State Univ, Dept Math Stat & Comp Sci, Lake Charles, LA 70609 USA","Mason, RL@Southwest Research Institute@University of Texas System@University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA)@Mississippi State University@Rutgers State University New Brunswick@University of Louisiana System@McNeese State University::Chou, YM@Southwest Research Institute@University of Texas System@University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA)@Mississippi State University@Rutgers State University New Brunswick@University of Louisiana System@McNeese State University::Sullivan, JH@Southwest Research Institute@University of Texas System@University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA)@Mississippi State University@Rutgers State University New Brunswick@University of Louisiana System@McNeese State University::Stoumbos, ZG@Southwest Research Institute@University of Texas System@University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA)@Mississippi State University@Rutgers State University New Brunswick@University of Louisiana System@McNeese State University::Young, JC@Southwest Research Institute@University of Texas System@University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA)@Mississippi State University@Rutgers State University New Brunswick@University of Louisiana System@McNeese State University",not exist,"no title+Anderson, T.+An Introdiction to Multivariate Statistical Analysis+1984::no title+BOZZELLO ML+THESIS U SO ILLINOIS+1989::EXACT RESULTS FOR SHEWHART CONTROL CHARTS WITH SUPPLEMENTARY RUNS RULES+CHAMP, CW; WOODALL, WH+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1987::Power comparisons for a Hotelling's T-2 statistic+Chou, YM; Mason, RL; Young, JC+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+1999::no title+Fuchs, C.; Kenett, R.+Multivariate Quality Control with Industrial Applications+1998::REGRESSION ADJUSTMENT FOR VARIABLES IN MULTIVARIATE QUALITY-CONTROL+HAWKINS, DM+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1993::no title+HOLMES DS+QUAL ENG+1993::The performance of multivariate control charts in the presence of measurement error+Linna, KW; Woodall, WH; Busby, KL+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 2001::ASASIAM series on statistics and applied mathematics+Mason, R.

A method for predicting future observations in the monitoring of a batch process,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2003,15,24,"Batch processes play an important role in the production of low-volume, high-value products such as polymers, pharmaceuticals, and biochemicals. Multiway Principal Components Analysis (MPCA), one of the multivariate projection methods, has been widely used for monitoring batch processes. One major problem in the on-line application of MPCA is that the input data matrix for MPCA is not complete until the end of the batch operation, and thus the unmeasured portion of the matrix (called the ""future observations"") has to be predicted. In this paper we propose a new method for predicting the future observations of the batch that is currently being operated (called the ""new batch""). The proposed method, unlike the existing prediction methods, makes extensive use of the past batch trajectories. The past batch trajectory which is deemed the most similar to the new batch is selected from the batch library and used as the basis for predicting the unknown part of the new batch. A case study on an industrial PVC batch process has been conducted. The results show that the proposed method results in more accurate prediction and has the capability of detecting process abnormalities earlier than the existing methods.","batch process,monitoring,principal component analysis",PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS,"Cho, HW@Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Div Mech & Ind Engn, Pohang 790784, Kyungbuk, South Korea::Kim, KJ@Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Div Mech & Ind Engn, Pohang 790784, Kyungbuk, South Korea","Cho, HW@Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH)::Kim, KJ@Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH)","Kim, Kwang-Jae@F-6959-2013","Multivariate statistical monitoring of batch processes: an industrial case study of fermentation supervision+Albert, S; Kinley, RD+TRENDS IN BIOTECHNOLOGY+FEB 2001::Batch tracking via nonlinear principal component analysis+Dong, D; McAvoy, TJ+AICHE JOURNAL+AUG 1996::no title+JACKSON JE+USERS GUIDE PRINCIPA+1980::CHEMOMETRIC METHODS FOR PROCESS MONITORING AND HIGH-PERFORMANCE CONTROLLER-DESIGN+KASPAR, MH; RAY, WH+AICHE JOURNAL+OCT 1992::Improved process understanding using multiway principal component analysis+Kosanovich, KA; Dahl, KS; Piovoso, MJ+INDUSTRIAL &amp; ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH+JAN 1996::Multivariate SPC methods for process and product monitoring+Kourti, T; MacGregor, JF+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 1996::no title+KRESTA J+CAN J CHEM ENG+1991::Application of multivariate statistical process control to batch operations+Lennox, B; Hiden, HG; Montague, GA; et al.+COMPUTERS &amp; CHEMICAL ENGINEERING+JUL 15 2000::PROCESS MONITORING AND DIAGNOSIS BY MULTIBLOCK PLS METHODS+MACGREGOR, JF; JAECKLE, C; KIPARISSIDES, C; et al.+AICHE JOURNAL+MAY 1994::no title+Montgomery, D.

A comparison of prediction variance criteria for response surface designs,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2003,23,8,"Among the numerous design evaluation criteria for response surface designs is the W-criterion that is based on the average prediction variance (APV). In this paper the various APV measures generated by computing packages and their relationships to the IV-criterion are summarized and critiqued. The computer-generated APV criteria require averaging over either a fixed set or a random set of evaluation points. When a fixed set of points is used, the APV measure will be larger than the corresponding IV-criterion value and could lead to the selection of an inferior design based on the IV-criterion. A simple approach that provides exact evaluation of the IV-criterion value for response surface designs on the hypercube is discussed.","average prediction variance,integrated prediction variance",COMPUTER-AIDED-DESIGN,"Borkowski, JJ@Montana State Univ, Dept Math Sci, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA","Borkowski, JJ@Montana State University System@Montana State University@Montana State University Bozeman",not exist,"no title+Atkinson, A.C.; Donev, A.N.+Optimum Experimental Designs+1992::RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE METHODS OF OPTIMUM AND RELATED EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGNS+ATKINSON, AC+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+AUG 1988::no title+*BBN SOFTW PROD CO+RS DISC STAT APP+1989::no title+Box, G.E.P.; Draper, H.R.+Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces+1987::A BASIS FOR THE SELECTION OF A RESPONSE-SURFACE DESIGN+BOX, GEP; DRAPER, NR+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1959::ON THE EXPERIMENTAL ATTAINMENT OF OPTIMUM CONDITIONS+BOX, GEP; WILSON, KB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1951::no title+Davis, P.

Two new mixture models: Living with collinearity but removing its influence,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2003,9,10,"Fitting equations to mixture data collected from highly constrained regions has challenged modelers for the past 35 years. Computer roundoff error, low precision of the estimates, and collinearity among the terms in the models are just a few of the problems encountered. It is well known that, due to collinearity, fitted models can contain coefficient estimates with magnitudes many hundreds or even a thousand times greater that the magnitude of the data values themselves. This can be very problematic to the modeler trying to convince a client the model is adequate. Fitting models in pseudocomponents with and without centering the terms has been one of the strategies used in an effort to reduce the effect of collinearity, but often to no avail. We introduce two additional model forms where the terms are scaled, and we illustrate the benefits of fitting the new models using two numerical examples. The equivalence among models of four different, but related, component systems is shown for the first time.","centered and scaled intercept model,collinearity,constrained mixture region,modifled L-pseudococomponents",,"Cornell, JA@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA::Gorman, JW@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Cornell, JA@University of Florida@State University System of Florida::Gorman, JW@University of Florida@State University System of Florida",not exist,"no title+Cornell, J.

Prediction bounds in accelerated life testing: Weibull models with inverse power relationship,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2003,20,3,"We consider the problem of obtaining lower prediction bounds for a future observation from a Weibull population at design (field use) stress level, using Type II censored accelerated life test data from higher than design stress levels. The scale parameter of the life distribution is assumed to have an inverse power relationship with the stress level. We derive an easily obtainable predictive density for a future observation at the design stress level. The use of the lower percentile points of this predictive density as the lower prediction bounds for a single future observation is investigated using Monte Carlo simulation. Results show that a modified version of the proposed predictive density provides reasonable lower prediction bounds.","censored data,maximum likelihood,prediction bounds,Weibull distribution",EXTREME-VALUE DISTRIBUTION,"Jayawardhana, AA@Pittsburg State Univ, Dept Math, Pittsburg, KS 66762 USA@Univ Missouri, Dept Math & Stat, Rolla, MO 65409 USA::Samaranayake, VA@Pittsburg State Univ, Dept Math, Pittsburg, KS 66762 USA@Univ Missouri, Dept Math & Stat, Rolla, MO 65409 USA","Jayawardhana, AA@Pittsburg State University@University of Missouri System@Missouri University of Science & Technology::Samaranayake, VA@Pittsburg State University@University of Missouri System@Missouri University of Science & Technology","Samaranayake, V A@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1892-8363","no title+ACHCAR JA+REV SOC CHILENA ESTA+1991::no title+Bain, L.

"c-charts, X-charts, and the Katz family of distributions",JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JAN 2003,23,13,"In statistical process control, the primary method used to monitor the number of nonconformities is the c-chart. The conventional c-chart is based on the assumption that the occurrence of nonconformities in samples is well modeled by a Poisson distribution. When the Poisson assumption is not met, the X-chart (individuals chart) is often used as an alternative charting scheme. In this article, we investigate the relative merits of the c-chart compared to the X-chart for the Katz family covering equi-, under-, and over-dispersed distributions relative to the Poisson distribution. The need to use an X-chart rather than a c-chart depends upon whether or not the ratio of the in-control variance to the in-control mean is close to unity. The X-chart, which incorporates the information on this ratio, can lead to significant improvements under certain circumstances. Both 3-sigma c- and X-charts fail to provide reliable information on the status of the process with a small in-control process mean when a downward mean shift occurs. In these cases, charts based on probability limits are much more appropriate.","average run length,maximum likelihood,method of moments,Poisson distribution,robustness,statistical process control","STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,ATTRIBUTES CONTROL CHARTS,FABRICATION","Fang, Y@Univ Oregon, Lundquist Coll Business, Eugene, OR 97403 USA","Fang, Y@University of Oregon@Oregon University System","fang, yue@A-8674-2009","THE IMPACT OF CLUSTERED DEFECT DISTRIBUTIONS IN IC FABRICATION+ALBIN, SL; FRIEDMAN, DJ+MANAGEMENT SCIENCE+SEP 1989::ATTRIBUTE CONTROL CHARTS FOR MARKOV DEPENDENT PRODUCTION PROCESSES+BHAT, UN; LAL, R+IIE TRANSACTIONS+JUN 1990::no title+FANG Y+J STAT PLANNING INFE+2002::SOME CONSIDERATIONS IN THE USE OF QUALITY-CONTROL TECHNIQUES IN INTEGRATED-CIRCUIT FABRICATION+FRIEDMAN, DJ+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+APR 1993::no title+GURLAND J+ENCY STAT SCI+1983::no title+Haight, F.

Operating window experiments: A novel approach to quality improvement,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2002,18,14,"The operating window method is a novel tool in quality engineering. It has been practiced in some industrial sectors but has received scant attention in academic research. If a critical factor for competing failure modes can be identified, the probability of failures can be reduced by widening the operating window of this factor, thus improving the system's quality and reliability. A rigorous foundation is given for some existing practice, particularly the operating window signal-to-noise (SN) ratio. A new strategy is given for design, analysis, and system optimization, which is an improvement over existing practice. We illustrate our approach with the analysis of a wave soldering experiment.","optimization,performance measures,robust parameter design,signal-to-noise ratio,sequential design","PARAMETER DESIGN,PERFORMANCE-MEASURES,SEQUENTIAL DESIGNS","Joseph, VR@Univ Michigan, Dept Stat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA@Univ Michigan, Dept Ind & Operat Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA::Wu, CFJ@Univ Michigan, Dept Stat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA@Univ Michigan, Dept Ind & Operat Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Joseph, VR@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan@University of Michigan@University of Michigan System::Wu, CFJ@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan@University of Michigan@University of Michigan System",not exist,"no title+CLAUSING, D.+Total quality development: a step-by-step guide to word-class concurrent engineering+1994::no title+Fowlkes, W.

Analysis of functional responses from robust design studies,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2002,30,36,Robust design studies with functional responses are becoming increasingly common. The goal in these studies is to analyze location and dispersion effects and optimize performance over a range of input-output values. Taguchi and others have proposed the so-called signal-to-noise ratio analysis for robust design with dynamic characteristics. We consider more general and flexible methods for analyzing location and dispersion effects from such studies and use three real applications to illustrate the methods. Two applications demonstrate the usefulness of functional regression techniques for location and dispersion analysis while the third illustrates a parametric analysis with two-stage modeling. Both a mean-variance analysis for random selection of noise settings as well as a control-by-noise interaction analysis for explicitly controlled noise factors are considered.,"design of experiments,functional data analysis,quality improvement,variation reduction",PARAMETER DESIGN,"Nair, VN@Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA@Oakland Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Rochester, MI 48309 USA@SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Appl Math & Stat, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA::Taam, W@Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA@Oakland Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Rochester, MI 48309 USA@SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Appl Math & Stat, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA::Ye, KQ@Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA@Oakland Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Rochester, MI 48309 USA@SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Appl Math & Stat, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Nair, VN@University of Michigan@University of Michigan System@Oakland University@State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook@State University of New York (SUNY) System::Taam, W@University of Michigan@University of Michigan System@Oakland University@State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook@State University of New York (SUNY) System::Ye, KQ@University of Michigan@University of Michigan System@Oakland University@State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook@State University of New York (SUNY) System",not exist,"Exploiting the inherent structure in robust parameter design experiments+Berube, J; Nair, VN+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 1998::The design and analysis of 2(k-p)xs prototype experiments+Bisgaard, S; Steinberg, DM+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1997::SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIOS, PERFORMANCE CRITERIA, AND TRANSFORMATIONS+BOX, G+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1988::no title+Crowder, M.J.; Hand, D.J.+Analysis of Repeated Measures+1990::no title+Davidian, M.; Giltinan, D.

We show that the robustness property of the PI controller makes it difficult to detect unanticipated mean shifts when the process output is being monitored.

L-k factorial experiments with hard-to-change and easy-to-change factors,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2002,14,18,"Experimental factors, especially when they are hard-to-change, are often not independently reset on each run. For example, it would be very costly to let a mold cool down between runs and then reheat it when the same mold temperature is required on successive runs. Therefore, even when the experiment is run using a random run order, a ""completely randomized design"" requiring a single error term is not obtained. There is a restriction on randomization that causes the experiment to require more than one error term in the model. The analysis of the experiment with restricted randomization often proceeds, however, as if a completely randomized design were run. This ignores the fact that the experiment inherently has a ""split plot"" structure. We examine properties of experiments run in this very common manner and investigate L-k experiments using two error terms. One error term is associated with setting the ""hard-to-change factors"" and the other represents the remaining error. We develop the expected covariance matrices for observations and for the estimated regression coefficients in experiments using a random run order and using run orders that restrict randomization partially or completely. We compare the precision of the estimators of the regression coefficients for the various run order scenarios and show that classical split-plot blocking is superior to a random run order.","blocking,restricted Randomization,split-plot designs","RANDOMIZATION,RESTRICTIONS","Ju, HL@StatPlus Inc, Yardley, PA 19067 USA@JM Lucas & Associates, Wilmington, DE 19808 USA::Lucas, JM@StatPlus Inc, Yardley, PA 19067 USA@JM Lucas & Associates, Wilmington, DE 19808 USA","Ju, HL@Unknow@Unknow::Lucas, JM@Unknow@Unknow",not exist,"no title+ANBARI FT+THESIS DREXEL U+1993::no title+ANBARI RT+ASQC ANN QUAL C T+1994::no title+Anderson, V.

Trend-resistant and cost-efficient block designs with fixed or random block effects,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2002,26,9,"When performing an experiment in a time sequence, the experimenter may have reason to believe that the observed responses will be influenced by a temporal trend over the course of the experiment. This paper presents an algorithm for the construction of blocked designs that are optimally balanced for time trends. Cost considerations are allowed for in the construction process. Cost-efficient and trend-resistant run orders are constructed for regression designs in the presence of either fixed or random block effects. The proposed algorithm is intended to provide the experimenter with a general method for solving a wide range of important problems. Examples clarify practical utility, and show that the computed trend-resistant run orders have outstanding performance in terms of both cost and D-optimality.","design of experiments,random effects,trends","RESPONSE-SURFACE DESIGNS,OPTIMAL REGRESSION DESIGNS,LINEAR TRENDS,RUN ORDERS,CONSTRUCTION,FACTORIAL","Tack, L@Catholic Univ Louvain, Dept Appl Econ, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium::Vandebroek, M@Catholic Univ Louvain, Dept Appl Econ, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium","Tack, L@Universite Catholique Louvain::Vandebroek, M@Universite Catholique Louvain","Vandebroek, Martina@J-9103-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0317-1986","no title+ANDERSON, R.L.; BANCROFT, T.A.+Statistical theory in research+1952::no title+ATKINS J+THESIS U CALIFORNIA+1994::Optimal regression designs in the presence of random block effects+Atkins, JE; Cheng, CS+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+MAR 1 1999::THE CONSTRUCTION OF EXACT D-OPTIMUM EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGNS WITH APPLICATION TO BLOCKING RESPONSE-SURFACE DESIGNS+ATKINSON, AC; DONEV, AN+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1989::Experimental designs optimally balanced for trend+Atkinson, AC; Donev, AN+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1996::The design and analysis of 2(k-p)xs prototype experiments+Bisgaard, S; Steinberg, DM+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1997::TREND-FREE BLOCK-DESIGNS - THEORY+BRADLEY, RA; YEH, CM+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1980::ON THE YEH-BRADLEY CONJECTURE ON LINEAR TREND-FREE BLOCK-DESIGNS+CHAI, FS; MAJUMDAR, D+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1993::no title+CHASALOW S+THESIS U CALIFORNIA+1992::OPTIMAL REGRESSION DESIGNS UNDER RANDOM BLOCK-EFFECTS MODELS+CHENG, CS+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 1995::COMPUTER-AIDED BLOCKING OF FACTORIAL AND RESPONSE-SURFACE DESIGNS+COOK, RD; NACHTSHEIM, CJ+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 1989::MINIMUM COST TREND-FREE RUN ORDERS OF FRACTIONAL FACTORIAL-DESIGNS+COSTER, DC; CHENG, CS+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+SEP 1988::FACTOR CHANGES AND LINEAR TRENDS IN 8-RUN 2-LEVEL FACTORIAL DESIGNS+DRAPER, NR; STONEMAN, DM+TECHNOMETRICS+1968::D-optimal response surface designs in the presence of random block effects+Goos, P; Vandebroek, M+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+OCT 28 2001::Linear trend-free Box-Behnken designs+Hinkelmann, K; Jo, J+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+SEP 1 1998::On the determination and construction of E-optimal block designs in the presence of linear trends+Jacroux, M+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+APR 1 1998::On the determination and construction of optimal block designs in the presence of linear trends+Jacroux, M; Majumdar, D; Shah, KR+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1997::no title+JACROUX M+STAT DESIGN ANAL IND+1990::EFFICIENT BLOCK-DESIGNS IN THE PRESENCE OF TRENDS+JACROUX, M; MAJUMDAR, D; SHAH, KR+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 1995::DESIGNING EXPERIMENTS WHEN RUN ORDER IS IMPORTANT+JOINER, BL; CAMPBELL, C+TECHNOMETRICS+1976::TREND-FREE BLOCK-DESIGNS FOR VARIETAL AND FACTORIAL-EXPERIMENTS+LIN, ML; DEAN, AM+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+SEP 1991::On finding trend-free block designs+Lin, WC; Stufken, J+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+MAY 1 1999::no title+Searle, S.

On the performance of geometric charts with estimated control limits,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,OCT 2002,25,62,"The control chart based on the geometric distribution (geometric chart) has been shown to be competitive with p- or np-charts for monitoring the proportion nonconforming, especially for applications in high quality manufacturing environments. However, implementing a geometric chart is often based on the assumption that the in-control proportion nonconforming is known or accurately estimated. For a high quality process, an accurate parameter estimate may require a very large sample size that is seldom available, In this paper we investigate the sample size effect when the proportion nonconforming is estimated. An analytical approximation is derived to compute shift detection probabilities and run length distributions. It is found that the effect on the alarm probability can be significant even with sample sizes as large as 10,000. However, the average run length is only affected mildly unless the sample size is small and there is a large process improvement. In practice, the quantitative results of the paper can be used to determine the minimum number of items required for estimating the control limits of a geometric chart so that certain average run length requirements are met.","average run length,false alarm probability,sample size,statistical process control","SYNTHETIC CONTROL CHART,(X)OVER-BAR","Yang, ZL@Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ & Social Studies, Singapore 259756, Singapore@Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Singapore 117543, Singapore@Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Ind & Syst Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA::Xie, M@Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ & Social Studies, Singapore 259756, Singapore@Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Singapore 117543, Singapore@Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Ind & Syst Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA::Kuralmani, V@Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ & Social Studies, Singapore 259756, Singapore@Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Singapore 117543, Singapore@Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Ind & Syst Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA::Tsui, KL@Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ & Social Studies, Singapore 259756, Singapore@Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Singapore 117543, Singapore@Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Ind & Syst Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Yang, ZL@Singapore Management University@National University of Singapore@Georgia Institute of Technology@University System of Georgia::Xie, M@Singapore Management University@National University of Singapore@Georgia Institute of Technology@University System of Georgia::Kuralmani, V@Singapore Management University@National University of Singapore@Georgia Institute of Technology@University System of Georgia::Tsui, KL@Singapore Management University@National University of Singapore@Georgia Institute of Technology@University System of Georgia","YANG, Zhenlin@D-1453-2009@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3390-1329::Xie, Min@A-5552-2011@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8500-8364::TSUI, Kwok Leung@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0558-2279","MODELING DISCRETE DATA IN SPC - THE G-CHART AND H-CHART+BENNEYAN, JC; KAMINSKY, FC+ASQC 48TH ANNUAL QUALITY CONGRESS PROCEEDINGS+1994::no title+BENNEYAN JC+IN PRESS HLTH CARE M+2001::Mathematical modeling of impingement drying of corn tortillas+Braud, LM; Moreira, RG; Castell-Perez, ME+JOURNAL OF FOOD ENGINEERING+NOV 2001::The run length distributions of the R, s and s(2) control charts when sigma is estimated+Chen, GM+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+JUN 1998::The mean and standard deviation of the run length distribution of (X)over-bar charts when control limits are estimated+Chen, GM+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 1997::no title+Chung, K.L.+A Course in Probability Theory+1974::ONLINE G-CONTROL CHART FOR ATTRIBUTE DATA+GLUSHKOVSKY, EA+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+MAY-JUN 1994::no title+GOH TN+TOTAL QUAL MANAGE+1994::X and R Chart Control Limits Based on a Small Number of Subgroups+Hiller, F.

We argue that the performance is most sensitive to departures from multivariate normality with individual observations (subgroups of size one). We show that with individual observations, and therefore, by extension, with subgroups of any size, the MEWMA chart can be designed to be robust to non-normality and very effective at detecting process shifts of any size or direction, even for highly skewed and extremely heavy-tailed multivariate distributions.","average run length,exponentially weighted moving average,multivariate control charts,multivariate gamma distribution,multivariate t distribution,statistical process control,unbiased average run length","ECONOMIC STATISTICAL DESIGNS,AVERAGE CONTROL CHART,NONNORMALITY","Stoumbos, ZG@Rutgers State Univ, Dept Management Sci & Informat Syst, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA@Mississippi State Univ, Coll Business & Ind, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA::Sullivan, JH@Rutgers State Univ, Dept Management Sci & Informat Syst, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA@Mississippi State Univ, Coll Business & Ind, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA","Stoumbos, ZG@Rutgers State University New Brunswick@Mississippi State University::Sullivan, JH@Rutgers State University New Brunswick@Mississippi State University",not exist,"Multivariate Process Control+Alt, F.B; Smith, N.D.+HDB STAT+1988::no title+Anderson, T.+An Introdiction to Multivariate Statistical Analysis+1984::Robustness of the EWMA control chart to non-normality+Borror, CM; Montgomery, DC; Runger, GC+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1999::A discussion on statistically-based process monitoring and control.+Box, GEP; Coleman, DE; Faltin, FW; et al.+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 1997::no title+Fang, K-T; Zhang, Y-T.+Generalized multivariate analysis.

The statistical design of EWMA control charts with estimated parameters,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2002,23,75,"The existing procedures for designing exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control charts are based on the assumption of known process parameters. In practice, these parameters are usually unknown and replaced with estimates from an in-control reference sample. Using parameter estimates with design procedures intended for known parameters can lead to significantly deteriorated chart performance. In this paper, the assumption of known parameters is relaxed and design procedures for the EWMA chart are developed accordingly.","average run length,exponentially weighted moving average,integral equation","MOVING AVERAGE CHARTS,INDIVIDUAL OBSERVATIONS,CONTROL SCHEMES,CONTROL LIMITS,RUN-LENGTH,VARIANCE","Jones, LA@Univ Miami, Dept Management Sci, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA","Jones, LA@University of Miami",not exist,"Multivariate Process Control+Alt, F.B; Smith, N.D.+HDB STAT+1988::EWMA control charts for the smallest and largest observations+Amin, RW; Wolff, H; Besenfelder, W; et al.+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+APR 1999::Robustness of the EWMA control chart to non-normality+Borror, CM; Montgomery, DC; Runger, GC+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1999::MODELING AND ANALYSIS OF EWMA CONTROL SCHEMES WITH VARIANCE-ADJUSTED CONTROL LIMITS+CHANDRASEKARAN, S; ENGLISH, JR; DISNEY, RL+IIE TRANSACTIONS+JUN 1995::A comparison of two phase I control charts+Chou, S.; Champ, C.

Extensions to confidence region calculations for the path of steepest ascent,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2002,15,5,"The method of steepest ascent plays an important role in response surface methodology by giving a direction for further experimentation after an initial factorial design. To determine whether the path of steepest ascent has been determined precisely enough, the fraction of all possible directions that are included in the confidence 'cone' around the fitted path of steepest ascent can be calculated. In this paper, extensions to the existing method are made to cover heterogeneous error variances, nonorthogonal designs and generalized linear models. We also propose a design criterion for augmenting a given experimental design in problems for which the path of steepest ascent has not been determined precisely enough.","augmenting design,generalized least squares,response surface methodology",DESIGNED EXPERIMENTS,"Sztendur, EM@Victoria Univ Technol, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia::Diamond, NT@Victoria Univ Technol, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia","Sztendur, EM@Victoria University::Diamond, NT@Victoria University",not exist,"no title+ANKENMAN B+COMMUNICATION+1995::Analysis of Factorial Experiments with Defects or Defectives as the Response+Bisgaard, S.; Fuller, H.T.+Quality Engineering+1994::no title+Box, G.E.P.; Draper, H.R.+Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces+1987::Contribution to the discussion, symposium on interval estimation+Box, G.

Augmenting Scheffe linear mixture models with squared and/or crossproduct terms,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2002,17,16,"In a mixture experiment, q greater than or equal to 2 components are mixed in various proportions, and one or more responses are measured for each mixture. Scheffe quadratic models are often used to model responses as functions of the component proportions. A complete Scheffe quadratic model contains q linear terms beta(i)x(i) and Q = q(q - 1)/2 quadratic crossproduct terms beta(ij)x(i)x(j) (i < j). Because Q increases rapidly as q increases, alternative models containing fewer quadratic terms than the complete Scheffe quadratic model are of interest. Traditionally, reduced Scheffe quadratic models, formed by augmenting linear terms with selected quadratic crossproduct terms, are used. We propose generating partial quadratic mixture (PQM) 2 models by augmenting linear terms with selected quadratic crossproduct terms and/or squared terms beta(ii)x(i)(2) The interpretations and potential advantages of PQM models compared to equivalent restricted Scheffe quadratic models and to reduced Scheffe quadratic models are discussed. The methods are illustrated using data from two constrained mixture experiments involving simulated waste glass.","curvature,mixture component effects,model reduction,variable selection","DESIGNS,GLASSES","Piepel, GF@Pacific NW Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99352 USA@Univ Kentucky, Dept Stat, Lexington, KY 40506 USA@Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada::Szychowski, JM@Pacific NW Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99352 USA@Univ Kentucky, Dept Stat, Lexington, KY 40506 USA@Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada::Loeppky, JL@Pacific NW Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99352 USA@Univ Kentucky, Dept Stat, Lexington, KY 40506 USA@Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada","Piepel, GF@Pacific Northwest National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)@University of Kentucky@Simon Fraser University::Szychowski, JM@Pacific Northwest National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)@University of Kentucky@Simon Fraser University::Loeppky, JL@Pacific Northwest National Laboratory@United States Department of Energy (DOE)@University of Kentucky@Simon Fraser University",not exist,"D-optimal axial designs for quadratic and cubic additive mixture models+Chan, LY; Meng, JH; Jiang, YC; et al.+AUSTRALIAN &amp; NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+SEP 1998::A-optimal designs for an additive quadratic mixture model+Chan, LY; Guan, YN; Zhang, CQ+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 1998::no title+Cornell, J.A.+Experiments with mixtures: designs, models, and the analysis of mixture data+1990::NOTE ON POLYNOMIAL RESPONSE FUNCTIONS FOR MIXTURES+COX, DR+BIOMETRIKA+1971::ADDITIVITY AND INTERACTION IN 3-COMPONENT EXPERIMENTS WITH MIXTURES+DARROCH, JN; WALLER, J+BIOMETRIKA+1985::no title+DRAPER NR+APPL REGRESSION ANAL+1998::no title+HARE LB+EXPT IND DESIGN ANAL+1985::no title+Lewis, G.A.; Mathieu, D.; Phan-Tan-Luu, R.+Pharmaceutical Experimental Design+1999::Liquidus temperature of spinel precipitating high-level waste glasses+Mika, M; Schweiger, MJ; Vienna, JD; et al.+SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR NUCLEAR WASTE MANAGEMENT XX+1997::no title+MILLER AJ+SUBSET SELECTION REG+1990::no title+MONTGOMERY, D.

Transfer function modeling of processes with dynamic inputs,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2002,27,8,"Time series structures, which are common occurrences with data in many industrial processes, complicate a quality practitioner's efforts to accurately position control chart limits. ARIMA modeling and a variety of control charting methods have been recommended for monitoring process data with a time series structure. Estimates of ARIMA model parameters may not be reliable, however, if assignable causes of variation are present in the process data used to fit the time series model. Control limits may also be misplaced if the process inputs are dynamic and exhibiting a time series structure. Our purpose in this paper is to explore the ability of a transfer function model to identify assignable causes of variation and to model dynamic relationships between process inputs and outputs. A transfer function model is developed to monitor biochemical oxygen demand output from a wastewater treatment process, a process with dynamic inputs. This model is used to identify periods of disturbance to the wastewater process and to capture the relationship between the variable nature of the input to the process and the resulting output. Simulation results are included in this study to measure the sensitivity of transfer function models and to highlight conditions where transfer function modeling is critical.","autocorrelation,statistical process control,time series analysis","STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,TIME-SERIES,AUTOCORRELATED PROCESSES,JOINT ESTIMATION,CHARTS,PARAMETERS,OUTLIERS","West, D@E Carolina Univ, Dept Decis Sci, Greenville, NC 27858 USA@Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Management Sci & Stat, Kingston, RI 02881 USA::Dellana, S@E Carolina Univ, Dept Decis Sci, Greenville, NC 27858 USA@Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Management Sci & Stat, Kingston, RI 02881 USA","West, D@East Carolina University@University of North Carolina@University of Rhode Island::Dellana, S@East Carolina University@University of North Carolina@University of Rhode Island","Dellana, Scott@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6715-2282","no title+Alwan, L.

An EWMA-based bounded adjustment scheme with adaptive noise variance estimation,JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY,NO DOI,JUL 2002,27,5,Bounded-adjustment schemes have been developed to adjust processes subject to stochastic disturbances for the purpose of minimizing a criterion that includes adjustment costs. These schemes were generally formulated under the assumption that the standard deviation of the inherent white-noise component of the disturbances was known. This paper presents a method for applying a bounded-adjustment scheme to continuous or short-run processes in which the standard deviation of the white noise is unknown or is subject to change. We show through Monte Carlo simulation that this control method may be applied to both nonstationary and stationary processes.,"exponentially weighted moving average,feedback control,statistical process control","STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,ENGINEERING PROCESS-CONTROL,FEEDBACK ADJUSTMENT,COMBINING SPC","O'Shaughnessy, PT@Univ Iowa, Coll Publ Hlth, Iowa City, IA 52245 USA@Univ Iowa, Coll Engn, Iowa City, IA 52245 USA@Univ Vermont, Stat Program, Burlington, VT 05401 USA","O'Shaughnessy, PT@University of Iowa@University of Iowa@University of Vermont",not exist,"no title+Astrom, K.

Such designs are particularly attractive when the experimental region of interest is spherical rather than a hypercube. It is also noted that the k treatment combinations in each simplex design coincide with the axial points in the second-order, asymmetric composite designs proposed by Box and Wilson (1951) and later discussed by Lucas (1974).
