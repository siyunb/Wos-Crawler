Exploratory analysis of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) for quantitative traits,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2005,3,10,"With the decreasing cost and the increasing ability to quickly genotype single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) across the human genome, large databases containing possibly hundreds of typed SNPs are becoming common in population-based studies of quantitative traits. Testing for association between individual SNPs and the quantitative trait is an important first step in the discovery of disease susceptibility SNPs. This task, however, could be time-consuming and tedious if a large number of SNPs is involved. In this article, I introduce two new commands designed to facilitate the screening and testing of multiple SNPs for possible association with quantitative traits.","st0083,hwsnp,qtlsnp,genetic epidemiology,genetic linkage,QTL,biallelic marker,single nucleotide polymorphisms,Hardy-Weinberg",,"Cleves, MA@UAMS, Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Little Rock, AR 72211 USA","Cleves, MA@University of Arkansas System@University of Arkansas Little Rock",not exist,"Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium tett and allele frequency estimation+Cleves, M.+Stata Tech.

Stata in space: Econometric analysis of spatially explicit raster data,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2005,6,2,"Realizing the importance of location, economists are increasingly adopting spatial analytical and spatial econometric perspectives to study questions such as the geographical targeting of policy interventions, regional agglomeration effects, the diffusion of technologies across space, or causes and consequences of land-cover change. Explicitly accounting for location in econometric estimations can be of great benefit for researchers working at the interface of economics or environmental sciences and geography.

The objective of this article is to demonstrate how spatially explicit raster data derived from standard geographical information system (GIS) software can be used within Stata. Three programs implemented as ado-files are presented. These import geographic raster data into Stata (ras2dta), draw systematic spatial samples within Stata (spatsam), and export data and estimation results in a form usable by standard GIS software (dta2ras). A numerical example is presented to estimate the determinants of forest cover with a spatially explicit logit model, calculate predicted probabilities, and map the predictions with GIS software.","dm0014,ras2dta,spatsam,dta2ras,geographical information systems (CIS),raster data,spatial modeling,spatial econometrics",,"Muller, D@Humboldt Univ, Inst Agr Econ & Social Sci, D-1086 Berlin, Germany","Muller, D@Humboldt University of Berlin","Mueller, Daniel@A-4454-2009@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8988-0718","Spatial Econometrics+ANSELIN, L.+A Companion to Theoretical Econometrics+2001::no title+Anselin,, L.+Spatial econometrics: methods and models+1988::no title+*ESRI+ARCVIEW 3 2 ONL HELP+2000::no title+MULLER D+THESIS GEORGAUGUST U+2003::Deforestation and land use change: sparse data environments+Nelson, GC; Geoghegan, J+AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS+NOV 2002::Cellular geography+Tobler, W.+Philosophy in Geography+1979"

QIC program and model selection in GEE analyses,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2007,16,125,"The generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach is a widely used statistical method in the analysis of longitudinal data in clinical and epidemiological studies. It is an extension of the generalized linear model (GLM) method to correlated data such that valid standard errors of the parameter estimates can be drawn. Unlike the GLM method, which is based on the maximum likelihood theory for independent observations, the GEE method is based on the quasilikelihood theory and no assumption is made about the distribution of response observations. Therefore. Akaike's information criterion, a widely used method for model selection in GLM; is not applicable to GEE directly. However, Pan (Biometrics 2001; 57: 120-125) proposed a model-selection method for GEE and termed it quasilikelihood under the independence model criterion. This criterion can also be used to select the best-working correlation structure. From Pan's methods, I developed a general Stata program, qic, that accommodates all the distribution and link functions and correlation structures available in Stata version 9. In this paper, I introduce this program and demonstrate how to use it to select the best working correlation structure and the best subset of covariates through two examples in longitudinal studies.","st0126,qic,Akaike's information criterion,GEE,likelihood,model,quasilikelihood under the independence model criterion","GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,SEGREGATION ANALYSES,CANCER","Cui, James@Monash Univ, Dept Epidemiol & Prevent Med, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia","Cui, James@Monash University",not exist,"NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::no title+no author+National Longitudinal Survey of Labor Market Experience+1989::Segregation analyses of 1,476 population-based Australian families affected by prostate cancer+Cui, JS; Staples, MP; Hopper, JL; et al.+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS+MAY 2001::After BRCA1 and BRCA2-what next?

Devices for working with spells in Stata include marking the start of each spell with indicator variables and tagging spells with integer codes. Panel data are easy to handle with the by: prefix. Some kinds of spell identification require two passes through the data; as when only spells of some minimum length are of interest or short gaps are tolerable within spells. Many questions concerning spells are easy to answer given careful use of by: and appropriate sort order, selection of just 1 observation from each panel or spell; and appreciation of the many functions written for egen.

Robust standard errors for panel regressions with cross-sectional dependence,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2007,34,385,"I present a new Stata program, xtscc, that estimates pooled ordinary least-squares/weighted least-squares regression and fixed-effects (within) regression models with Driscoll and Kraay (Review of Economics and Statistics 80: 549-560) standard errors. By running Monte Carlo simulations, I compare the finite-sample properties of the cross-sectional dependence-consistent Driscoll-Kraay estimator with the properties of other, more commonly used covariance matrix estimators that do not account for cross-sectional dependence. The results indicate that Driscoll-Kraay standard errors are well calibrated when cross-sectional dependence is present.

Estimating parameters of dichotomous and ordinal item response models with gllamm,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2007,25,37,"Item response theory models are measurement models for categorical responses. Traditionally, the models are used in educational testing, where responses to test items can be viewed as indirect measures of latent ability. The test items are scored either dichotomously (correct-incorrect) or by using an ordinal scale (a grade from poor to excellent). Item response models also apply equally for measurement of other latent traits. Here we describe the one- and two-parameter logit models for dichotomous items, the partial-credit and rating scale models for ordinal items, and an extension of these models where the latent variable is regressed on explanatory variables. We show how these models can be expressed as generalized linear latent and mixed models and fitted by using the user-written command gllamm.","st0129,gllamm,gllapred,latent variables,Rasch model,partial-credit model,rating scale model,latent regression,generalized linear latent and mixed model,adaptive quadrature,item response theory",RASCH MODEL,"Zheng, Xiaohui@Univ Calif Berkeley, Quantitat Methods & Evaluat Program, Grad Sch Educ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA@Univ Calif Berkeley, Grad Grp Biostat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA@Univ London, Inst Educ, Chair Social Stat, London WC1E 7HU, England::Rabe-Hesketh, Sophia@Univ Calif Berkeley, Quantitat Methods & Evaluat Program, Grad Sch Educ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA@Univ Calif Berkeley, Grad Grp Biostat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA@Univ London, Inst Educ, Chair Social Stat, London WC1E 7HU, England","Zheng, Xiaohui@University of California System@University of California Berkeley@University of California System@University of California Berkeley@University College London@University of London::Rabe-Hesketh, Sophia@University of California System@University of California Berkeley@University of California System@University of California Berkeley@University College London@University of London","Rabe-Hesketh, Sophia@B-1643-2008@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5257-4837","no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical Data Analysis+2002::RATING FORMULATION FOR ORDERED RESPONSE CATEGORIES+ANDRICH, D+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1978::no title+De Boeck, P.; Wilson, M.+Explanatory item response models: A generalized linear and nonlinear approach+2004::no title+Embreston, S.

Modeling of the cure fraction in survival studies,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2007,15,37,"Cure models are a special type of survival analysis model where it is assumed that there are a proportion of subjects who will never experience the event and thus the survival curve will eventually reach a plateau. In population-based cancer studies, cure is said to occur when the mortality (hazard) rate in the diseased group of individuals returns to the same level as that expected in the general population. The cure fraction is of interest to patients and a useful measure to monitor trends and differences in survival of curable disease. I will describe the strsmix and strsnmix commands, which fit the two main types of cure fraction model, namely, the mixture and nonmixture cure fraction models. These models allow incorporation of the expected background mortality rate and thus enable the modeling of relative survival when cure is a possibility.

Speaking stata: Turning over a new leaf,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2007,17,1,"Stem-and-leaf displays have been widely taught since John W. Tukey publicized them energetically in the 1970s. They remain useful for many distributions of small or modest size, especially for showing fine structure such as digit preference. Stata's implementation stem produces typed text displays and has some inevitable limitations, especially for comparison of two or more displays. One can re-create stem-and-leaf displays with a few basic Stata commands as scatterplots of stem variable versus position on line with leaves shown as marker labels. Comparison of displays then becomes easy and natural using scatter, by(). Back-to-back presentation of paired displays is also possible. I discuss variants on standard stem-and-leaf displays in which each distinct value is a stem, each distinct value is its own leaf, or axes are swapped. The problem shows how one can, with a few lines of Stata, often produce standard graph forms from first principles, allowing in turn new variants.

A generic function evaluator implemented in Mata,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2007,3,0,"Background: When implementing new statistical procedures, there is often a need for simple-and yet computationally efficient-ways of numerically evaluating composite distribution functions. If the statistical procedure must support calculations for censored and noncensored cases, those calculations should be carried out using efficient computational implementations of both definite and indefinite integrals (e.g., calculation of tail areas of distribution functions).

Method: We developed a generic function evaluator such that users may specify a function using reverse Polish notation. As its argument the function evaluator takes a matrix of pointers and then applies the rows of this matrix to its internally defined stack of pointers. Accordingly, each row of the argument matrix defines a single operation such as evaluating a function on the current element of the stack, applying an algebraic operation to the two top elements of the stack, or manipulating the stack itself. Defining new composite distribution functions from other (atomic) distribution functions then corresponds to joining two or more function-defining matrices vertically. This approach can further be used to obtain integrals of any defined function. As an example we show how the density and distribution function for the minimum of two Weibull distributed random variables can be numerically evaluated and integrated.

Results: The procedure provides a flexible and extensible framework for implementing numerical evaluation of general, composite distributions. The procedure is numerically relatively efficient, although not optimal.","pr0034,rpnfcn(),RPN,Mata",,"Stovring, Henrik@Univ So Denmark, Res Unit Gen Pract, Odense, Denmark","Stovring, Henrik@University of Southern Denmark","Stovring, Henrik@I-4683-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5821-2351","no title+DeGroot,, M.

"Speaking Stata: Counting groups, especially panels",STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2007,6,1,"Counting panels, and more generally groups, is sometimes possible in Stata through a reduction command (e.g., collapse, contract, statsby) that produces a smaller dataset or through a tabulation command. Yet there are also many problems, especially with irregular sets of observations for varying times, that do not yield easily to this approach. This column focuses on techniques for answering such questions while maintaining the same data structure. Especially useful are the Stata commands by: and egen and indicator variables constructed for the purpose. With by: we often exploit the fact that subscripts are defined within group, not within dataset. egen functions are often used to produce group-level statistics. Tagging each group just once ensures that summaries, including counts, are of groups, not individual observations.","dm0033,data management,panels",,"Cox, Nicholas J.@Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham, England","Cox, Nicholas J.@Durham University",not exist,"Speaking Stata: How to move step by: step+Cox, N.

The article's emphasis is on using xtmixed to estimate variance components. Prior to Stata 9, loneway could be used to estimate variance components for one-way random-effects models. For other experimental designs, variance components could be computed manually using saved results after anova. The latter approach is viable but requires tedious computations for complicated experimental designs. Instead, as of Stata 9, variance components are easily obtained by using xtmixed.","st0095,variance components,experimental design,ANOVA,REML,ML,multilevel,random coefficients,mixed models",,"Marchenko, Yulia@Statacorp, College Stn, TX USA","Marchenko, Yulia@Unknow",not exist,"no title+Goldstein, H.+Multilevel Statistical Models+2003::MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION FOR MIXED ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE MODEL+HARTLEY, HO; RAO, JNK+BIOMETRIKA+1967::ESTIMATION OF VARIANCE AND COVARIANCE COMPONENTS+HENDERSON, CR+BIOMETRICS+1953::no title+Kuehl, R.+Design of experiments: statistical principles of research design and analysis+2000::no title+Rabe-Hesketh, S.

Generalized ordered logit/partial proportional odds models for ordinal dependent variables,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2006,8,629,"This article describes the gologit2 program for generalized ordered logit models. gologit2 is inspired by Vincent Fu's gologit routine (Stata Technical Bulletin Reprints 8: 160-164) and is backward compatible with it but offers several additional powerful options. A major strength of gologit2 is that it can fit three special cases of the generalized model: the proportional odds/parallel-lines model, the partial proportional odds model, and the logistic regression model. Hence, gologit2 can fit models that are less restrictive than the parallel-lines models fitted by ologit (whose assumptions are often violated) but more parsimonious and interpretable than those fitted by a nonordinal method, such as multinomial logistic regression (i.e., mlogit). Other key advantages of gologit2 include support for linear constraints, survey data estimation, and the computation of estimated probabilities via the predict command.","st0097,gologit2,gologit,logistic regression,ordinal regression,proportional odds,partial proportional odds,generalized ordered logit model,parallellines model",,"Williams, Richard@Univ Notre Dame, Dept Sociol, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA","Williams, Richard@University of Notre Dame",not exist,"no title+Clogg, CC; Shihadeh, ES.+Statistical Models for Ordinal Variables+1994::Estimating generalized ordered logit models+Fu, VK.+Stata Technical Bulletin+1998::A review of ordinal regression models applied on health-related quality of life assessments+Lall, R; Campbell, MJ; Walters, SJ; et al.+STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH+FEB 2002::no title+Long, JS; Freese, J.+Regression Models for Categorical Dependent Variables Using Stata+2006::no title+Norusis, M.

The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we describe the technical implementation of the estimation routine and discuss its properties. Further, we compare our estimation routine with the Stata program gllamm, which solves integration by using Gauss-Hermite quadrature or adaptive quadrature. For the analysis, we draw on multilevel data about schooling. Our empirical findings show that the estimation techniques lead to approximately the same estimation. results. The advantage of simulation over Gauss-Hermite quadrature is a marked reduction in computational time for integrals with higher dimensions. Adaptive quadrature leads to more stable results relative to the other integration methods. However, simulation is more time efficient. We find that maximum simulated likelihood leads to estimation results with reasonable accuracy in roughly half the time required when using adaptive quadrature.","st0104,multinomial logit model,multinomial logistic model,panel data,unobserved heterogeneity,maximum simulated likelihood,Halton sequences",,"Haan, Peter@DIW Berlin, D-14195 Berlin, Germany::Uhlendorff, Arne@DIW Berlin, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Haan, Peter@DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung::Uhlendorff, Arne@DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung","Uhlendorff, Arne@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2823-4445","Quasi-random maximum simulated likelihood estimation of the mixed multinomial logit model+Bhat, CR+TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL+AUG 2001::no title+Cameron, A.; Trivedi, P.+Microeconometrics: Methods and Applications+2005::no title+CAPPELLARI L+STATA J+2006::Software update: st0045_1: Multivariate probit regression' using simulated maximum likelihood+Cappellari, L.+Stata Journal+2005::Multivariate probit regression using simulated maximum likelihood+Cappellari, L.; Jenkins, S.

"Maximum likelihood estimation of endogenous switching and sample selection models for binary, ordinal, and count variables",STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2006,22,81,"Studying behavior in economics, sociology, and statistics often involves fitting models in which the response variable depends on a dummy variable-also known as a regime-switch variable-or in which the response variable is observed only if a particular selection condition is met. In either case, standard regression techniques deliver inconsistent estimators if unobserved factors that affect the response are correlated with unobserved factors that affect the switching or selection variable. Consistent estimators can be obtained by maximum likelihood estimation of a joint model of the outcome and switching or selection variable. This article describes a ""wrapper"" program, ssm, that calls gllarim (Rabe-Hesketh, Skrondal, and Pickles, GLLAMM Manual [University of California-Berkeley, Division of Biostatistics, Working Paper Series, Paper No. 160]) to fit such models. The wrapper accepts data in a simple structure, has a straightforward syntax, and reports output that is easily interpretable. One important feature of ssm is that the log likelihood can be evaluated using adaptive quadrature (Rabe-Hesketh, Skrondal, and Pickles, Stata Journal 2: 1-21; Journal of Econometrics 128: 301-323).","st0107,endogenous switching,sample selection,binary variable,count data,ordinal variable,probit,Poisson regression,adaptive quadrature,gllamm,wrapper,ssm",BIAS,"Miranda, Alfonso@Keele Univ, Sch Econ & Management Studies, Keele, Staffs, England@Univ Calif Berkeley, Grad Sch Educ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA@Univ London, Inst Educ, London WC1N 1AZ, England::Rabe-Hesketh, Sophia@Keele Univ, Sch Econ & Management Studies, Keele, Staffs, England@Univ Calif Berkeley, Grad Sch Educ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA@Univ London, Inst Educ, London WC1N 1AZ, England","Miranda, Alfonso@Keele University@University of California Berkeley@University of California System@University College London@University of London::Rabe-Hesketh, Sophia@Keele University@University of California Berkeley@University of California System@University College London@University of London","Rabe-Hesketh, Sophia@B-1643-2008@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5257-4837","ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE LIKELIHOOD RATIO+CHERNOFF, H+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1954::The Demand for Deductibles in Private Health Insurance: A Probit Model with Sample Selection+De Ven, Wynand P.

Confidence intervals for rank statistics: Somers' D and extensions,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2006,31,119,"Somers' D is an asymmetric measure of association between two variables, which plays a central role as a parameter behind rank or nonparametric statistical methods. Given predictor variable X and outcome variable Y, we may estimate D-YX as a measure of the effect of X on Y, or we may estimate D-XY as a performance indicator of X as a predictor of Y. The somersd package allows the estimation of Somers' D and Kendall's tau(a) with confidence limits as well as p-values. The Stata 9 version of somersd can estimate extended versions of Somers' D not previously available, including the Gini index, the parameter tested by the sign test, and extensions to left- or right-censored data. It can also estimate stratified versions of Somers' D, restricted to pairs in the same stratum. Therefore, it is possible to define strata by grouping values of a confounder, or of a propensity score based on multiple confounders, and to estimate versions of Somers' D that measure the association between the outcome and the predictor, adjusted for the confounders. The Stata 9 version of somersd uses the Mata language for improved computational efficiency with large datasets.","snp15-6,somersd,Somers' D,Kendall's tau(a),Harrell's c,Roe area,Gini index,population-attributable risk,rank correlation,rank-sum test,Wilcoxon test,sign test,confidence intervals,nonparametric methods,propensity score","PROPENSITY SCORE,SAMPLES,ASSOCIATION","Newson, Roger@Univ London Imperial Coll Sci & Technol, London, England","Newson, Roger@Imperial College London",not exist,"JACKKNIFING U-STATISTICS+ARVESEN, JN+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1969::GENERALIZED KRUSKAL-WALLIS TEST FOR COMPARING K SAMPLES SUBJECT TO UNEQUAL PATTERNS OF CENSORSHIP+BRESLOW, N+BIOMETRIKA+1970::no title+Cowell, Frank A.+Measuring Inequality+1995::THE SIGNIFICANCE OF RANK CORRELATIONS WHERE PARENTAL CORRELATION EXISTS+DANIELS, HE; KENDALL, MG+BIOMETRIKA+1947::A CONFIDENCE-INTERVAL FOR PR(X-LESS-THAN-Y)-PR(X-GREATER-THAN-Y) ESTIMATED FROM SIMPLE CLUSTER SAMPLES+EDWARDES, MDD+BIOMETRICS+JUN 1995::On the probable error of a coefficient of correlation deduced from a small sample+Fisher, RA.+Metron+1921::THE FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION OF THE PRODUCT-MOMENT CORRELATION COEFFICIENT IN RANDOM SAMPLES OF ANY SIZE DRAWN FROM NON-NORMAL UNIVERSES+GAYEN, AK+BIOMETRIKA+1951::A GENERALIZED WILCOXON TEST FOR COMPARING ARBITRARILY SINGLY-CENSORED SAMPLES+GEHAN, EA+BIOMETRIKA+1965::MEASURES OF ASSOCIATION FOR CROSS CLASSIFICATIONS .2.

Practical fixed-effects estimation methods for the three-way error-components model,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2006,9,47,"Methods for fixed-effects estimation of the three-way error-components model are not yet standard.

We also show how these methods can be implemented in Stata. There is a caveat, however.

"Confidence intervals for rank statistics: Percentile slopes, differences, and ratios",STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2006,32,22,"I present a program, censlope, for calculating confidence intervals for generalized Theil-Sen median (and other percentile) slopes (and per-unit ratios) of Y with respect to X. The confidence intervals are robust to the possibility that the conditional population distributions of Y, given different values of X, differ in ways other than location, such as having unequal variances. censlope uses the program somersd and is part of the somersd package. censlope can therefore estimate confounder-adjusted percentile slopes, limited to comparisons within strata defined by values of confounders, or by values of a propensity score representing multiple confounders. Iterative numerical methods have been implemented in the Mata language, enabling efficient calculation of percentile slopes and their confidence limits in large samples.

Visualizing main effects and interactions for binary logit models,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2005,5,22,"This paper considers the role of covariates when using predicted probabilities to interpret main effects and interactions in logit models. While predicted probabilities are very intuitive for interpreting main effects and interactions, the pattern of results depends on the contribution of covariates. We introduce a concept called the covariate contribution, which reflects the aggregate contribution of all of the remaining predictors (covariates) in the model and a family of tools to help visualize the relationship between predictors and the predicted probabilities across a variety of covariate contributions. We believe this strategy and the accompanying tools can help researchers who wish to use predicted probabilities as an interpretive framework for logit models acquire and present a more comprehensive interpretation of their results. These visualization tools could be extended to other models (such as binary probit, multinomial logistic, ordinal logistic models, and other nonlinear models).","st0081,logistic regression,predicted probabilities,main effects,interactions,covariate contribution",,"Mitchell, MN@Univ Calif Los Angeles, Acad Technol Serv, Stat Consulting Grp, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA::Chen, X@Univ Calif Los Angeles, Acad Technol Serv, Stat Consulting Grp, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA","Mitchell, MN@University of California Los Angeles@University of California System::Chen, X@University of California Los Angeles@University of California System",not exist,"no title+Aiken, L.

Tabulation of multiple responses,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2005,7,23,"Although multiple-response questions are quite common in survey research, Stata's official release does not provide much capability for an effective analysis of multiple-response variables. For example, in a study on drug addiction an interview question might be, ""Which substances did you consume during the last four weeks?"" The respondents just list all the drugs they took, if any; e.g., an answer could be ""cannabis, cocaine, heroin"" or ""ecstasy, cannabis"" or ""none"", etc. Usually, the responses to such questions are stored as a set of variables and, therefore, cannot be easily tabulated. I will address this issue here and present a new module to compute one- and two-way tables of multiple responses. The module supports several types of data structure, provides significance tests, and offers various options to control the computation and display of the results. In addition, tools to create graphs of multiple-response distributions are presented.","st0082,mrtab,mrgraph,_mrsvmat,multiple responses,multiple testing,tabulate",,"Jann, B@ETH, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Sociol, Zurich, Switzerland@Univ Bern, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland","Jann, B@ETH Zurich@University of Bern","Jann, Ben@A-5655-2008","no title+BRAUN N+ILLEGALE MARKTE HERO+2001::THE COMPARISON OF PERCENTAGES IN MATCHED SAMPLES+COCHRAN, WG+BIOMETRIKA+1950::Speaking Stata: Graphing categorical and compositional data+Cox, N.

In this article, I present the Maxima Bridge System, which is a collection of software programs that allows Stata to interface with Maxima so that Maxima can be used for symbolic computation to transfer data from Stata to Maxima and to retrieve results from Maxima. The cooperation between Stata and Maxima provides an environment for statistical analysis in which symbolic computation can be easily used together with all the facilities supplied by Stata. In this environment, symbolic computation algorithms can be used to manage the complexity of algebra and calculus, whereas numerical computation can be used when speed matters.

"Time-efficient algorithms for robust estimators of location, scale, symmetry, and tail heaviness",STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2015,15,1,"The analysis of the empirical distribution of univariate data often includes the computation of location, scale, skewness, and tail-heaviness measures, which are estimates of specific parameters of the underlying population distribution. Several measures are available, but they differ by Gaussian efficiency, robustness regarding outliers, and meaning in the case of asymmetric distributions. In this article, we briefly compare, for each type of parameter (location, scale, skewness, and tail heaviness), the ""classical"" estimator based on (centered) moments of the empirical distribution, an estimator based on specific quantiles of the distribution, and an estimator based on pairwise comparisons of the observations. This last one always performs better than the other estimators, particularly in terms of robustness, but it requires a heavy computation time of an order of n(2). Fortunately, as explained in Croux and Rousseeuw (1992, Computational Statistics 1: 411-428), the algorithm of Johnson and Mizoguchi (1978, SIAM Journal of Scientific Computing 7: 147-153) allows one to substantially reduce the computation time to an order of n log n and, hence, allows the use of robust estimators based on pairwise comparisons, even in very large datasets. This has motivated us to program this algorithm for Stata. In this article, we describe the algorithm and the associated commands. We also illustrate the computation of these robust estimators by involving them in a normality test of Jarque-Bera form (Jarque and Bera 1980, Economics Letters 6: 255-259; Brys, Hubert, and Struyf, 2008, Computational Statistics 23: 429-442) using real data.","st0370,mhl,sqn,medcouple,robjb,location,scale,symmetry,tail heaviness,mean,median,skewness,kurtosis,robust estimation","TESTS,SKEWNESS,NORMALITY","Gelade, Wouter@Univ Namur, CRED, Namur, Belgium::Verardi, Vincenzo@Univ Namur, CRED, Namur, Belgium@Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, Brussels, Belgium@iCite, Brussels, Belgium::Vermandele, Catherine@Univ Libre Bruxelles, LMTD, Brussels, Belgium","Gelade, Wouter@University of Namur::Verardi, Vincenzo@Universite Libre de Bruxelles@University of Namur::Vermandele, Catherine@Universite Libre de Bruxelles",not exist,"Robust measures of tail weight+Brys, G; Hubert, M; Struyf, A+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+FEB 10 2006::A robust measure of skewness+Brys, G; Hubert, M; Struyf, A+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+DEC 2004::Goodness-of-fit tests based on a robust measure of skewness+Brys, Guy; Hubert, Mia; Struyf, Anja+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS+JUL 2008::Time- efficient algorithms for two highly robust estimators of scale+Croux, C.; Rousseeuw, P.

Generating univariate and multivariate nonnormal data,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2015,5,0,"Because the assumption of normality is common in statistics, the robustness of statistical procedures to the violation of the normality assumption is often of interest. When one examines the impact of the violation of the normality assumption, it is important to simulate data from a nonnormal distribution with varying degrees of skewness and kurtosis. Fleishman (1978, Psychometrika 43: 521-532) developed a method to simulate data from a univariate distribution with specific values for the skewness and kurtosis. Vale and Maurelli (1983, Psychometrika 48: 465-471) extended Fleishman's method to simulate data from a multivariate nonnormal distribution.

Bayesian optimal interval design for phase I oncology clinical trials,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2015,7,0,"The Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design is a novel phase I trial design for finding the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). With the BOIN design, phase I trials are conducted as a sequence of decision-making steps for assigning an appropriate dose for each enrolled patient. The design optimizes the assignment of doses to patients by minimizing incorrect decisions of dose escalation or deescalation; that is, it decreases the chance of erroneously escalating or de-escalating the dose when the current dose is higher or lower than the MTD. This feature of the BOIN design strongly ensures adherence to ethical standards. The most prominent advantage of the BOIN design is that it simultaneously achieves design simplicity and superior performance in comparison with similar methods. The BOIN design can be implemented in a simple way that is similar to the 3 3 design, but it yields substantially better operating characteristics. Compared with the well-known continual reassessment method, the BOIN design yields average performance when selecting the MTD, but it has a substantially lower risk of assigning patients to subtherapeutic or overly toxic doses. In this article, we present a command (optinterval) for implementing the BOIN design in a phase I clinical trial setting.","st0372,optinterval,Bayesian optimal interval,phase I clinical trial design,maximum tolerated dose,operating characteristic",,"Fellman, Bryan M.@Univ Texas Houston, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA::Yuan, Ying@Univ Texas Houston, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Fellman, Bryan M.@UTMD Anderson Cancer Center@University of Texas System@University of Texas Health Science Center Houston::Yuan, Ying@UTMD Anderson Cancer Center@University of Texas System@University of Texas Health Science Center Houston",not exist,"A random walk rule for phase I clinical trials+Durham, SD; Flournoy, N; Rosenberger, WF+BIOMETRICS+JUN 1997::Isotonic designs for phase I trials+Leung, DHY; Wang, YG+CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS+APR 2001::Bayesian optimal interval designs for phase I clinical trials+Liu, Suyu; Yuan, Ying+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+APR 2015::CONTINUAL REASSESSMENT METHOD - A PRACTICAL DESIGN FOR PHASE-1 CLINICAL-TRIALS IN CANCER+OQUIGLEY, J; PEPE, M; FISHER, L+BIOMETRICS+MAR 1990::Accelerated titration designs for phase I clinical trials in oncology+Simon, R; Freidlin, B; Rubinstein, L; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE+AUG 6 1997::Design and analysis of phase I clinical trials+Storer, B.

Fixed-effect panel threshold model using Stata,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2015,14,4,"Threshold models are widely used in macroeconomics and financial analysis for their simple and obvious economic implications. With these models, however, estimation and inference is complicated by the existence of nuisance parameters.

In this article, I introduce a new command (xthreg) for implementing this model. I also use Monte Carlo simulations to show that, although the size distortion of the threshold-effect test is small, the coverage rate of the confidence interval estimator is unsatisfactory.

Frailty models and frailty-mixture models for recurrent event times,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2015,30,3,"The analysis of recurrent event times faces three challenges: between-subject heterogeneity (frailty), within-subject event dependence, and the possibility of a cured fraction. Frailty can be handled by including a latent random-effects term in a Cox-type model. Event dependence may be considered as contributing to the intervention effect, or it may be considered as a source of nuisance, depending on the analysts' specific research questions. If it is seen as a nuisance, the analysis can stratify the recurrent event times according to event order. If it is seen as contributing to the intervention effect, stratification should not be used. Models with and without stratification for event order estimate two types of treatment effects. They are analogous to per-protocol analysis and intention-to-treat analysis, respectively. In the context of chronic disease treatment, we want to estimate whether there is a cured fraction; for infectious disease prevention, this is called a nonsusceptible fraction. In infectious disease prevention, we want to understand whether an intervention protects each of its recipients to some extent (""leaky"" model) or whether it totally protects some recipients but offers no protection to the rest (""all-or-none"" model).

newspell: Easy management of complex spell data,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2015,5,5,"Biographical data gathered in surveys are often stored in spell format, allowing for overlaps between spell states. On the one hand, these kind of data provide useful information for researchers. On the other hand, the data structure is often complex and not easy to handle. The newspell program offers a solution to the problem of spell-data management with three important features. First, it can rank spells and cut off overlaps according to the rank order. Second, newspell can combine overlapping parts of spells into new categories of spells, generating entirely new states. Third, it can detect gaps in the spell data that are not yet coded. It also includes subcommands for the management of complex spell data. Spell states can be merged and filled in with information from adjacent spells, and the data can be transformed to long or wide format. The command can be used to clean data, to combine two spell-data sources that have information on different kinds of states, or to deal with spell data that are complex by survey design. newspell is useful for users who are not familiar with complex spell data and have little experience in Stata programming or data management. For experienced users, newspell saves a lot of time and coding work.","dm0078,newspell,spell data,data management,complex data",,"Kroeger, Hannes@European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy","Kroeger, Hannes@European University Institute","Kroger, Hannes@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1576-5519","no title+Cleves, M.+FAQ: How do I convert my spell-type data into a survival dataset?+1999::spell: Stata module for identification of spells or runs of similar values+Cox, N.

Estimating net survival using a life-table approach,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2015,21,4,"Cancer registries are often interested in estimating net survival (NS), the probability of survival if the cancer under study is the only possible cause of death. Pohar Perme, Stare, and Esteve (2012, Biometrics 68: 113-120) proposed a new estimator of NS based on inverse probability weighting. They demonstrated that existing estimators of NS based on relative survival were biased, whereas the new estimator was unbiased. The new estimator was developed for continuous survival times, yet cancer registries often have only discrete survival times (for example, survival time in completed months or years). Therefore, we propose an approach to estimation for when survival times are discrete. In this article, we describe the stnet command for life-table estimation of NS, adapting the Pohar Perme estimation approach to life-table estimation. Estimates can be made using a period or hybrid approach in addition to the traditional cohort (or complete) approach, and age-standardized survival estimates are available.","st0375,stnet,net survival,relative survival,competing risks,life table,cancer survival,age standardization,period analysis","CANCER-PATIENT SURVIVAL,RELATIVE SURVIVAL,ALTERNATIVE APPROACH,POPULATION,RATIOS,RATES","Coviello, Enzo@ASL BT, Barletta, Italy::Dickman, Paul W.@Karolinska Inst, Stockholm, Sweden::Seppa, Karri@Finnish Canc Registry, FIN-00170 Helsinki, Finland::Pokhrel, Arun@Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada","Coviello, Enzo@Unknow::Dickman, Paul W.@Karolinska Institutet::Seppa, Karri@Finnish Cancer Registry::Pokhrel, Arun@University of Alberta","Dickman, Paul@B-4572-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5788-3380","An alternative approach to monitoring cancer patient survival+Brenner, H; Gefeller, O+CANCER+NOV 1 1996::Hybrid analysis for up-to-date long-term survival rates in cancer registries with delayed recording of incident cases+Brenner, H; Rachet, B+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER+NOV 2004::An alternative approach to age adjustment of cancer survival rates+Brenner, H; Arndt, V; Gefeller, O; et al.+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER+OCT 2004::Cancer survival in five continents: a worldwide population-based study (CONCORD)+Coleman, Michel P.; Quaresma, Manuela; Berrino, Franco; et al.+LANCET ONCOLOGY+AUG 2008::no title+Coleman, MP; Babb, P; Damiecki, P<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Grosclaude, P; Honjo, S; Jones, J</span>.+Cancer survival trends in England and Wales 1971-1995: deprivation and NHS region+1999::Standard cancer patient population for age standardising survival ratios+Corazziari, I; Quinn, M; Capocaccia, R+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER+OCT 2004::Estimating net survival: the importance of allowing for informative censoring+Danieli, Coraline; Remontet, Laurent; Bossard, Nadine; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+APR 13 2012::Interpreting trends in cancer patient survival+Dickman, P.

Estimating and modeling relative survival,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2015,40,31,"When estimating patient survival using data collected by population-based cancer registries, it is common to estimate net survival in a relative-survival framework. Net survival can be estimated using the relative-survival ratio, which is the ratio of the observed survival of the patients (where all deaths are considered events) to the expected survival of a comparable group from the general population. In this article, we describe a command, strs, for life-table estimation of relative survival. We discuss three methods for estimating expected survival, as well as the cohort, period, and hybrid approaches for estimating relative survival. We also implement a life-table version of the Pohar Perme (2012, Biometrics 68: 113-120) estimator of net survival, and we describe two methods for age standardization. We also explain how, in addition to net probabilities of death, crude probabilities of death due to cancer and due to other causes can be estimated using the method of Cronin and Feuer (2000, Statistics in Medicine 19: 1729-1740). We conclude this article with discussion and examples of modeling excess mortality using various approaches, including the full-likelihood approach (using the ml command) and Poisson regression (using the gin command with a user-specified link function).","st0376,strs,excess mortality,relative survival,survival analysis,Poisson regression,life table,cancer survival,period analysis","CANCER-PATIENT SURVIVAL,ALTERNATIVE APPROACH,REGRESSION-MODELS,AGE ADJUSTMENT,BREAST-CANCER,NET SURVIVAL,RATES,RATIOS","Dickman, Paul W.@Karolinska Inst, Stockholm, Sweden::Coviello, Enzo@ASL BT, Barletta, Italy","Dickman, Paul W.@Karolinska Institutet::Coviello, Enzo@Unknow","Dickman, Paul@B-4572-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5788-3380","The Calculation of Survival Rates+Berkson, J.+Carcinoma and Other Malignant Lesions of the Stomach+1942::Age adjustment of cancer survival rates: methods, point estimates and standard errors+Brenner, H; Hakulinen, T+BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER+AUG 8 2005::An alternative approach to monitoring cancer patient survival+Brenner, H; Gefeller, O+CANCER+NOV 1 1996::Hybrid analysis for up-to-date long-term survival rates in cancer registries with delayed recording of incident cases+Brenner, H; Rachet, B+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER+NOV 2004::An alternative approach to age adjustment of cancer survival rates+Brenner, H; Arndt, V; Gefeller, O; et al.+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER+OCT 2004::Are patients diagnosed with breast cancer before age 50 years ever cured?+Brenner, H; Hakulinen, T+JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY+FEB 1 2004::Up-to-date cancer survival: Period analysis and beyond+Brenner, Hermann; Hakulinen, Timo+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER+MAR 15 2009::no title+Breslow, N; Day, N.+Statistical methods ancer research, vol 2.

Access to such confidential data is usually restricted, and the microlevel data cannot be brought together to a single platform for cross-country analysis. To solve this confidentiality problem while also maintaining a high level of harmonization of the key economic concepts, dynemp can be distributed in a network of researchers who have access to the national confidential microdata.

Tools for checking calibration of a Cox model in external validation: Prediction of population-averaged survival curves based on risk groups,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2015,10,15,"Royston (2014, Stata Journal 14: 738-755) explained how a popular application of the Cox proportional hazards model ""is to develop a multivariable prediction model, often a prognostic model to predict the future clinical outcome of patients with a particular disorder from 'baseline' factors measured at some initial time point. For such a model to be useful in practice, it must be 'validated'; that is, it must perform satisfactorily in an external sample of patients independent of the one on which the model was originally developed. One key aspect of performance is calibration, which is the accuracy of prediction, particularly of survival (or equivalently, failure or event) probabilities at any time after the time origin"". In this article, I suggest an approach to assess calibration by comparing observed (Kaplan-Meier) and predicted survival probabilities in several prognostic groups derived by placing cutpoints on the prognostic index. I distinguish between full validation, where all relevant quantities are estimated on the derivation dataset and predicted on the validation dataset, and partial validation, where the prognostic index and prognostic groups are derived from published information and the baseline distribution function is estimated in the validation dataset. Partial validation is more feasible in practice because it is uncommon to have access to individual patient values in both datasets. I exemplify the method by detailed analysis of two datasets in the disease primary biliary cirrhosis; the datasets comprise a derivation and a validation dataset. I describe a new ado-file, stcoxgrp, that performs the necessary calculations. Results for stcoxgrp are displayed graphically, which makes it easier for users to picture calibration (or lack thereof) according to follow-up time.","st0380,stcoxgrp,Cox proportional hazards model,multivariable model,prognostic factors,prognostic groups,external validation,calibration,survival probabilities",,"Royston, Patrick@UCL, MRC Clin Trials Unit, London, England","Royston, Patrick@University of London@Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit@University College London",not exist,"BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF AZATHIOPRINE AND PREDICTION OF PROGNOSIS IN PRIMARY BILIARY-CIRRHOSIS - FINAL RESULTS OF AN INTERNATIONAL TRIAL+CHRISTENSEN, E; NEUBERGER, J; CROWE, J; et al.+GASTROENTEROLOGY+1985::no title+Fleming, T.

Plotting regression coefficients and other estimates,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2014,18,25,"Graphical display of regression results has become increasingly popular in presentations and in scientific literature because graphs are often much easier to read than tables. Such plots can be produced in Stata by the marginsplot command (see [R] marginsplot). However, while marginsplot is versatile and flexible, it has two major limitations: it can only process results left behind by margins (see [R] margins), and it can handle only one set of results at a time. In this article, I introduce a new command called coefplot that overcomes these limitations. It plots results from any estimation command and combines results from several models into one graph. The default behavior of coefplot is to plot markers for coefficients and horizontal spikes for confidence intervals. However, coef plot can also produce other types of graphs. I illustrate the capabilities of coefplot by using a series of examples.","gr0059,coefplot,marginsplot,margins,regression plot,coefficients plot,ropeladder plot","TABLES,PERCEPTION,GRAPHS","Jann, Ben@Univ Bern, Bern, Switzerland","Jann, Ben@University of Bern","Jann, Ben@A-5655-2008","no title+Chambers, JM; Cleveland, WS; Tukey, PA.+Graphical methods for data analysis+1983::THE STATISTICAL DEFINITION OF A SOCIETAL VARIABLE+Chapin, F.

femlogit-Implementation of the multinomial logit model with fixed effects,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2014,18,10,"Fixed-effects models have become increasingly popular in social-science research. The possibility to control for unobserved heterogeneity makes these models a prime tool for causal analysis. Fixed-effects models have been derived and implemented for many statistical software packages for continuous, dichotomous, and count-data dependent variables. Chamberlain (1980, Review of Economic Studies 47: 225-238) derived the multinomial logistic regression with fixed effects. However, this model has not yet been implemented in any statistical software package. Possible applications would be analyses of effects on employment status, with special consideration of part-time or irregular employment, and analyses of effects on voting behavior that implicitly control for long-time party identification rather than measuring it directly. This article introduces an implementation of this model with the new command femlogit.

Analysis of partially observed clustered data using generalized estimating equations and multiple imputation,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2014,34,9,"Clustered data arise in many settings, particularly within the social and biomedical sciences. For example, multiple-source reports are commonly collected in child and adolescent psychiatric epidemiologic studies where researchers use various informants (for instance, parents and adolescents) to provide a holistic view of a subject's symptoms. Fitzmaurice et al. (1995, American Journal of Epidemiology 142: 1194-1203) have described estimation of multiple-source models using a standard generalized estimating equation (GEE) framework. However, these studies often have missing data because additional stages of consent and assent are required. The usual GEE is unbiased when data are missing completely at random in the context of Little and Rubin (2002, Statistical Analysis with Missing Data [Wiley]). This is a strong assumption that may not be tenable. Other options, such as the weighted GEE, are computationally challenging when missingness is nonmonotone. Multiple imputation is an attractive method to fit incomplete data models while requiring only the less restrictive missing-at-random assumption. Previously, estimation of partially observed clustered data was computationally challenging. However, recent developments in Stata have facilitated using them in practice. We demonstrate how to use multiple imputation in conjunction with a GEE to investigate the prevalence of eating disorder symptoms in adolescents as reported by parents and adolescents and to determine the factors associated with concordance and prevalence. The methods are motivated by the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and their Children, a cohort study that enrolled more than 14,000 pregnant mothers in 1991-92 and has followed the health and development of their children at regular intervals. While point estimates for the missing-at-random model were fairly similar to those for the GEE under missing completely at random, the missing-at-random model had smaller standard errors and required less stringent assumptions regarding missingness.","st0363,ALSPAC study,eating disorders,multiple informants,weighted estimating equations,generalized estimating equations,multiple imputation,missing data,missing at random,missing completely at random","LONGITUDINAL DATA-ANALYSIS,MISSING DATA,REGRESSION-ANALYSIS,INFORMANTS,MODELS,PSYCHOPATHOLOGY,SIMULATION,DISORDERS,IMPACT,CHILD","Aloisio, Kathryn M.@Smith Coll, Northampton, MA 01063 USA::Micali, Nadia@UCL, London, England::Swanson, Sonja A.@Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Boston, MA 02115 USA::Field, Alison@Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Boston, MA 02115 USA::Horton, Nicholas J.@Amherst Coll, Amherst, MA 01002 USA","Aloisio, Kathryn M.@Smith College::Micali, Nadia@University College London@University of London::Swanson, Sonja A.@Harvard University::Field, Alison@Harvard University::Horton, Nicholas J.@Unknow",not exist,"A simulation study comparing weighted estimating equations with multiple imputation based estimating equations for longitudinal binary data+Beunckens, Caroline; Sotto, Cristina; Molenberghs, Geert+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JAN 1 2008::Doubly Robust and Multiple-Imputation-Based Generalized Estimating Equations+Birhanu, Teshome; Molenberghs, Geert; Sotto, Cristina; et al.+JOURNAL OF BIOPHARMACEUTICAL STATISTICS+2011::Cohort Profile: The 'Children of the 90s'-the index offspring of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children+Boyd, Andy; Golding, Jean; Macleod, John; et al.+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+FEB 2013::What can go wrong when you assume that correlated data are independent: an illustration from the evaluation of a childhood health intervention in Brazil+Cannon, MJ; Warner, L; Taddei, JA; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+MAY 15 2001::The impact of different sources of body mass index assessment on smoking onset: An application of multiple-source information models+Caria, Maria Paola; Bellocco, Rino; Galanti, Maria Rosaria; et al.+STATA JOURNAL+2011::A comparison of inclusive and restrictive strategies in modern missing data procedures+Collins, LM; Schafer, JL; Kam, CM+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+DEC 2001::AN OVERVIEW OF PRACTICAL APPROACHES FOR HANDLING MISSING DATA IN CLINICAL TRIALS+DeSouza, Cynthia M.; Legedza, Anna T.

Lee (2009, Review of Economic Studies, 76: 1071-1102) proposes an estimator for treatment-effect bounds that limit the possible range of the treatment effect. In this approach, the lower and upper bound correspond to extreme assumptions about the missing information that are consistent with the observed data. In contrast to conventional parametric approaches to correcting for sample-selection bias, Lee's bounds estimator rests on very few assumptions.

General-to-specific modeling in Stata,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2014,22,2,"Empirical researchers are frequently confronted with issues regarding which explanatory variables to include in their models. This article describes the application of a well-known model-selection algorithm to Stata: general-to-specific (GETS) modeling. This process provides a prescriptive and defendable way of. selecting a few relevant variables from a large list of potentially important variables when fitting a regression model. Several empirical issues in GETS modeling are then discussed, specifically, how such an algorithm can be applied to estimations based upon cross-sectional, time-series, and panel data. A command is presented, written in Stata and Mata, that implements this algorithm for various data types in a flexible way. This command is based on Stata's regress or xtreg command, so it is suitable for researchers in the broad range of fields where regression analysis is used. Finally, the genspec command is illustrated using data from applied studies of GETS modeling with Monte Carlo simulation. It is shown to perform as empirically predicted and to have good size and power (or gauge and potency) properties under simulation.","st0365,genspec,model selection,general to specific,statistical analysis,specification tests","HETEROSCEDASTICITY,ECONOMETRICS,REGRESSIONS,SELECTION,BASEMENT,TESTS","Clarke, Damian@Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford, England","Clarke, Damian@University of Oxford",not exist,"SIMPLE TEST FOR HETEROSCEDASTICITY AND RANDOM COEFFICIENT VARIATION+BREUSCH, TS; PAGAN, AR+ECONOMETRICA+1979::THE LAGRANGE MULTIPLIER TEST AND ITS APPLICATIONS TO MODEL-SPECIFICATION IN ECONOMETRICS+BREUSCH, TS; PAGAN, AR+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+1980::Mortality density forecasts: An analysis of six stochastic mortality models+Cairns, Andrew J.

Nettleton (2009, Journal of the American Statistical Association 104: 1052-1059) developed a likelihood-ratio test for testing whether a particular category was most probable, showed that the test was an example of an intersection-union test, and proposed other intersection-union tests for testing whether a particular category was most probable. He extended his likelihood-ratio test to the existence of a unique most probable category and showed that his test was equivalent to the test developed by Berry (2001, Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference 99: 175-182). Nettleton (2009, Journal of the American Statistical Association 104: 1052-1059) showed that the likelihood ratio for identifying a unique most probable cell could be viewed as a union-intersection test.

treatrew: A user-written command for estimating average treatment effects by reweighting on the propensity score,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2014,16,6,"Reweighting is a popular statistical technique to deal with inference in the presence of a nonrandom sample, and various reweighting estimators have been proposed in the literature. This article presents the user-written command treatrew, which implements reweighting on the propensity-score estimator as proposed by Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983, Biometrika 70: 41-55) in their seminal article. The main contribution of this command lies in providing analytical standard errors for the average treatment effects in the whole population, in the subpopulation of the treated, and in that of the untreated. Standard errors are calculated using the approximation suggested by Wooldridge (2010, 920-930, Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data [MIT Press]), but bootstrapped standard errors can also be easily computed. Because an implementation of this estimator with analytic standard errors and nonnormalized weights is missing in Stata, this article and the accompanying ado-file aim to provide the community with an easy-to-use method for reweighting on the propensity-score.

A Stata package for the application of semiparametric estimators of dose-response functions,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2014,26,6,"In many observational studies, the treatment may not be binary or categorical but rather continuous, so the focus is on estimating a continuous dose- response function. In this article, we propose a set of programs that semiparametrically estimate the dose response function of a continuous treatment under the unconfoundedness assumption. We focus on kernel methods and penalized spline models and use generalized propensity-score methods under continuous treatment regimes for covariate adjustment.

The bmte command: Methods for the estimation of treatment effects when exclusion restrictions are unavailable,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2014,15,3,"We present a new Stata command, bate (bias-minimizing treatment effects), that implements two new estimators proposed in Millimet and Tchernis (2013, Journal of Applied Econometrics 28: 982-1017) and designed to estimate the effect of treatment when selection on unobserved variables exists and appropriate exclusion restrictions are unavailable. In addition, the bate command estimates treatment effects from several alternative estimators that also do not rely on exclusion restrictions for identification of the causal effects of the treatment, including the following: 1) Heckman's two-step estimator (1976, Annals of Economic and Social Measurement 5: 475-492; 1979, Econometrica 47: 153-161); 2) a control function approach outlined in Heckman, LaLonde, and Smith (1999, Handbook of Labor Economics 3: 1865-2097) and Navarro (2008, The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics [Palgrave Macmillan]); and 3) a more recent estimator proposed by Klein and Vella (2009, Journal of Applied Econometrics 24: 735-762) that exploits heteroskedasticity for identification. By implementing two new estimators alongside preexisting estimators, the bate command provides a picture of the average causal effects of the treatment across a variety of assumptions.

Density-based empirical likelihood procedures for testing symmetry of data distributions and K-sample comparisons,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2014,21,1,"In practice, parametric likelihood-ratio techniques are powerful statistical tools. In this article, we propose and examine novel and simple distribution-free test statistics that efficiently approximate parametric likelihood ratios to analyze and compare distributions of K groups of observations. Using the density-based empirical likelihood methodology, we develop a Stata package that applies to a test for symmetry of data distributions and compares K-sample distributions. Recognizing that recent statistical software packages do not sufficiently address K-sample nonparametric comparisons of data distributions, we propose a new Stata command, vxdbel, to execute exact density-based empirical likelihood-ratio tests using K samples. To calculate p-values of the proposed tests, we use the following methods: 1) a classical technique based on Monte Carlo p-value evaluations; 2) an interpolation technique based on tabulated critical values; and 3) a new hybrid technique that combines methods 1 and 2. The third, cutting-edge method is shown to be very efficient in the context of exact-test p-value computations. This Bayesian-type method considers tabulated critical values as prior information and Monte Carlo generations of test statistic values as data used to depict the likelihood function. In this case, a nonparametric Bayesian method is proposed to compute critical values of exact tests.","st0338,vxdbel,empirical likelihood,likelihood ratio,nonparametric tests,exact tests,K-sample comparisons,symmetry,p-value computation","ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER,SEVERE MOOD DYSREGULATION,PAIRED DATA,BAYES FACTORS,RATIO TESTS,INFERENCE","Vexler, Albert@SUNY Buffalo, Dept Biostat, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA::Tanajian, Hovig@SUNY Buffalo, Dept Biostat, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA::Hutson, Alan D.@SUNY Buffalo, Dept Biostat, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA","Vexler, Albert@State University of New York (SUNY) System@State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo::Tanajian, Hovig@State University of New York (SUNY) System@State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo::Hutson, Alan D.@State University of New York (SUNY) System@State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo",not exist,"Local maximum likelihood estimation and inference+Fan, JQ; Farmen, M; Gijbels, I+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1998::no title+Gibbons, J.

A smooth covariate rank transformation for use in regression models with a sigmoid dose-response function,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2014,7,2,"We consider how to represent sigmoid-type regression relationships in a practical and parsimonious way. A pure sigmoid relationship has an asymptote at both ends of the range of a continuous covariate. Curves with a single asymptote are also important in practice. Many smoothers, such as fractional polynomials and restricted cubic regression splines, cannot accurately represent doubly asymptotic curves. Such smoothers may struggle even with singly asymptotic curves. Our approach to modeling sigmoid relationships involves applying a preliminary scaled rank transformation to compress the tails of the observed distribution of a continuous covariate. We include a step that provides a smooth approximation to the empirical cumulative distribution function of the covariate via the scaled ranks. The procedure defines the approximate cumulative distribution transformation of the covariate. To fit the substantive model, we apply fractional polynomial regression to the outcome with the smoothed, scaled ranks as the covariate. When the resulting fractional polynomial function is monotone, we have a sigmoid function. We demonstrate several practical applications of the approximate cumulative distribution transformation while also illustrating its ability to model some unusual functional forms. We describe a command, acd, that implements it.","st0339,acd,continuous covariate,sigmoid function,fractional polynomials,regression models",,"Royston, Patrick@MRC Clin Trials Unit, London, England@UCL, London, England","Royston, Patrick@University College London@University of London@Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit",not exist,"Prognostic model for survival for people diagnosed with invasive cutaneous melanoma+Baade, P.; Royston, P.; Youl, P.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Weinstock, M.; Geller, A.; Aitken, J</span>.+GLOB CONTR ADV SKIN+2013::Interferon alfa-2a versus combination therapy with interferon alfa-2a, interleukin-2, and fluorouracil in patients with untreated metastatic renal cell carcinoma (MRC RE04/EORTC GU 30012): an open-label randomised trial+Gore, Martin E.; Griffin, Clare L.; Hancock, Barry; et al.+LANCET+FEB 20 2010::Further development of flexible parametric models for survival analysis+Lambert, Paul C.; Royston, Patrick+STATA JOURNAL+2009::no title+Royston,, P.; Lambert,, P.C.+Flexible Parametric Survival Analysis Using Stata: Beyond the Cox Model+2011::no title+Royston, P; Sauerbrei, W.+Multivariable model-building: A pragmatic approach to regression analysis based on fractional polynomials for modelling continuous variables+2008::Multivariable modeling with cubic regression splines: A principled approach+Royston, Patrick; Sauerbrei, Willi+STATA JOURNAL+2007::no title+SASIENI P+STAT J+2005"

Application of multiple imputation using the two-fold fully conditional specification algorithm in longitudinal clinical data,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2014,12,18,"Electronic health records of longitudinal clinical data are a valuable resource for health care research. One obstacle of using databases of health records in epidemiological analyses is that general practitioners mainly record data if they are clinically relevant. We can use existing methods to handle missing data, such as multiple imputation (MI), if we treat the unavailability of measurements as a missing-data problem. Most software implementations of MI do not take account of the longitudinal and dynamic structure of the data and are difficult to implement in large databases with millions of individuals and long follow-up. Nevalainen, Kenward, and Virtanen (2009, Statistics in Medicine 28: 3657-3669) proposed the two-fold fully conditional specification algorithm to impute missing data in longitudinal data. It imputes missing values at a given time point, conditional on information at the same time point and immediately adjacent time points. In this article, we describe a new command, twofold, that implements the two-fold fully conditional specification algorithm. It is extended to accommodate MI of longitudinal clinical records in large databases.","st0345,twofold,multiple imputation,longitudinal data",,"Welch, Catherine@UCL, London, England::Bartlett, Jonathan@London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1, England::Petersen, Irene@UCL, London, England","Welch, Catherine@University College London@University of London::Bartlett, Jonathan@University of London@London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine::Petersen, Irene@University College London@University of London",not exist,"no title+Bartlett, J.

miivfind: A command for identifying model-implied instrumental variables for structural equation models in Stata,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2014,27,1,"This article presents a new Stata command, miivfind, that implements an algorithm developed by Bollen and Bauer (2004, Sociological Methods and Research 32: 425-452) to find the model-implied instrumental variables (MIIVs) from an identified structural equation model. MIIVs allow researchers to draw on instrumental-variable estimators, such as two-stage least-squares estimators, to obtain estimates for the parameters of a hypothesized structural equation model. It can be difficult to identify MIIVs by inspection of either a diagram of the model or the model equations. Two examples are provided that illustrate the use of miivfind to identify MIIVs and some of the advantages of a MIIV estimator as compared with a maximum likelihood estimator. By assisting in the process of finding MIIVs, miivfind facilitates the use of an alternative class of estimators, instrumental-variable estimators, to the standard maximum-likelihood and asymptotic-distribution free estimators available for structural equation models.","st0324,miivfind,structural equation models,instrumental-variable estimators,model-implied instrumental variables","LEAST-SQUARES 2SLS,ESTIMATOR,SPECIFICATION,TESTS","Bauldry, Shawn@Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Sociol, Birmingham, AL 35233 USA","Bauldry, Shawn@University of Alabama System@University of Alabama Birmingham",not exist,"The colonial origins of comparative development: An empirical investigation+Acemoglu, D; Johnson, S; Robinson, JA+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+DEC 2001::Mostly Harmless Econometrics: An Empiricists Companion+Angrist, JD; Pischke, JS+MOSTLY HARMLESS ECONOMETRICS: AN EMPIRICISTS COMPANION+2009::no title+Anselin,, L.+Spatial econometrics: methods and models+1988::SOME TESTS OF SPECIFICATION FOR PANEL DATA - MONTE-CARLO EVIDENCE AND AN APPLICATION TO EMPLOYMENT EQUATIONS+ARELLANO, M; BOND, S+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+APR 1991::ON FINITE-SAMPLE DISTRIBUTIONS OF GENERALIZED CLASSICAL LINEAR IDENTIFIABILITY TEST STATISTICS+BASMANN, RL+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1960::Two-stage least squares and latent variable models: Simultaneous estimation and robustness to misspecifications+Bollen,, K.

Categorical covariates can be incorporated into the model, allowing the user to obtain interval- and covariate-specific estimates of the quantities of interest.

Attributable and unattributable risks and fractions and other scenario comparisons,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2013,12,83,"Scenarios are alternative versions of the same dataset with the same variables but different observations or values. Applied scientists frequently want to predict how much good an intervention will do by comparing outcomes from the same model between different scenarios. Alternatively, they may want to compare outcomes between different models applied to the same scenario, for instance, when standardizing statistics from different subpopulations to a common gender and age distribution. Standard Stata tools for scenario means and comparisons are margins and pwcompare. A suite of packages is presented for estimating scenario means and comparisons by using margins, together with normalizing and variance-stabilizing transformations implemented by using n1com. margprev estimates marginal prevalences; marglmean estimates marginal arithmetic means; regpar estimates the difference between two marginal prevalences (the population attributable risk); punaf estimates the ratio between two marginal arithmetic means (the population unattributable fraction); and punaf cc estimates a marginal mean between-scenario risk or hazard ratio for case control or survival data (also known as a population unattributable fraction). The population unattributable fraction and its confidence limits are subtracted from 1 to estimate the population attributable fraction.

To lessen these challenges, I provide some useful tips and guard against some pitfalls by featuring two official Stata routines: the string() function and its elaborated wrapper, the tostring command.

Flexible parametric illness-death models,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2013,12,2,"It is usual in time-to-event data to have more than one event of interest, for example, time to death from different causes. Competing risks models can be applied in these situations where events are considered mutually exclusive absorbing states. That is, we have some initial state for example, alive with a diagnosis of cancer and we are interested in several different endpoints, all of which are final. However, the progression of disease will usually consist of one or more intermediary events that may alter the progression to an endpoint. These events are neither initial states nor absorbing states. Here we consider one of the simplest multistate models, the illness-death model. stpm2illd is a postestimation command used after fitting a flexible parametric survival model with stpm2 to estimate the probability of being in each of four states as a function of time. There is also the option to generate confidence intervals and transition hazard functions.

Implementation of a double-hurdle model,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2013,5,7,"Corner solution responses are frequently observed in the social sciences. One common approach to model phenomena that give rise to corner solution responses is to use the tobit model. If the decision to participate in the market is decoupled from the consumption amount decision, then the tobit model is inappropriate. In these cases, the double-hurdle model presented in Cragg (1971, Econometrica 39: 829-844) is an appropriate alternative to the tobit model. In this article; I introduce a command, dblhurdle, that fits the double-hurdle model. The implementation allows the errors of the participation decision and the amount decision to be correlated.

Testing for zero inflation in count models: Bias correction for the Vuong test,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2013,22,23,"The proportion of zeros in event-count processes may be inflated by an additional mechanism by which zeros are created. This has given rise to statistical models that accommodate zero inflation; these are available in Stata through the zip and zinb commands. The Vuong (1989, Econometrica 57: 307-333) test is regularly used to determine whether estimating a zero-inflation component is appropriate or whether a single-equation count model should be used. The use of the Vuong test in this case is complicated by the fact that zero-inflated models involve the estimation of several more parameters than the single-equation models. Although Vuong (1989, Econometrica 57: 307-333) suggested corrections to the test statistic to address the comparison of models with different numbers of parameters, Stata does not implement any such correction. The result is that the Vuong test used by Stata is biased toward supporting the model with a zero-inflation component, even when no zero inflation exists in the generative process. We provide new Stata commands for computing the Vuong statistic with corrections based on the Akaike and Bayesian (Schwarz) information criteria. In an extensive Monte Carlo study, we illustrate the bias inherent in using the uncorrected Vuong test, and we examine the relative merits of the Akaike and Schwarz corrections. Then, in an empirical example from international relations research, we show that errors in selecting an event-count model can have clear implications for substantive conclusions.","st0319,zipcv,zinbcv,count models,Poisson,zero-inflated Poisson,negative binomial,zero-inflated negative binomial,Vuong test,AIC,BIC,zip,zinb","SELECTION,LIKELIHOOD,MORTALITY","Desmarais, Bruce A.@Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polit Sci, Amherst, MA 01003 USA@Univ Massachusetts, Computat Social Sci Initiat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA::Harden, Jeffrey J.@Univ Colorado, Dept Polit Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Desmarais, Bruce A.@University of Massachusetts Amherst@University of Massachusetts System::Harden, Jeffrey J.@University of Colorado System@University of Colorado Boulder","HARDEN, JEFF@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5337-7918","Let's put garbage-can regressions and garbage-can probits where they belong+Achen, CH+CONFLICT MANAGEMENT AND PEACE SCIENCE+WIN 2005::NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::Cooperation in microcredit borrowing groups: Identity, sanctions, and reciprocity in the production of collective goods+Anthony, D+AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW+JUN 2005::EQ-5D as a predictor of mortality and hospitalization in elderly people+Cavrini, Giulia; Broccoli, Serena; Puccini, Aurora; et al.+QUALITY OF LIFE RESEARCH+MAR 2012::Democratization and international conflict: The impact of institutional legacies+Clare, Joe+JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH+MAY 2007::Diverting with benevolent military force: Reducing risks and rising above strategic behavior+Kisangani, Emizet F.; Pickering, Jeffrey+INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY+JUN 2007::Generalised information criteria in model selection+Konishi, S; Kitagawa, G+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1996::ON INFORMATION AND SUFFICIENCY+KULLBACK, S; LEIBLER, RA+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1951::ZERO-INFLATED POISSON REGRESSION, WITH AN APPLICATION TO DEFECTS IN MANUFACTURING+LAMBERT, D+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1992::An in-depth empirical analysis of patent citation counts using zero-inflated count data model: The case of KIST+Lee, Yong-Gil; Lee, Jeong-Dong; Song, Yong-Il; et al.+SCIENTOMETRICS+JAN 2007::no title+Long, J.+Regression models for categorical and limited dependent variables+1997::The complexity of tolerance and intolerance judgments: A response to Gibson+Mondak, JJ; Sanders, MS+POLITICAL BEHAVIOR+DEC 2005::SPECIFICATION AND TESTING OF SOME MODIFIED COUNT DATA MODELS+MULLAHY, J+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+DEC 1986::Foreign terror on Americans+Neumayer, Eric; Pluemper, Thomas+JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH+JAN 2011::Dynamic wildlife habitat models: Seasonal foods and mortality risk predict occupancy-abundance and habitat selection in grizzly bears+Nielsen, Scott E.; McDermid, Greg; Stenhouse, Gordon B.; et al.+BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION+JUL 2010::ESTIMATING DIMENSION OF A MODEL+SCHWARZ, G+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1978::Model selection for probabilistic clustering using cross-validated likelihood+Smyth, P+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+JAN 2000::Risk factors associated with Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis seropositivity in Canadian dairy cows and herds+Tiwari, A.; VanLeeuwen, J.

Our implementation jointly estimates means and quantiles of the potential-outcome distributions, allowing for multiple, discrete treatment levels.

Simulation-based sample-size calculation for designing new clinical trials and diagnostic test accuracy studies to update an existing meta-analysis,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2013,17,4,"In this article, we describe a suite of commands that enable the user to estimate the probability that the conclusions of a meta-analysis will change with the inclusion of a new study, as described previously by Sutton et al. (2007, Statistics in Medicine 26: 2479-2500). Using the metasim command, we take a simulation approach to estimating the effects in future studies. The method assumes that the effect sizes of future studies are consistent with those observed previously, as represented by the current meta-analysis. Two-arm randomized controlled trials and studies of diagnostic test accuracy are considered for a variety of outcome measures. Calculations are possible under both fixed- and random-effects assumptions, and several approaches to inference, including statistical significance and limits of clinical significance, are possible. Calculations for specific sample sizes can be conducted (by using metapow). Plots, akin to traditional power curves, can be produced (by using metapowplot) to indicate the probability that a new study will change inferences for a range of sample sizes. Finally, plots of the simulation results are overlaid on extended funnel plots by using extfunnel, described in Crowther, Langan, and Sutton (2012, Stata Journal 12: 605-622), which can help to intuitively explain the results of such calculations of sample size. We hope the command will be useful to trialists who want to assess the potential impact new trials will have on the overall evidence base and to meta-analysts who want to assess the robustness of the current meta-analysis to the inclusion of future data.","st0304,metasim,metapow,metapowplot,meta-analysis,diagnostic test,sample size,evidence-based medicine","GRAPHICAL AUGMENTATIONS,SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS,FUNNEL PLOT,IMPACT","Crowther, Michael J.@Univ Leicester, Dept Hlth Sci, Leicester, Leics, England::Hinchliffe, Sally R.@Univ Leicester, Dept Hlth Sci, Leicester, Leics, England::Donald, Alison@Univ Leicester, Dept Hlth Sci, Leicester, Leics, England::Sutton, Alex J.@Univ Leicester, Dept Hlth Sci, Leicester, Leics, England","Crowther, Michael J.@University of Leicester::Hinchliffe, Sally R.@University of Leicester::Donald, Alison@University of Leicester::Sutton, Alex J.@University of Leicester","Crowther, Michael@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8378-8259","Antibiotics versus placebo in the common cold (Cochrane Review)+Arroll, B.; Kenealy, T.+Cochrane Library Oxford+1999::The use of systematic reviews when designing studies+Cooper, NJ; Jones, DR; Sutton, AJ+CLINICAL TRIALS+2005::Graphical augmentations to the funnel plot to assess the impact of a new study on an existing meta-analysis+Crowther, Michael J.; Langan, Dean; Sutton, Alex J.+STATA JOURNAL+2012::MIDAS: Stata module for meta-analytical integration of diagnostic test accuracy studies+Dwamena, B.+Statistical software components S456880+2007::Power by simulation+Feiveson, A.+Stata J+2002::Empirical assessment suggests that existing evidence could be used more fully in designing randomized controlled trials+Goudie, Alison C.; Sutton, Alexander J.; Jones, David R.; et al.+JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY+SEP 2010::metandi: Meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy using hierarchical logistic regression+Harbord, Roger M.; Whiting, Penny+STATA JOURNAL+2009::metan: fixed- and random-effects meta-analysis+Harris, Ross J.; Bradburn, Michael J.; Deeks, Jonathan J.; et al.+STATA JOURNAL+2008::Using meta-analysis to inform the design of subsequent studies of diagnostic test accuracy+Hinchliffe, Sally R.; Crowther, Michael J.; Phillips, Robert S.; et al.+RESEARCH SYNTHESIS METHODS+JUN 2013::The diagnostic value of digital rectal examination in primary care screening for prostate cancer: a meta-analysis+Hoogendam, A; Buntinx, F; de Vet, HCW+FAMILY PRACTICE+DEC 1999::Graphical augmentations to the funnel plot assess the impact of additional evidence on a meta-analysis+Langan, Dean; Higgins, Julian P.

Computing adjusted risk ratios and risk differences in Stata,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2013,15,46,"In this article, we explain how to calculate adjusted risk ratios and risk differences when reporting results from logit, probit, and related nonlinear models. Building on Stata's margins command, we create a new postestimation command, adjrr, that calculates adjusted risk ratios and adjusted risk differences after running a logit or probit model with a binary, a multinomial, or an ordered outcome. adjrr reports the point estimates, delta-method standard errors, and 95% confidence intervals and can compute these for specific values of the variable of interest. It automatically adjusts for complex survey design as in the fit model. Data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey are used to illustrate multiple applications of the command.","st0306,adjrr,risk ratio,adjusted risk ratio,risk difference,adjusted risk difference,odds ratio,logistic,logit,probit,multinomial,ordered","ODDS RATIOS,CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS,LOGISTIC-REGRESSION,RELATIVE RISKS,COMMON","Norton, Edward C.@Univ Michigan, Dept Hlth Management & Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA@Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA@Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA::Miller, Morgen M.@Univ Michigan, Dept Hlth Management & Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA@Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA::Kleinman, Lawrence C.@Mt Sinai, Dept Hlth Evidence & Policy, Icahn Sch Med, New York, NY USA@Mt Sinai, Dept Pediat, Icahn Sch Med, New York, NY USA","Norton, Edward C.@University of Michigan@University of Michigan System@National Bureau of Economic Research::Miller, Morgen M.@University of Michigan@University of Michigan System::Kleinman, Lawrence C.@Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai",not exist,"Odds ratios should be avoided when events are common+Altman, DG; Deeks, JJ; Sackett, DL+BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL+NOV 7 1998::On the state of the art: risk communication to the public+Bier, VM+RELIABILITY ENGINEERING &amp; SYSTEM SAFETY+FEB 2001::The Relative Merits of Risk Ratios and Odds Ratios+Cummings, Peter+ARCHIVES OF PEDIATRICS &amp; ADOLESCENT MEDICINE+MAY 2009::Estimating adjusted risk ratios for matched and unmatched data: An update+Cummings, Peter+STATA JOURNAL+2011::Methods for estimating adjusted risk ratios+Cummings, Peter+STATA JOURNAL+2009::LARGE SAMPLE CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS FOR REGRESSION STANDARDIZED RISKS, RISK RATIOS, AND RISK DIFFERENCES+FLANDERS, WD; RHODES, PH+JOURNAL OF CHRONIC DISEASES+1987::Model-based estimation of relative risks and other epidemiologic measures in studies of common outcomes and in case-control studies+Greenland, S+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+AUG 15 2004::INTERPRETATION AND CHOICE OF EFFECT MEASURES IN EPIDEMIOLOGIC ANALYSES+GREENLAND, S+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+MAY 1987::ESTIMATING STANDARDIZED RISK DIFFERENCES FROM ODDS RATIOS+GREENLAND, S; HOLLAND, P+BIOMETRICS+MAR 1991::HOW WELL THE MEDIA REPORT HEALTH RISK+KLAIDMAN, S+DAEDALUS+FAL 1990::What's the Risk?

Valid tests when instrumental variables do not perfectly satisfy the exclusion restriction,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2013,17,5,"There is a growing consensus that it is difficult to pick instruments that perfectly satisfy the exclusion restriction. Drawing on results from Berkowitz, Caner, and Fang (2012, Journal of Econometrics 166: 255-266), we provide in this article a nontechnical summary of how valid inferences can be made when instrumental variables come close to satisfying the exclusion restriction. Although the Anderson-Rubin (1949, Annals of Mathematical Statistics 20: 46-63) test statistic is robust to weak identification, it assumes that the instruments are perfectly orthogonal to the structural error term and is therefore oversized under mild violations of the orthogonality condition. The fractionally resampled Anderson-Rubin (FAR) test is a modification of the Anderson-Rubin test that accounts for violations of the orthogonality condition. We show that in small samples, the size of the resampling block of the FAR test can be modified to obtain valid critical values and analyze its size and power properties. We focus on power and not on size-adjusted power because the FAR test uses only one critical value in its application. We also describe user-written commands to implement the Anderson-Rubin and FAR tests in Stata.","st0307,far,fractionally resampled Anderson-Rubin test,exclusion restriction,instrumental variables,near exogeneity",INSTITUTIONS,"Riquelme, Andres@N Carolina State Univ, Dept Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA::Berkowitz, Daniel@Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Econ, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA::Caner, Mehmet@N Carolina State Univ, Dept Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Riquelme, Andres@University of North Carolina@North Carolina State University::Berkowitz, Daniel@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@University of Pittsburgh::Caner, Mehmet@University of North Carolina@North Carolina State University",not exist,"The colonial origins of comparative development: An empirical investigation+Acemoglu, D; Johnson, S; Robinson, JA+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+DEC 2001::Unbundling institutions+Acemoglu, D; Johnson, S+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+OCT 2005::no title+Acemoglu, D.+Reply to the revised (2008) version of David Albouy's ''The colonial origins of comparative development: An investigation of the settler mortality data''+2008::Hither thou shalt come, but no further: Reply to ''The colonial origins of comparative development: An empirical investigation: Comment''+Acemoglu, D.+Working Paper 16966+2011::The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Investigation of the Settler Mortality Data+Albouy, David Y.+Working Paper 14130+2008::ESTIMATION OF THE PARAMETERS OF A SINGLE EQUATION IN A COMPLETE SYSTEM OF STOCHASTIC EQUATIONS+ANDERSON, TW; RUBIN, H+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1949::LIFETIME EARNINGS AND THE VIETNAM ERA DRAFT LOTTERY - EVIDENCE FROM SOCIAL-SECURITY ADMINISTRATIVE RECORDS+ANGRIST, JD+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+JUN 1990::Are ""Nearly Exogenous Instruments"" reliable?+Berkowitz, Daniel; Caner, Mehmet; Fang, Ying+ECONOMICS LETTERS+OCT 2008::The validity of instruments revisited+Berkowitz, Daniel; Caner, Mehmet; Fang, Ying+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+FEB 2012::A joint test of structural and correlation parameters in instrumental variables regression when perfect exogeneity is violated+Caner, M.; Morrill, M.+Working Paper+2010::Using Geographic Variation in College Proximity to Estimate the Return to Schooling+Card, D.+Aspects of Labour Market Behavior: Essays in Honour of John Vanderkamp+1995::Do institutions cause growth?+Glaeser, EL; La Porta, R; Lopez-de-Silanes, F; et al.+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC GROWTH+SEP 2004::ON THE ASYMPTOTIC SIZE DISTORTION OF TESTS WHEN INSTRUMENTS LOCALLY VIOLATE THE EXOGENEITY ASSUMPTION+Guggenberger, Patrik+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+APR 2012::Implementing tests with correct size in the simultaneous equations model+MOREIRA, M.J.; POI, B.P.+Stata Journal, Stata Coop LP+2003::GMM with weak identification+Stock, JH; Wright, JH+ECONOMETRICA+SEP 2000::Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data, 2nd Edition+Wooldridge, JM+ECONOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF CROSS SECTION AND PANEL DATA, 2ND EDITION+2010::ON THE ASYMPTOTIC PROPERTIES OF THE JACKKNIFE HISTOGRAM+WU, CFJ+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+SEP 1990"

In addition to the previously implemented tests, metabias implements two new tests that are recommended in the recently updated Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins and Green 2008). The first new test, proposed by Harbord, Egger, and Sterne (2006, Statistics in Medicine 25: 3443-3457), is a modified version of the commonly used test proposed by Egger et al. (1997, British Medical Journal 315: 629-634). It regresses Z/root V against root V, where Z is the efficient score and V is Fisher's information (the variance of Z under the null hypothesis). The second new test is Peters' test, which is based on a weighted linear regression of the intervention effect estimate on the reciprocal of the sample size. Both of the-se tests maintain better control of the false-positive rate than the test proposed by Egger at al., while retaining similar power.","sbe19-6,metabias,meta-analysis,publication bias,small-study effects,funnel plots","DETECT PUBLICATION BIAS,CLINICAL-TRIALS,GRAPHICAL TEST,FUNNEL PLOTS,OUTCOMES","Harbord, Roger M.@Univ Bristol, Dept Social Med, Bristol, Avon, England::Harris, Ross J.@Hlth Protect Agcy, Ctr Infect, London, England::Sterne, Jonathan A.

Even in the simplest case, when the data are summarized by a 2 x 2 table from each study, a statistically rigorous analysis requires hierarchical (multilevel) models that respect the binomial data structure, such as hierarchical logistic regression.

The commands display the results in two alternative parameterizations and produce a customizable plot. metandi requires either Stata 10 or above (which has the new command xtmelogit), or Stata 8.2 or above with gllamm installed.","st0163,metandi,metandiplot,diagnosis,meta-analysis,sensitivity and specificity,hierarchical models,generalized mixed models,gllamm,xtmelogit,receiver operating characteristic (ROC),summary ROC,hierarchical summary ROC","SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS,SPECIFICITY,SENSITIVITY,REGIONS,CANCER,MODELS,CURVE,TESTS","Harbord, Roger M.@Univ Bristol, Dept Social Med, Bristol, Avon, England::Whiting, Penny@Unknow","Harbord, Roger M.@University of Bristol::Whiting, Penny@Unknow","Harbord, Roger@A-8699-2008@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2257-8271::Whiting, Penny@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1138-5682","Graphing confidence ellipses: An update of ellip for Stata 8+Alexandersson, A.+Stata Journal+2004::Bivariate random effects meta-analysis of ROC curves+Arends, L.

Two techniques for investigating interactions between treatment and continuous covariates in clinical trials,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2009,12,18,"There is increasing interest in the medical world in the possibility of tailoring treatment to the individual patient. Statistically, the relevant task is to identify interactions between covariates and treatments, such that the patient's value of a given covariate influences how strongly (or even whether) they are likely to respond to a treatment. The most valuable data are obtained in randomized controlled clinical trials of novel treatments in comparison with a control treatment. We describe two techniques to detect and model such interactions. The first technique, multivariable fractional polynomials interaction, is based on fractional polynomials methodology, and provides a method of testing for continuous-by-binary interactions and by modeling the treatment effect as a function of a continuous covariate. The second technique, subpopulation treatment-effect pattern plot, aims to do something similar but is focused on producing a nonparametric estimate of the treatment effect, expressed graphically. Stata programs for both of these techniques are described. Real data for brain and breast cancer are used as examples.","st0164,mfpi,mfpi_plot,stepp_tail,stepp_window,stepp_plot,continuous covariates,treatment-covariate interaction,clinical trials,fractional polynomials,subpopulation treatment-effect pattern plot","SUBSETS,CANCER,MODEL","Royston, Patrick@MRC Clin Trials Unit, Canc Methodol Grp, London, England@MRC Clin Trials Unit, Stat Methodol Grp, London, England::Sauerbrei, Willi@Univ Freiburg, Med Ctr, Inst Med Biometry & Med Informat, D-7800 Freiburg, Germany","Royston, Patrick@Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit::Sauerbrei, Willi@University of Freiburg",not exist,"Patterns of treatment effects in subsets of patients in clinical trials+Bonetti, M; Gelber, RD+BIOSTATISTICS+JUL 2004::A graphical method to assess treatment-covariate interactions using the Cox model on subsets of the data+Bonetti, M; Gelber, RD+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+OCT 15 2000::Tarnoxifen fur early breast cancer: an overview of the modernised trials+no author+Lancet+1998::Cell cycle regulators and outcome of adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy in completely resected non-small-cell lung cancer: The international adjuvant lung cancer trial biologic program+Filipits, Martin; Pirker, Robert; Dunant, Ariane; et al.+JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY+JUL 1 2007::REGRESSION USING FRACTIONAL POLYNOMIALS OF CONTINUOUS COVARIATES - PARSIMONIOUS PARAMETRIC MODELING+ROYSTON, P; ALTMAN, DG+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+1994::no title+Royston, P; Sauerbrei, W.+Multivariable model-building: A pragmatic approach to regression analysis based on fractional polynomials for modelling continuous variables+2008::A new measure of prognostic separation in survival data+Royston, P; Sauerbrei, W+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+MAR 15 2004::Building multivariable prognostic and diagnostic models: transformation of the predictors by using fractional polynomials+Sauerbrei, W; Royston, P+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1999::A BOOTSTRAP RESAMPLING PROCEDURE FOR MODEL-BUILDING - APPLICATION TO THE COX REGRESSION-MODEL+SAUERBREI, W; SCHUMACHER, M+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+DEC 1992::Detecting an interaction between treatment and a continuous covariate: A comparison of two approaches+Sauerbrei, Willi; Royston, Patrick; Zapien, Karina+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+MAY 1 2007::Randomized and non-randomized patients in clinical trials: Experiences with Comprehensive Cohort Studies+Schmoor, C; Olschewski, M; Schumacher, M+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+FEB 15 1996::no title+ULM K+BIOMETRIE INFORMATIK+1989"

Further development of flexible parametric models for survival analysis,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2009,13,198,"Royston and Parmar (2002, Statistics in Medicine 21: 2175-2197) developed a class of flexible parametric survival models that were programmed in Stata with the stpm command (Royston, 2001, Stata Journal 1: 1-28). In this article, we introduce a new command, stpm2, that extends the methodology. New features for stpm2 include improvement in the way time-dependent covariates are modeled, with these effects far less likely to be over parameterized; the ability to incorporate expected mortality and thus fit relative survival models; and a superior predict command that enables simple quantification of differences between any two covariate patterns through calculation of time-dependent hazard ratios, hazard differences, and survival differences. The ideas are illustrated through a study of breast cancer survival and incidence of hip fracture in prostate cancer patients.","st0165,stpm2,survival analysis,relative survival,time-dependent effects","RELATIVE SURVIVAL,REGRESSION-MODELS","Lambert, Paul C.@Univ Leicester, Dept Hlth Sci, Ctr Biostat & Genet Epidemiol, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England::Royston, Patrick@MRC, Clin Trials Unit, London, England","Lambert, Paul C.@University of Leicester::Royston, Patrick@Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit","Benneyworth, Brian@A-4667-2009@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4692-5303","ON 2 FAMILIES OF TRANSFORMATIONS TO ADDITIVITY FOR BINARY RESPONSE DATA+ARANDAORDAZ, FJ+BIOMETRIKA+1981::Deriving more up-to-date estimates of long-term patient survival+Brenner, H; Gefeller, O+JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY+FEB 1997::no title+CARTENSEN B+WHO NEEDS COX MODEL+2004::Age at diagnosis and the choice of survival analysis methods in cancer epidemiology+Cheung, YB; Gao, F; Khoo, KS+JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY+JAN 2003::no title+Cleves, M.

"Improved degrees of freedom for multivariate significance tests obtained from multiply imputed, small-sample data",STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2009,14,5,"We propose improvements to existing degrees of freedom used for significance testing of multivariate hypotheses in small samples when missing data are handled using multiple imputation. The improvements are for 1) tests based on unrestricted fractions of missing information and 2) tests based on equal fractions of missing information with M(p - 1) <= 4, where M is the number of imputations and p is the number of tested parameters. Using the m1 command avialable as of Stata 11, we demonstrate via simulation that using these adjustments can result in a more sensible degrees of freedom (and hence closer-to-nominal rejection rates) than existing degrees of freedom.","st0170,multiple imputation,degrees of freedom,sample,missing,testing,multivariate","MISSING VALUES,IMPUTATION,UPDATE","Marchenko, Yulia V.@StataCorp, College Stn, TX USA::Reiter, Jerome P.@Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC USA","Marchenko, Yulia V.@Unknow::Reiter, Jerome P.@Duke University",not exist,"Small-sample degrees of freedom with multiple imputation+Barnard, J; Rubin, DB+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1999::A new framework for managing and analyzing multiply imputed data in Stata+Carlin, John B.; Galati, John C.; Royston, Patrick+STATA JOURNAL+2008::LARGE-SAMPLE SIGNIFICANCE LEVELS FROM MULTIPLY IMPUTED DATA USING MOMENT-BASED STATISTICS AND AN F-REFERENCE DISTRIBUTION+LI, KH; RAGHUNATHAN, TE; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1991::no title+Little, RJA; Rubin, DB.+Statistical Analysis with Missing Data.+2002::Small-sample degrees of freedom for multi-component significance tests with multiple imputation for missing data+Reiter, Jerome P.+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 2007::The multiple adaptations of multiple imputation+Reiter, Jerome P.; Raghunathan, Trivellore E.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2007::Multiple imputation of missing values+Roysten, P.+Stata J.+2004::no title+ROYSTON P+STATA J+2005::Multiple imputation of missing values: update+Royston, P+STATA JOURNAL+2005::Multiple imputation of missing values: New features for mim+Royston, Patrick; Carlin, John B.; White, Ian R.+STATA JOURNAL+2009::Multiple imputation of missing values: further update of ice, with an emphasis on interval censoring+Royston, Patrick+STATA JOURNAL+2007::no title+Rubin, DB.+Multiple Imputation for Nonresponse in Surveys+1987::no title+Schafer, JL.+Analysis of incomplete multivariate data+1997::no title+no author+Stata Multiple-Imputation Reference Manual+2009"
Implementing weak-instrument robust tests for a general class of instrumental-variables models,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2009,16,60,"We present a minimum distance approach for conducting hypothesis testing in the presence of potentially weak instruments. Under tlus approach, We propose size-correct tests for limited dependent variable models with endogenous explanatory variables such as endogenous tobit and probit models. Additionally, we extend weak-instrument tests for the linear instrumental-variables model by allowing for variance-covariance estimation that is robust to arbitrary heteroskedasticity or intracluster dependence. We invert these tests to construct confidence intervals on the coefficient of the endogenous variable. We also provide a postestimation command for Stata, called r1vtest for computing the tests and estimating confidence intervals.","st0171,r1vtest,1vregress,1vprobit,1vtobit,cond1vreg,ivreg2,weak instrements,endogenous tobit,endogenous probit two-stage least squares,hypothesis testing,confidence intervals","IDENTIFICATION,INFERENCE,MOMENTS","Finlay, Keith@Tulane Univ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA::Magnusson, Leandro M.@Tulane Univ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA","Finlay, Keith@Tulane University::Magnusson, Leandro M.@Tulane University","Magnusson, Leandro@H-5347-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3691-9214","ESTIMATION OF THE PARAMETERS OF A SINGLE EQUATION IN A COMPLETE SYSTEM OF STOCHASTIC EQUATIONS+ANDERSON, TW; RUBIN, H+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1949::Performance of conditional Wald tests in IV regression with weak instruments+Andrews, Donald W.

One major complication is the possible unit root at seasonal frequencies. In this article, I tackle the issue of implementing a test to identify the source of seasonality.

"A menu-driven facility for sample-size calculation in novel multiarm, multistage randomized controlled trials with a time-to-event outcome",STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2009,9,11,"We present menu- and command-driven Stata programs for the calculation of sample size, number of events, and trial duration for a novel type of clinical trial design with a time-to-event outcome and two or more experimental arms. The approach is based oil terminating accrual of patients to inferior experimental treatment; arms at all early stage in the trial, allowing through to the next stage only treatments that show a predefined degree of advantage against the control treatment. The first stage of testing uses an intermediate outcome measure for the definitive (primary) outcome rather than with the primary outcome itself. The experimental arms are compared pairwise with the control arm according to the intermediate outcome measure. Arms that survive the comparison enter the next stage of patient accrual, culminating in comparisons against control on the primary outcome measure.

The features supported include unequal patient allocation, target hazard ratios that may differ from 1 under the mull hypothesis, and the ability to stop patient recruitment at a specified time after trial initiation. The computations of sample size and power are based on the asymptotic mean and variance of the log hazard-ratio under the null and alternative hypotheses. The overall operating characteristics are computed from the intermediate and final stage significance levels and power, and the correlation between the log hazard-ratios oil the intermediate and primary outcome measures at the different stages. We illustrate the approach with the design of a United Kingdom Medical Research Council six-arm trial ill prostate cancer in which the intermediate outcome is failure-free survival and the primary outcome is overall survival.","st0175,nstage,nstagemenu,multiple arms,randomized controlled trial,survival analysis,surrogate marker,multistage trial","OVARIAN-CANCER,CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE,PACLITAXEL,CISPLATIN","Barthel, Friederike M-S.@GlaxoSmithKline Inc, Oncol R&D, London, England::Royston, Patrick@MRC Clin Trials Unit, London, England::Parmar, Mahesh K.

cem: Coarsened exact matching in Stata,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2009,17,250,"In this article, we introduce a Stata implementation of coarsened exact matching, a new method for improving the estimation of causal effects by reducing imbalance in covariates between treated and control groups. Coarsened exact matching is faster, is easier to use and understand, requires fewer assumptions, is more easily automated, and possesses more attractive statistical properties for many applications than do existing matching methods. In coarsened exact matching, users temporarily coarsen their data, exact match on these coarsened data, and then run their analysis on the uncoarsened, matched data. Coarsened exact matching bounds the degree of model dependence and causal effect estimation error by ex ante user choice, is monotonic imbalance bounding (so that reducing the maximum imbalance on one variable has no effect on others), does not require a separate procedure to restrict data to common support, meets the congruence principle., is approximately invariant to measurement error, balances all nonlinearities and interactions in sample (i.e., not merely in expectation), and works with multiply imputed datasets. Other matching methods inherit many of the coarsened exact matching method's properties when applied to further match data preprocessed by coarsened exact matching.

Bootstrap assessment of the stability of multivariable models,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2009,13,18,"Assessing the instability of a multivariable model is important but is rarely done in practice. Model instability occurs when selected predictors-and for multivariable fractional polynomial modeling, selected functions of continuous predictors-are sensitive to small changes in the data. Bootstrap analysis is a useful technique for investigating variations among selected models in samples drawn at random with replacement. Such samples mimic datasets that are structurally similar to that under study and that could plausibly have arisen instead. The bootstrap inclusion fraction of a candidate variable usefully indicates the importance of the variable. We describe Stata tools for stability analysis in the context, of the mfp command for multivariable model building. We offer practical guidance and illustrate the application of the tools to a study in prostate cancer.","st0177,mfp,fracpoly,mfpboot,mfpboot_bif,pmbeval,pmbevalfn,pmbstabil,continuous covariates,fractional polynomials,multivariable modeling,stability,bootstrap,bagging","REGRESSION-MODEL,SELECTION,PREDICTORS,VARIABLES","Royston, Patrick@MRC Clin Trials Unit, Hub Trials Methodol Res, London, England@UCL, London, England::Sauerbrei, Willi@Univ Freiburg, Med Ctr, Inst Med Biometry & Med Informat, D-7800 Freiburg, Germany","Royston, Patrick@University College London@University of London@Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit::Sauerbrei, Willi@University of Freiburg","Benneyworth, Brian@A-4667-2009@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4692-5303","The practical utility of incorporating model selection uncertainty into prognostic models for survival data+Augustin, N; Sauerbrei, W; Schumacher, M+STATISTICAL MODELLING+JUL 2005::Stability analysis of an additive spline model for respiratory health data by using knot removal+Binder, Harald; Sauerbrei, Willi+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2009::Heuristics of instability and stabilization in model selection+Breiman, L+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1996::Bagging predictors+Breiman, L+MACHINE LEARNING+AUG 1996::Model selection: An integral part of inference+Buckland, ST; Burnham, KP; Augustin, NH+BIOMETRICS+JUN 1997::THE BOOTSTRAP AND IDENTIFICATION OF PROGNOSTIC FACTORS VIA COX PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS REGRESSION-MODEL+CHEN, CH; GEORGE, SL+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+1985::no title+Royston, P; Sauerbrei, W.+Multivariable model-building: A pragmatic approach to regression analysis based on fractional polynomials for modelling continuous variables+2008::Stability of multivariable fractional polynomial models with selection of variables and transformations: a bootstrap investigation+Royston, P; Sauerbrei, W+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+FEB 28 2003::The use of resampling methods to simplify regression models in medical statistics+Sauerbrei, W+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+1999::A BOOTSTRAP RESAMPLING PROCEDURE FOR MODEL-BUILDING - APPLICATION TO THE COX REGRESSION-MODEL+SAUERBREI, W; SCHUMACHER, M+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+DEC 1992::Investigation about a screening step in model selection+Sauerbrei, Willi; Hollaender, Norbert; Buchholz, Anika+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+JUN 2008::Selection of important variables and determination of functional form for continuous predictors in multivariable model building+Sauerbrei, Willi; Royston, Patrick; Binder, Harald+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+DEC 30 2007::PROSTATE SPECIFIC ANTIGEN IN THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE PROSTATE .2.

Partial effects in probit and logit models with a triple dummy-variable interaction term,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2009,7,18,"In nonlinear regression models, such as probit or logit models, coefficients cannot be interpreted as partial effects. The partial effects are usually nonlinear combinations of all regressors and regression coefficients of the model. We derive the partial effects in such models with a triple dummy-variable interaction term. The formulas derived here are implemented in the Stata inteff3 command. The command also applies the delta method to compute the standard errors of the partial effects. We illustrate the use of the command with an empirical application, analyzing how the gender gap in labor-market participation is affected by the presence of children and a university degree. We find that the presence of children increases the gender gap in labor-market participation but that this increase is smaller for more highly educated individuals.","st0178,inteff3,probit model,dummy variables,interaction terms,partial effects,Stata,labor-market participation",,"Cornelissen, Thomas@UCL, Dept Econ, Ctr Res & Anal Migrat, London WC1E 6BT, England::Sonderhof, Katja@Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Labour Econ, Dept Econ & Management, Hannover, Germany","Cornelissen, Thomas@University College London@University of London::Sonderhof, Katja@IZA Institute Labor Economics@University of Hannover","Cornelissen, Thomas@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8259-5105","Interaction terms in logit and probit models+Ai, CR; Norton, EC+ECONOMICS LETTERS+JUL 2003::no title+Davidson, R; MacKinnon, JG.+EconometrIc theory and methods+2003::no title+Greene, W.

Fitting and interpreting Cragg's tobit alternative using Stata,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2009,8,86,"In this article, I introduce the user-written command craggit, which simultaneously fits both tiers of Cragg's (1971, Econometrica 39: 829-844) ""two-tier"" (sometimes called ""two-stage"" or ""double-hurdle"") alternative to tobit for corner-solution models. A key limitation to the tobit model is that the probability of a positive value and the actual value, given that it is positive, are determined by the same underlying process (i.e., the same parameters). Cragg proposed a more flexible alternative that allows these outcomes to be determined by separate processes through the incorporation of a probit model in the first tier and a truncated normal model in the second. Also, tobit is nested in craggit, making the latter a popular choice among ""two-tier"" models. In the article, I also present postestimation syntax to facilitate the understanding and interpretation of results.","st0179,craggit,two tier,two stage,double hurdle,corner-solution models,Craggit's tobit",LIMITED DEPENDENT-VARIABLES,"Burke, William J.@Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Burke, William J.@Michigan State University",not exist,"no title+Baum, C.+An Introduction to Modern Econometrics Using Stata+2006::SOME STATISTICAL MODELS FOR LIMITED DEPENDENT VARIABLES WITH APPLICATION TO DEMAND FOR DURABLE GOODS+CRAGG, JG+ECONOMETRICA+1971::no title+Kennedy, Peter.+A Guide to Econometrics+2003::no title+Pindyck, R.; Rubinfeld, D.+Econometric Models and Economic Forecasts+1998::ESTIMATION OF RELATIONSHIPS FOR LIMITED DEPENDENT-VARIABLES+TOBIN, J+ECONOMETRICA+1958::no title+Wooldridge, J.+Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach+2009::no title+Wooldridge,, J.

A tool for deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis of epidemiologic studies,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2008,17,50,"Classification errors, selection bias, and uncontrolled confounders are likely to be present in most epidemiologic studies, but the uncertainty introduced by these types of biases is seldom quantified. The authors present a simple yet easy-to-use Stata command to adjust the relative risk for exposure misclassification, selection bias, and an unmeasured confounder. This command implements both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. It allows the user to specify a variety of probability distributions for the bias parameters, which are used to simulate distributions for the bias-adjusted exposure-disease relative risk. We illustrate the command by applying it to a case-control study of occupational resin exposure and lung-cancer deaths. By using plausible probability distributions for the bias parameters, investigators can report results that incorporate their uncertainties regarding systematic errors and thus avoid overstating their certainty about the effect under study. These results can supplement conventional results and can help pinpoint major sources of conflict in study interpretations.","st0138,episens,episensi,sensitivity analysis,unmeasured confounder,misclassification,bias,epidemiology","OBSERVATIONAL DATA,SYSTEMATIC-ERRORS,BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS,UNCERTAINTY,RISK,CANCER,BIAS","Orsini, Nicola@Karolinska Inst, Inst Environm Med, Div Nutr Epidemiol, S-10401 Stockholm, Sweden::Bellocco, Rino@Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Stat, Milan, Italy::Bottai, Matteo@Univ S Carolina, Arnold Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Columbia, SC USA::Wolk, Alicja@Karolinska Inst, Inst Environm Med, Div Nutr Epidemiol, S-10401 Stockholm, Sweden::Greenland, Sander@Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Epidemiol Stat, Los Angeles, CA USA","Orsini, Nicola@Karolinska Institutet::Bellocco, Rino@University of Milano-Bicocca::Bottai, Matteo@University of South Carolina Columbia@University of South Carolina@University of South Carolina System::Wolk, Alicja@Karolinska Institutet::Greenland, Sander@University of California System@University of California Los Angeles","Bellocco, Rino@E-7674-2018","Sensitivity analysis of misclassification: A graphical and a Bayesian approach+Chu, Haitao; Wang, Zhaojie; Cole, Stephen R.; et al.+ANNALS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+NOV 2006::Meta-analysis by the confidence prodile method+Eddy, D; Hasselblad, V; Shachter, R.+METAANALYSIS CONFIDE+1992::A method to automate probabilistic sensitivity analyses of misclassified binary variables+Fox, MP; Lash, TL; Greenland, S+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+DEC 2005::Generalized conjugate priors for Bayesian analysis of risk and survival regressions+Greenland, S+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2003::no title+GREENLAND S+IN PRESS MODERN EPID+2008::A CASE-CONTROL STUDY OF CANCER MORTALITY AT A TRANSFORMER-ASSEMBLY FACILITY+GREENLAND, S; SALVAN, A; WEGMAN, DH; et al.+INTERNATIONAL ARCHIVES OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH+MAY 1994::Basic methods for sensitivity analysis of biases+Greenland, S+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+DEC 1996::The impact of prior distributions for uncontrolled confounding and response bias: A case study of the relation of wire codes and magnetic fields to childhood leukemia+Greenland, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2003::Multiple-bias modelling for analysis of observational data+Greenland, S+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+2005::Sensitivity analysis, Monte Carlo risk analysis, and Bayesian uncertainty assessment+Greenland, S+RISK ANALYSIS+AUG 2001::The sensitivity of a sensitivity analysis (invited paper)+Greenland, S.+1997 P BIOM SECT+1998::PROPAGATION OF UNCERTAINTY IN RISK ASSESSMENTS - THE NEED TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN UNCERTAINTY DUE TO LACK OF KNOWLEDGE AND UNCERTAINTY DUE TO VARIABILITY+HOFFMAN, FO; HAMMONDS, JS+RISK ANALYSIS+OCT 1994::Exposure-measurement error is frequently ignored when interpreting epidemiologic study results+Jurek, Anne M.; Maldonado, George; Greenland, Sander; et al.+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+DEC 2006::Semi-automated sensitivity analysis to assess systematic errors in observational data+Lash, TL; Fink, AK+EPIDEMIOLOGY+JUL 2003::Quantifying errors without random sampling.+Phillips, Carl V; LaPole, Luwanna M+BMC medical research methodology+2003-Jun-12::Quantifying and reporting uncertainty from systematic errors+Phillips, CV+EPIDEMIOLOGY+JUL 2003::Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis and Bayesian analysis of smoking as an unmeasured confounder in a study of silica and lung cancer+Steenland, K; Greenland, S+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+AUG 15 2004"
A new framework for managing and analyzing multiply imputed data in Stata,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2008,12,189,"A new set of tools is described for performing analyses of an ensemble of datasets that includes multiple copies of the original data with imputations of missing values, as required for the method of multiple imputation. The tools replace those originally developed by the authors. They are based on a simple data management paradigm in which the imputed datasets are all stored along with the original data in a single dataset with a vertically stacked format, as proposed by Royston in his ice and micombine commands. Stacking into a single dataset simplifies the management of the imputed datasets compared with storing them individually. Analysis and manipulation of the stacked datasets is performed with a new prefix command, mim, which can accommodate data imputed by any method as long as a few simple rules are followed in creating the imputed data. mim can validly fit most of the regression models available in Stata to multiply imputed datasets, giving parameter estimates and confidence intervals computed according to Rubin's results for multiple imputation inference. Particular attention is paid to limiting the available postestimation commands to those that are known to be valid within the multiple imputation context. However, the user has flexibility to override these defaults. Features of these new tools are illustrated using two previously published examples.","st0139,mim,mimstack,ice,micombine,miset,mifit,multiple imputation,missing data,missing at random",IMPUTATION,"Carlin, John B.@Murdoch Childrens Res Inst, Clin Epidemiol & Biostat Unit, Parkville, Vic, Australia@Univ Melbourne, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia::Galati, John C.@Murdoch Childrens Res Inst, Clin Epidemiol & Biostat Unit, Parkville, Vic, Australia@Univ Melbourne, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia::Royston, Patrick@MRC, Clin Trial Unit, Cancer & Stat Methodol Grp, London, England","Carlin, John B.@University of Melbourne@Murdoch Children's Research Institute::Galati, John C.@University of Melbourne@Murdoch Children's Research Institute::Royston, Patrick@Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit","Carlin, John@B-3492-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2694-9463","Small-sample degrees of freedom with multiple imputation+Barnard, J; Rubin, DB+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1999::Tools for analyzing multiple imputed datasets+Carlin, JB; Li, N; Greenwood, P.+Stata J+2003::Sensitivity analysis after multiple imputation under missing at random: a weighting approach+Carpenter, James R.; Kenward, Michael G.; White, Ian R.+STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH+2007::LARGE-SAMPLE SIGNIFICANCE LEVELS FROM MULTIPLY IMPUTED DATA USING MOMENT-BASED STATISTICS AND AN F-REFERENCE DISTRIBUTION+LI, KH; RAGHUNATHAN, TE; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1991::no title+Little, RJA; Rubin, DB.+Statistical Analysis with Missing Data.+2002::Can one assess whether missing data are missing at random in medical studies?+Potthoff, RF; Tudor, GE; Pieper, KS; et al.+STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH+2006::Multiple imputation of missing values+Roysten, P.+Stata J.+2004::no title+ROYSTON P+STATA J+2005::Multiple imputation of missing values: further update of ice, with an emphasis on interval censoring+Royston, Patrick+STATA JOURNAL+2007::Multiple imputation after 18+ years+Rubin, DB+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1996::no title+Schafer, JL.+Analysis of incomplete multivariate data+1997::Multiple imputation of missing blood pressure covariates in survival analysis+Van Buuren, S; Boshuizen, HC; Knook, DL+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+MAR 30 1999"

Speaking Stata: Spineplots and their kin,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2008,38,4,"The term spineplot has been applied over the last decade or so to a type of bar chart used particularly for showing frequencies, proportions, or percentages of two cross-classified categorical variables. The principle is that the areas of rectangular tiles are proportional to the frequencies in the cells of a contingency table. Often both coarse and fine structure are easy to see, including departures from independence. The main idea has, in fact, been rediscovered repeatedly over at least the last 130 years. In its most general form, it has been widely publicized under the name mosaic plots. This column introduces, discusses, and exemplifies a Stata implementation of spineplots. It is noted that a restriction to two variables is more apparent than real, as either axis of a spineplot can show a composite variable defined by cross combinations of two or more variables.","gr0031,spineplots,mosaic plots,bar charts,graphics,categorical data",CATEGORICAL-DATA,"Cox, Nicholas J.@Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham, England","Cox, Nicholas J.@Durham University",not exist,"no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical Data Analysis+2002::no title+ANDERSON MJ+STAT CENTURIES+2002::no title+BERTIN J+SEMINOLOGY GRAPHICS+1983::SEX BIAS IN GRADUATE ADMISSIONS - DATA FROM BERKELEY+BICKEL, PJ; HAMMEL, EA; OCONNELL, JW+SCIENCE+1975::no title+BRINTON WC+GRAPHIC METHODS PRES+1914::Interactive and Dynamic Graphics for Data Analysis: With R and Ggobi+Cook, D; Swayne, DF+INTERACTIVE AND DYNAMIC GRAPHICS FOR DATA ANALYSIS: WITH R AND GGOBI+2007::Speaking Stata: Graphing categorical and compositional data+Cox, N.

A common way to fit such a model is to take into account one of the effects by including dummy variables and to sweep out the other effect by the within transformation (fixed-effects transformation). If the number of panel units is high, creating and storing the dummy variables can involve prohibitively large computer-memory requirements. The memory-saving procedure to set up the moment matrices for estimation presented in this article can reduce the memory requirements considerably.

SNP and SML estimation of univariate and bivariate binary-choice models,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2008,20,24,"We discuss the semi-nonparametric approach of Gallant and Nychka (1987, Econometrica 55: 363-390), the serniparametric maximum likelihood approach of Klein and Spady (1993, Econometrica 61: 387-421), and a set of new Stata commands for serniparametric estimation of three binary-choice models. The first is a univariate model, while the second and the third are bivariate models without and with sample selection, respectively. The proposed estimators are root n consistent and asymptotically normal for the model parameters of interest under weak assumptions on the distribution of the underlying error terms. Our Monte Carlo simulations suggest that the efficiency losses of the semi-non parametric and the semiparametric maximum likelihood estimators relative to a maximum likelihood correctly specified estimator of a parametric probit are rather small. On the other hand, a comparison of these estimators in non-Gaussian designs suggests that semi-nonparametric and serniparametric maximum likelihood estimators substantially dominate the parametric probit maximum likelihood estimator.","st0144,snp,snp2,snp2s,sml,sml2s,binary-choice models,semi-nonparametric approach,SNP estimation,semiparametric maximum likelihood,SML estimation,Monte Carlo simulation","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,SEMIPARAMETRIC ESTIMATION,RESPONSE MODEL,PARTICIPATION,EFFICIENCY","De Luca, Giuseppe@Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy","De Luca, Giuseppe@University of Rome Tor Vergata",not exist,"ASYMPTOTIC EFFICIENCY IN SEMIPARAMETRIC MODELS WITH CENSORING+CHAMBERLAIN, G+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUL 1986::EFFICIENCY BOUNDS FOR DISTRIBUTION-FREE ESTIMATORS OF THE BINARY CHOICE AND THE CENSORED REGRESSION-MODELS+COSSLETT, SR+ECONOMETRICA+MAY 1987::DISTRIBUTION-FREE MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATOR OF THE BINARY CHOICE MODEL+COSSLETT, SR+ECONOMETRICA+1983::A sample selection model for unit and item nonresponse in cross-sectional surveys+De Luca, G.; Peracchi, F.+CEIS TOR VERGATA RES+2007::SEMINONPARAMETRIC ESTIMATION OF BINARY-CHOICE MODELS WITH AN APPLICATION TO LABOR-FORCE PARTICIPATION+GABLER, S; LAISNEY, F; LECHNER, M+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JAN 1993::SEMI-NONPARAMETRIC MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION+GALLANT, AR; NYCHKA, DW+ECONOMETRICA+MAR 1987::Parametric and semi-parametric estimation of the binary response model of labour market participation+Gerfin, M+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+MAY-JUN 1996::no title+Gould, W; Pitblado, J; Sribney, W<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Corporation, S</span>.+Maximum likelihood estimation with Stata+2006::A SMOOTHED MAXIMUM SCORE ESTIMATOR FOR THE BINARY RESPONSE MODEL+HOROWITZ, JL+ECONOMETRICA+MAY 1992::SEMIPARAMETRIC LEAST-SQUARES (SLS) AND WEIGHTED SLS ESTIMATION OF SINGLE-INDEX MODELS+ICHIMURA, H+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUL 1993::no title+ICHIMURA H+NONPARAMETRIC SEMIPA+1991::AN EFFICIENT SEMIPARAMETRIC ESTIMATOR FOR BINARY RESPONSE MODELS+KLEIN, RW; SPADY, RH+ECONOMETRICA+MAR 1993::SEMIPARAMETRIC MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION OF POLYCHOTOMOUS AND SEQUENTIAL CHOICE MODELS+LEE, LF+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+FEB 1995::Maximum score estimation of the stochastic utility model of choice+Manski, C.F.+J.

Production function estimation in Stata using the Olley and Pakes method,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2008,12,31,"Productivity is often computed by approximating the weighted sum of the inputs from the estimation of the Cobb-Douglas production function. Such estimates, however, may suffer from simultaneity and selection biases. Olley and Pakes (1996, Econometrica 64: 1263-1297) introduced a semiparametric method that allows us to estimate the production function parameters consistently and thus obtain reliable productivity measures by controlling for such biases. This study first reviews this method and then introduces a Stata command to implement it. We show that when simultaneity and selection biases are not controlled for, the coefficients for the variable inputs are biased upward and the coefficients for the fixed inputs are biased downward.","st0145,opreg,levpet,production function,bias,simultaneity","PANEL-DATA,MODELS","Yasar, Mahmut@Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Econ, Arlington, TX 76019 USA::Raciborski, Rafal@Emory Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA::Poi, Brian@StataCorp, College Stn, TX USA","Yasar, Mahmut@University of Texas System@University of Texas Arlington::Raciborski, Rafal@Emory University::Poi, Brian@Unknow",not exist,"ANOTHER LOOK AT THE INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE ESTIMATION OF ERROR-COMPONENTS MODELS+ARELLANO, M; BOVER, O+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUL 1995::SOME TESTS OF SPECIFICATION FOR PANEL DATA - MONTE-CARLO EVIDENCE AND AN APPLICATION TO EMPLOYMENT EQUATIONS+ARELLANO, M; BOND, S+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+APR 1991::no title+BARTELSMAN E+NBER PRODUCTIVITY DA+2001::GMM estimation with persistent panel data: an application to production functions+Blundell, R.; Bond, S.+Econometric Reviews+2000::Initial conditions and moment restrictions in dynamic panel data models+Blundell, R; Bond, S+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+NOV 1998::Production Functions: The Search for Identification+Griliches, Z.; Mairesse, J.+Essays in Honour of Ragnar Frisch+1998::Estimating production functions using inputs to control for unobservables+Levinsohn, J; Petrin, A+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+APR 2003::RANDOM SIMULTANEOUS EQUATIONS AND THE THEORY OF PRODUCTION+Marschak, Jacob; Andrews, William H., Jr.+ECONOMETRICA+JUL-OCT 1944::The dynamics of productivity in the telecommunications equipment industry+Olley, GS; Pakes, A+ECONOMETRICA+NOV 1996::Trade liberalization, exit, and productivity improvements: Evidence from Chilean plants+Pavcnik, N+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+JAN 2002::Production Function Estimation in Stata Using Inputs to Control for Unobservables+Petrin, Amil; Poi, Brian P.; Levinsohn, James.+Stata Journal+2004::no title+WOOLDRIDGE JM+ESTIMATING FIRM LEVE+2005"

Contour-enhanced funnel plots for meta-analysis,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2008,20,67,"Funnel plots are commonly used to investigate publication and related biases in meta-analysis. Although asymmetry in the appearance of a funnel plot is often interpreted as being caused by publication bias, in reality the asymmetry could be due to other factors that cause systematic differences in the results of large and small studies, for example, confounding factors such as differential study quality. Funnel plots can be enhanced by adding contours of statistical significance to aid in interpreting the funnel plot. If studies appear to be missing in areas of low statistical significance, then it is possible that the asymmetry is due to publication bias. If studies appear to be missing in areas of high statistical significance, then publication bias is a less likely cause of the funnel asymmetry. It is proposed that this enhancement to funnel plots should be used routinely for meta-analyses where it is possible that results could be suppressed on the basis of their statistical significance.","gr0033,confunnel,funnel plots,meta-analysis,publication bias,small-study effects","ACUTE MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION,INTRAVENOUS MAGNESIUM,PUBLICATION BIAS,TRIALS","Palmer, Tom M.@Univ Leicester, Dept Hlth Sci, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England::Peters, Jaime L.@Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Math Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia::Sutton, Alex J.@Univ Leicester, Dept Hlth Sci, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England::Moreno, Santiago G.@Univ Leicester, Dept Hlth Sci, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England","Palmer, Tom M.@University of Leicester::Peters, Jaime L.@Queensland University of Technology (QUT)::Sutton, Alex J.@University of Leicester::Moreno, Santiago G.@University of Leicester",not exist,"sbe24: metandan alterna- tive meta- analysis command+Bradburn, MJ; Deeks, JJ; Altman, DG.+Stata Tech Bull+1998::ISIS-4 - A RANDOMIZED FACTORIAL TRIAL ASSESSING EARLY ORAL CAPTOPRIL, ORAL MONONITRATE, AND INTRAVENOUS MAGNESIUM-SULFATE IN 58,050 PATIENTS WITH SUSPECTED ACUTE MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION+COLLINS, R; PETO, R; FLATHER, M; et al.+LANCET+MAR 18 1995::no title+DICKERSIN K+AIDS EDUC PREV+1997::Trim and fill: A simple funnel-plot-based method of testing and adjusting for publication bias in meta-analysis+Duval, S; Tweedie, R+BIOMETRICS+JUN 2000::PUBLICATION BIAS IN CLINICAL RESEARCH+EASTERBROOK, PJ; BERLIN, JA; GOPALAN, R; et al.+LANCET+APR 13 1991::Bias in meta-analysis detected by a simple, graphical test+Egger, M; Smith, GD; Schneider, M; et al.+BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL+SEP 13 1997::The accumulated evidence on lung cancer and environmental tobacco smoke+Hackshaw, AK; Law, MR; Wald, NJ+BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL+OCT 18 1997::no title+HARBORD RM+MODIFIED TEST BIAS M+2003::A modified test for small-study effects in meta-analyses of controlled trials with binary endpoints+Harbord, Roger M.; Egge, Matthias; Sterne, Jonathan A.

Semiparametric analysis of case-control genetic data in the presence of environmental factors,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2008,21,13,"In the past decade, many statistical methods have been proposed for the analysis of case control genetic data with an emphasis on haplotype-based disease association studies. Most of the methodology has concentrated on the estimation of genetic (haplotype) main effects. Most methods accounted for estimation and gene-environment interaction effects by using prospective-type analyses that may lead to biased estimates when used with case control data. Several recent publications addressed the issue of retrospective sampling in the analysis of case-control genetic data in the presence of environmental factors by developing efficient semiparametric statistical methods. This article describes the new Stata command haplologit, which implements efficient profile-likelihood semiparametric methods for fitting gene environment models in the very important special cases of a rare disease, a single candidate gene in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and independence of genetic and environmental factors.","st0148,haplogit,haplotype-based analysis,haplotype-environment independence,case-control data,Hardy Weinberg equilibrium,profile likehilood,retrospective study,single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,HAPLOTYPE INFERENCE,COLORECTAL ADENOMA,ASSOCIATION,PHASE,RISK","Marchenko, Yulia V.@StataCorp, College Stn, TX USA::Carroll, Raymond J.@Texas A&M Univ, Dept Stat, College Stn, TX 77843 USA::Lin, Danyu Y.@Univ N Carolina, Dept Biostat, Chapel Hill, NC USA::Amos, Christopher I.@MD Anderson Canc Res Ctr, Houston, TX USA::Gutierrez, Roberto G.@StataCorp, College Stn, TX USA","Marchenko, Yulia V.@Unknow::Carroll, Raymond J.@Texas A&M University College Station@Texas A&M University System::Lin, Danyu Y.@University of North Carolina@University of North Carolina Chapel Hill::Amos, Christopher I.@UTMD Anderson Cancer Center@University of Texas System::Gutierrez, Roberto G.@Unknow",not exist,"ASYMPTOTIC PROPERTIES OF CONDITIONAL MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATORS+ANDERSEN, EB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1970::On the semi-parametric efficiency of logistic regression under case-control sampling+Breslow, NE; Robins, JM; Wellner, JA+BERNOULLI+JUN 2000::Serniparametric maximum likelihood estimation exploiting gene-environment independence in case-control studies+Chatterjee, N; Carroll, RJ+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 2005::Retrospective analysis of haplotype-based case-control studies under a flexible model for gene-environment association+Chen, Yi-Hau; Chatterjee, Nilanjan; Carroll, Raymond J.+BIOSTATISTICS+JAN 2008::Exploratory analysis of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) for quantitative traits+Cleves, MA+STATA JOURNAL+2005::Inference on haplotype effects in case-control studies using unphased genotype data+Epstein, MP; Satten, GA+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS+DEC 2003::The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial of the National Cancer Institute: History, organization, and status+Gohagan, JK; Prorok, PC; Hayes, RB; et al.+CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS+DEC 2000::Estimation and tests of haplotype-environment interaction when linkage phase is ambiguous+Lake, SL; Lyon, H; Tantisira, K; et al.+HUMAN HEREDITY+2003::Maximum likelihood estimation of haplotype effects and haplotype-environment interactions in association studies+Lin, DY; Zeng, D; Millikan, R+GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY+DEC 2005::Likelihood-based inference on haplotype effects in genetic association studies+Lin, DY; Zeng, D+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2006::no title+LOBACH L+BIOMETRICS+no time::no title+MANDER AP+STATA J+2001::Cigarette smoking, N-acetyltransferase genes and the risk of advanced colorectal adenoma+Moslehi, Roxana; Chatterjee, Nilanjan; Church, Timothy R.; et al.+PHARMACOGENOMICS+SEP 2006::Bayesian haplotype inference for multiple linked single-nucleotide polymorphisms+Niu, TH; Qin, ZHS; Xu, XP; et al.+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS+JAN 2002::Association of genetic variants in the calcium-sensing receptor with risk of colorectal adenoma+Peters, U; Chatterjee, N; Yeager, M; et al.+CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY BIOMARKERS &amp; PREVENTION+DEC 2004::LOGISTIC DISEASE INCIDENCE MODELS AND CASE-CONTROL STUDIES+PRENTICE, RL; PYKE, R+BIOMETRIKA+1979::Comparison of prospective and retrospective methods for haplotype inference in case-control studies+Satten, GA; Epstein, MP+GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY+NOV 2004::Analysis of case-control studies of genetic and environmental factors with missing genetic information and haplotype-phase ambiguity+Spinka, C; Carroll, RJ; Chatterjee, N+GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY+SEP 2005::no title+Weir, BS.+Genetic data analysis+1996::A method for the assessment of disease associations with single-nucleotide polymorphism haplotypes and environmental variables in case-control studies+Zhao, LP; Li, SYS; Khalid, N+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS+MAY 2003::no title+no author+STATA J+2002"

The Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition for linear regression models,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2008,48,339,"The counterfactual decomposition technique popularized by Blinder (1973, Journal of Human Resources, 436-455) and Oaxaca (1973, International Economic Review, 693-709) is widely used to study mean outcome differences between groups. For example, the technique is often used to analyze wage gaps by sex or race. This article summarizes the technique and addresses several complications, such as the identification of effects of categorical predictors in the detailed decomposition or the estimation of standard errors.

A closer examination of subpopulation analysis of complex-sample survey data,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2008,25,43,"In recent years, general-purpose statistical software packages have incorporated new procedures that feature several useful options for design-based analysis of complex-sample Survey data. A common and frequently desired technique for analysis of survey data in practice is the restriction of estimation to a subpopulation of interest. These subpopulations are often referred to interchangeably in a variety of fields as subclasses, subgroups, and domains. In this article, we consider two approaches that analysts of complex-sample survey data call follow when analyzing subpopulations; we also consider the implications of each approach for estimation and inference. We then present examples of both approaches, using selected procedures in Stata to analyze data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS). We conclude with important considerations for subpopulation analyses and a summary of suggestions for practice.","st0153,survey data analysis,statistical software,complex sample designs,subpopulation analysis",,"West, Brady T.@Univ Michigan, Ctr Stat Consultat & Res, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA::Berglund, Patricia@Univ Michigan, Inst Social Res, Survey Methodol Program, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA::Heeringa, Steven G.@Univ Michigan, Inst Social Res, Survey Methodol Program, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA@Univ Michigan, Inst Social Res, Stat & Res Design Grp, Survey Res Ctr, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA@Univ Michigan, Inst Social Res, Summer Inst Survey Res Tech, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","West, Brady T.@University of Michigan@University of Michigan System::Berglund, Patricia@University of Michigan@University of Michigan System::Heeringa, Steven G.@University of Michigan@University of Michigan System",not exist,"no title+BURNS AM+P SURV RES METH SECT+2003::no title+BURT CW+VITAL HLTH STAT+2004::no title+Cochran, WG.+Sampling Techniques+1977::Estimates of linear combinations and hypothesis tests for survey data+Eltinge, J.

A shortcut through long loops: An illustration of two alternatives to looping over observations,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2008,1,0,"It is well known that looping over observations can be slow and should be avoided. The objective of this article is to discuss two alternative solutions to looping over observations that can be used to overcome a particular data-management problem of merging datasets in which unique key identifiers changed over time. The first alternative, mapch, which is introduced in this article, uses a combination of appending, indexing, and merging to solve the problem, while the second alternative uses repeated merging. Both solutions are much quicker than looping over observations. However, depending on the nature of the problem, one solution may work better than the other. It is argued that the use of such dataset-type manipulations may be suitable to overcome other data-management problems.

Multivariable modeling with cubic regression splines: A principled approach,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2007,18,118,"Spline functions provide a useful and flexible basis for modeling relationships with continuous predictors. However, to limit instability and provide sensible regression models in the multivariable setting, a principled approach to model selection and function estimation is important. Here the multivariable fractional polynomials approach to model building is transferred to regression splines. The essential features are specifying a maximum acceptable complexity for each continuous function and applying a closed-test approach to each continuous predictor to simplify the model where possible. Important adjuncts are an initial choice of scale for continuous predictors (linear or logarithmic), which often helps one to generate realistic, parsimonious final models; a goodness-of-fit test for a parametric function of a predictor; and a preliminary predictor transformation to improve robustness.","st0120,mvrs,uvrs,splinegen,multivariable analysis,continuous predictor,regression spline,model building,goodness of fit,choice of scale","FRACTIONAL POLYNOMIALS,EPIDEMIOLOGY,VARIABLES,SELECTION","Royston, Patrick@UK MRC, London, England@Univ Med Ctr, Freiburg, Germany::Sauerbrei, Willi@UK MRC, London, England@Univ Med Ctr, Freiburg, Germany","Royston, Patrick@Unknow@University of Freiburg::Sauerbrei, Willi@Unknow@University of Freiburg",not exist,"no title+Green, P.

Sensitivity analysis for average treatment effects,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2007,19,170,"Based on the conditional independence or unconfoundedness assumption, matching has become a popular approach to estimate average treatment effects. Checking the sensitivity of the estimated results with respect to deviations from this identifying assumption has become an increasingly important topic in the applied evaluation literature. If there are unobserved variables that affect assignment into treatment and the outcome variable simultaneously, a, hidden bias might arise to which matching estimators are not robust. We address this problem with the bounding approach proposed by Rosenbaum (Observational Studies, 2nd ed., New York: Springer), where mhbounds lets the researcher determine how strongly an unmeasured variable must influence the selection process to undermine the implications of the matching analysis.","st0121,mhbounds,matching,treatment effects,sensitivity analysis,unobserved heterogeneity,Rosenbaum bounds","TRAINING-PROGRAMS,ESTIMATORS,BOUNDS,BIAS","Becker, Sascha O.@Univ Munich, Ctr Econ Studies, Munich, Germany@German Inst Econ Res DIW, Berlin, Germany::Caliendo, Marco@Univ Munich, Ctr Econ Studies, Munich, Germany@German Inst Econ Res DIW, Berlin, Germany","Becker, Sascha O.@Ifo Institut@University of Munich@DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung::Caliendo, Marco@Ifo Institut@University of Munich@DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung","Becker, Sascha O.@B-2463-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0672-4865","Bounding a matching estimator: the case of a Norwegian training program+Aakvik, A+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+FEB 2001::Implementing matching estimators for average treatment effects in Stata+Abadie, A.; Drukker, D.; Herr, J.

Improved generalized estimating equation analysis via xtqls for quasi-least squares in Stata,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2007,18,46,"Quasi-least squares (QLS) is an alternative method for estimating the correlation parameters within the framework of the generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach for analyzing correlated cross-sectional and longitudinal data. This article summarizes the development of QLS that occurred in several reports and describes its use with the user-written program xtqls in Stata. Also, it demonstrates the following advantages of QLS: (1) QLS allows some correlation structures that have not yet been implemented in the framework of GEE, (2) QLS can be applied as an alternative to GEE if the GEE estimate is infeasible, and (3) QLS uses the same estimating equation for estimation of beta as GEE; as a result, QLS can involve programs already available for GEE. In particular, xtqls calls the Stata program xtgee within an iterative approach that alternates between updating estimates of the correlation parameter a and then using xtgee to solve the GEE for beta at the current estimate of a. The benefit of this approach is that after xtqls, all the usual postregression estimation commands are readily available to the user.","st0122,xtqls,correlated data,clustered data,longitudinal data,generalized estimating equations,quasi-least squares","LONGITUDINAL DATA,LINEAR-MODELS,FRAMEWORK","Shults, Justine@Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Biostat & Epidemiol, Ctr Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA::Ratcliffe, Sarah J.@Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Biostat & Epidemiol, Ctr Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA::Leonard, Mary@Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Biostat & Epidemiol, Ctr Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Shults, Justine@University of Pennsylvania::Ratcliffe, Sarah J.@University of Pennsylvania::Leonard, Mary@University of Pennsylvania",not exist,"On elimination the asymptotic bias in the quasi-least squares estimate of the correlation parameter+Chaganty, N R; Shults, J.+J Statist Plann Inference+1999::An alternative approach to the analysis of longitudinal data via generalized estimating equations+Chaganty, NR+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+SEP 30 1997::ON THE USE OF A WORKING CORRELATION MATRIX IN USING GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS FOR REPEATED-MEASURES+CROWDER, M+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1995::no title+DIGGLE P+ANAL LONGTIDUNAL DAT+2002::no title+Hardin, JW.+Generalized estimating equations+2003::LONGITUDINAL DATA-ANALYSIS USING GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS+LIANG, KY; ZEGER, SL+BIOMETRIKA+APR 1986::no title+Newton, HJ.+Timeslab: a time series analysis laboratory+1988::CORRELATED BINARY REGRESSION WITH COVARIATES SPECIFIC TO EACH BINARY OBSERVATION+PRENTICE, RL+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1988::no title+SHULTS J+BIOLATION BOUNDS COR+2006::Use of quasi-least squares to adjust for two levels of correlation+Shults, J; Morrow, AL+BIOMETRICS+SEP 2002::Analysis of serially correlated data using quasi-least squares+Shults, J+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1998::Analysis of data with multiple sources of correlation in the framework of generalized estimating equations+Shults, J; Whitt, MC; Kumanyika, S+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+OCT 30 2004::no title+SHULTS J+THESIS OLD DOMINION+1996::Analysis of repeated bouts of measurements in the framework of generalized estimating equations+Shults, Justine; Mazurick, Carissa A.; Landis, J.

Two postestimation commands for assessing confounding effects in epidemiological studies,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2007,14,10,"Confounding is a major issue in observational epidemiological studies. This paper describes two postestimation commands for assessing confounding effects. One command (confall) displays and plots all possible effect estimates against one of p-value, Akaike information criterion, or Bayesian information criterion. This computing-intensive procedure allows researchers to inspect the variability of the effect estimates from various possible models. Another command (chest) uses a step-wise approach to identify variables that have substantially changed the effect estimate. Both commands can be used after most common estimation commands in epidemiological studies, such as logistic regression, conditional logistic regression, Poisson regression, linear regression, and Cox proportional hazards models.","st0124,confall,confgr,chest,epidemiological methods,confounding,all possible effects,change in estimate",MODEL,"Wang, Zhiqiang@Univ Queensland, Sch Med, Brisbane, Qld, Australia@Univ Queensland, Sch Populat Hlth, Brisbane, Qld, Australia","Wang, Zhiqiang@University of Queensland@University of Queensland","Wang, Zhiqiang@A-5835-2010","NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::ADJUSTING FOR CONFOUNDING WITH STATISTICAL SOFTWARE PACKAGES+DEBANNE, SM; SOKOL, RJ+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PERINATOLOGY+APR 1986::CONFOUNDING CONFOUNDING+GRAYSON, DA+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+SEP 1987::CONFOUNDING AND MISCLASSIFICATION+GREENLAND, S; ROBINS, JM+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+1985::IDENTIFIABILITY, EXCHANGEABILITY, AND EPIDEMIOLOGIC CONFOUNDING+GREENLAND, S; ROBINS, JM+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+SEP 1986::no title+KLEINBAUM DG+EPIDEMIOGIC RES PRIN+1982::CONFOUNDING AND EFFECT-MODIFICATION+MIETTINEN, O+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+1974::no title+Rothman, K.; Greenland, S.+Modern epidemiology+1998::ASSESSING EFFECTS OF CONFOUNDING VARIABLES+SCHLESSELMAN, JJ+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+1978::Control for confounding in the presence of measurement error in hierarchical models+Schwartz, J; Coull, BA+BIOSTATISTICS+OCT 2003::ESTIMATING DIMENSION OF A MODEL+SCHWARZ, G+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1978::Adjusting effect estimates for unmeasured confounding with validation data using propensity score calibration+Sturmer, T; Schneeweiss, S; Avorn, J; et al.+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+AUG 1 2005::no title+WANG Z+STATS TECHNICAL B+2000::TOWARD A CLEARER DEFINITION OF CONFOUNDING+WEINBERG, CR+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+JAN 1 1993"

In such situations, researchers are accustomed to making inferences by using exact statistics. The ranksum and signrank commands in Stata provide only asymptotic results, which assume normality. Because large-sample results are unacceptable in many clinical trials studies, these researchers must use other software packages. To address this, we have developed new commands for Stata that provide exact statistics in small samples. Additionally, when samples are large, we provide results based on the Student's t distribution that outperform those based on the normal distribution.","st0297,ranksumex,signrankex,exact distributions,nonparametric tests,median,Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test,Wilcoxon ranksum test",CONTINGENCY-TABLES,"Harris, Tammy@Univ S Carolina, Inst Families Soc, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Columbia, SC 29208 USA::Hardin, James W.@Univ S Carolina, Inst Families Soc, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Columbia, SC 29208 USA","Harris, Tammy@University of South Carolina Columbia@University of South Carolina@University of South Carolina System::Hardin, James W.@University of South Carolina Columbia@University of South Carolina@University of South Carolina System","Hardin, James@Q-7617-2016@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0506-5500","A survey of exact inference for Contingency Tables+Agresti, A.+Statistical Science+1992::Different outcomes of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test from different statistics packages+Bergmann, R; Ludbrook, J; Spooren, WPJM+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+FEB 2000::no title+Conover, W.

Goodness-of-fit tests for categorical data,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2013,6,0,"A significant aspect of data modeling with categorical predictors is the definition of a saturated model. In fact, there are different ways of specifying it the casewise, the contingency table, and the collapsing approaches and they strictly depend on the unit of analysis considered.

The analytical units of reference could be the subjects or, alternatively, groups of subjects that have the same covariate pattern. In the first case, the goal is to predict the probability of success (failure) for each individual; in the second case, the goal is to predict the proportion of successes (failures) in each group. The analytical unit adopted does not affect the estimation process; however, it does affect the definition of a saturated model. Consequently, measures and tests of goodness of fit can lead to different results and interpretations. Thus one must carefully consider which approach to choose.

In this article, we focus on the deviance test for logistic regression models. However, the results and the conclusions are easily applicable to other linear models involving categorical regressors.

We show how Stata 12.1 performs when implementing goodness of fit. In this situation, it is important to clarify which one of the three approaches is implemented as default. Furthermore, a prominent role is played by the shape of the dataset considered (individual format or events trials format) in accordance with the analytical unit choice. In fact, the same procedure applied to different data structures leads to different approaches to a saturated model. Thus one must attend to practical and theoretical statistical issues to avoid inappropriate analyses.","st0299,saturated models,categorical data,deviance,goodness-of-fit tests",LOGISTIC-REGRESSION,"Bellocco, Rino@Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Stat & Quantitat Methods, Milan, Italy@Karolinska Inst, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Stockholm, Sweden::Algeri, Sara@Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX USA","Bellocco, Rino@University of Milano-Bicocca@Karolinska Institutet::Algeri, Sara@Texas A&M University College Station@Texas A&M University System","Bellocco, Rino@E-7674-2018","no title+Agresti, A.+An introduction to categorical data analysis+2007::Causal diagrams for epidemiologic research+Greenland, S; Pearl, J; Robins, JM+EPIDEMIOLOGY+JAN 1999::A comparison of goodness-of-fit tests for the logistic regression model+Hosmer, DW; Hosmer, T; leCessie, S; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+MAY 15 1997::no title+Kleinbaum,, D.

In this article, we demonstrate with two examples how to implement quantitative thought experiments in Stata. The first example uses a large-sample approach to study the impact on the estimated effect size of dichotomizing an exposure variable at different values. The second example uses simulations of datasets of realistic size to illustrate the necessity of using sampling fractions as inverse probability weights in statistical analysis for protection against bias in a complex sampling design. We also give a brief outline of the general steps needed for implementing quantitative thought experiments in Stata.

Sar: Automatic generation of statistical reports using Stata and Microsoft Word for Windows,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2013,10,2,"The output provided by most Stata commands is plain text not suitable to be presented or published. After the numerical and graphical outputs are obtained, the user has to copy them into a word processor to complete the editing process.

Stata automatic report (Sar) is an easy-to-use macro for Microsoft Word for Windows that allows a powerful integration between Stata and Word. With Sar, the user can retrieve numerical results and graphs from Stata and automatically insert them into a well-formatted Word document, exploiting all the functions of Word. This process is managed by Word while Stata is executed in the background. Sar requires Stata commands and some specific Sar commands to be written in ordinary Word comments. Thus the report is well documented, and this can encourage the sharing of the workflow of data analysis and the reproducibility of the research. With Sar, the user can create an automatic report, that is, a Word document that can be automatically updated if data have changed.

When the number of clusters available is insufficient to detect the required difference at the prespecified power, clustersampsi will return the minimum number of clusters required under the prespecified design along with the minimum detectable difference and maximum achievable power (both for the prespecified number of clusters). Cluster heterogeneity can be parameterized by using either the intracluster correlation or the coefficient of variation.

Two-stage nonparametric bootstrap sampling with shrinkage correction for clustered data,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2013,23,6,"This article describes a new Stata command, tsb, for performing a stratified two-stage nonparametric bootstrap resampling procedure for clustered data. Estimates for uncertainty around the point estimate, such as standard error and confidence intervals, are derived from the resultant bootstrap samples. A shrinkage estimator proposed for correcting possible overestimation due to second-stage sampling is implemented as default.

Joint modeling of longitudinal and survival data,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2013,17,29,"The joint modeling of longitudinal and survival data has received remarkable attention in the methodological literature over the past decade; however, the availability of software to implement the methods lags behind. The most common form of joint model assumes that the association between the survival and the longitudinal processes is underlined by shared random effects. As a result, computationally intensive numerical integration techniques such as adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature are required to evaluate the likelihood. We describe a new user-written command, stjm, that allows the user to jointly model a continuous longitudinal response and the time to an event of interest. We assume a linear mixed-effects model for the longitudinal submodel, allowing flexibility through the use of fixed or random fractional polynomials of time. Four choices are available for the survival submodel: the exponential, Weibull or Gompertz proportional hazard models, and the flexible parametric model (stpm2). Flexible parametric models are fit on the log cumulative-hazard scale, which has direct computational benefits because it avoids the use of numerical integration to evaluate the cumulative hazard. We describe the features of stjm through application to a dataset investigating the effect of serum bilirubin level on time to death from any cause in 312 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.","st0289,stjm,stjmgraph,stjm postestimation,joint modeling,mixed effects,survival analysis,longitudinal data,adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature",,"Crowther, Michael J.@Univ Leicester, Dept Hlth Sci, Leicester, Leics, England::Abrams, Keith R.@Univ Leicester, Dept Hlth Sci, Leicester, Leics, England::Lambert, Paul C.@Univ Leicester, Dept Hlth Sci, Leicester, Leics, England@Karolinska Inst, Dept Med Epidemiol & Biostat, Stockholm, Sweden","Crowther, Michael J.@University of Leicester::Abrams, Keith R.@University of Leicester::Lambert, Paul C.@University of Leicester@Karolinska Institutet","Abrams, Keith@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7557-1567::Crowther, Michael@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8378-8259","Simultaneous analysis of quality of life and survival data+Billingham, LJ; Abrams, KR+STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH+FEB 2002::Flexible parametric joint modelling of longitudinal and survival data+Crowther, Michael J.; Abrams, Keith R.; Lambert, Paul C.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+DEC 30 2012::FLEXIBLE REGRESSION-MODELS WITH CUBIC-SPLINES+DURRLEMAN, S; SIMON, R+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+MAY 1989::no title+Gould, W.; Pitblado, J.; Poi, W.+Maximum Likelihood Estimation with Stata+2010::Separate and joint modeling of longitudinal and event time data using standard computer packages+Guo, X; Carlin, BP+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+FEB 2004::Joint modelling of longitudinal measurements and event time data.+Henderson, R; Diggle, P; Dobson, A+Biostatistics (Oxford, England)+2000-Dec::Basic Concepts and Methods for Joint Models of Longitudinal and Survival Data+Ibrahim, Joseph G.; Chu, Haitao; Chen, Liddy M.+JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY+JUN 1 2010::Further development of flexible parametric models for survival analysis+Lambert, Paul C.; Royston, Patrick+STATA JOURNAL+2009::PRIMARY BILIARY-CIRRHOSIS - PREDICTION OF SHORT-TERM SURVIVAL BASED ON REPEATED PATIENT VISITS+MURTAUGH, PA; DICKSON, ER; VANDAM, GM; et al.+HEPATOLOGY+JUL 1994::Analyzing longitudinal data in the presence of informative drop-out: The jmre1 command+Pantazis, Nikos; Touloumi, Giota+STATA JOURNAL+2010::Approximations to the log-likelihood function-in the nonlinear mixed-effects model+Pinheiro, Jose C; Bates, Douglas M.+Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics+1995::Reliable estimation of generalised linear mixed models using adaptive quadrature+Rabe-Hesketh, S; Skrondal, A; Pickles, A.+Stara J+2002::Dynamic Predictions and Prospective Accuracy in Joint Models for Longitudinal and Time-to-Event Data+Rizopoulos, Dimitris+BIOMETRICS+SEP 2011::Multiple-Imputation-Based Residuals and Diagnostic Plots for Joint Models of Longitudinal and Survival Outcomes+Rizopoulos, Dimitris; Verbeke, Geert; Molenberghs, Geert+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2010::REGRESSION USING FRACTIONAL POLYNOMIALS OF CONTINUOUS COVARIATES - PARSIMONIOUS PARAMETRIC MODELING+ROYSTON, P; ALTMAN, DG+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+1994::Flexible parametric proportional-hazards and proportional-odds models for censored survival data, with application to prognostic modelling and estimation of treatment effects+Royston, P; Parmar, MKB+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+AUG 15 2002::A joint model for survival and longitudinal data measured with error+Wulfsohn, MS; Tsiatis, AA+BIOMETRICS+MAR 1997"
Doubly robust estimation in generalized linear models,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2013,12,4,"A common aim of epidemiological research is to assess the association between a particular exposure and a particular outcome, controlling for a set of additional covariates. This is often done by using a regression model for the outcome, conditional on exposure and covariates. A commonly used class of models is the generalized linear models. The model parameters are typically estimated through maximum likelihood. If the model is correct, then the maximum likelihood estimator is consistent but may otherwise be inconsistent. Recently, a new class of estimators known as doubly robust estimators has been proposed. These estimators use two regression models, one for the outcome and one for the exposure, and are consistent if either model is correct, not necessarily both. Thus doubly robust estimators give the analyst two chances instead of only one to make valid inference. In this article, we describe a new Stata command, drglm, that implements the most common doubly robust estimators for generalized linear models.","st0290,drglm,doubly robust,generalized linear model",MISSING DATA,"Orsini, Nicola@Karolinska Inst, Inst Environm Med, Unit Biostat, S-10401 Stockholm, Sweden@Karolinska Inst, Inst Environm Med, Unit Nutr Epidemiol, S-10401 Stockholm, Sweden::Bellocco, Rino@Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Stat & Quantitat Methods, Milan, Italy@Karolinska Inst, Dept Med Epidemiol & Biostat, Stockholm, Sweden::Sjolander, Arvid@Karolinska Inst, Dept Med Epidemiol & Biostat, Stockholm, Sweden","Orsini, Nicola@Karolinska Institutet::Bellocco, Rino@University of Milano-Bicocca@Karolinska Institutet::Sjolander, Arvid@Karolinska Institutet","Bellocco, Rino@E-7674-2018","Doubly robust estimation in missing data and causal inference models+Bang, H+BIOMETRICS+DEC 2005::Effects of physical activity, body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio and waist circumference on total mortality risk in the Swedish National March Cohort+Bellocco, Rino; Jia, Chongqi; Ye, Weimin; et al.+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+NOV 2010::Semiparametric estimation of treatment effect in a pretest-posttest study with missing data+Davidian, M; Tsiatis, AA; Leon, S+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+AUG 2005::Implementing double-robust estimators of causal effects+Emsley, Richard; Lunt, Mark; Pickles, Andrew; et al.+STATA JOURNAL+2008::Demystifying double robustness: A comparison of alternative strategies for estimating a population mean from incomplete data+Kang, Joseph D.

From resultssets to resultstables in Stata,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2012,11,3,"The listtab package supersedes the listtex package. It inputs a list of variables and outputs them as a table in one of several formats, including TEX, LATEX, HTML, Microsoft Rich Text Format, or possibly future XML-based formats. It works with a team of four other packages: sdecode, chardef, xrewide, and ingap, which are downloaded from the Statistical Software Components archive. The sdecode package is an extension of decode; it allows the user to add prefixes or suffixes and to output exponents as TEX, HTML, or Rich Text Format superscripts. It is called by another package, bmjcip, to convert estimates, confidence limits, and p-values from numeric to string. The chardef package is an extension of char define; it allows the user to define a characteristic for a list of variables, adding prefixes or suffixes. The xrewide package is an extension of reshape wide; it allows the user to store additional results in variable characteristics or local macros. The ingap package inserts gap observations into a dataset to form gap rows when the dataset is converted to a table. Together, these packages form a general toolkit to convert Stata datasets (or resultssets) to tables, complete with row labels and column labels. Examples are demonstrated using LATEX and also using the rtfutil package to create Rich Text Format documents.

A generalized missing-indicator approach to regression with imputed covariates,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2012,19,4,"We consider estimation of a linear regression model using data where some covariate values are missing but imputations are available to fill in the missing values. This situation generates a tradeoff between bias and precision when estimating the regression parameters of interest. Using only the subsample of complete observations does not cause bias but may imply a substantial loss of precision because the complete cases may be too few. On the other hand, filling in the missing values with imputations may cause bias. We provide the new Stata command gmi, which handles such tradeoff by using either model reduction or Bayesian model averaging techniques in the context of the generalized missing-indicator approach recently proposed by Dardanoni, Modica, and Peracchi (2011, Journal of Econometrics 162: 362-368). If multiple imputations are available, gmi can also be combined with the built-in Stata prefix mi estimate to account for extra variability due to imputation. We illustrate the use of gmi with an empirical application in the health domain, where item nonresponse is substantial.","st0273,gmi,missing covariates,imputation,bias-precision tradeoff,model reduction,model averaging","LINEAR-REGRESSION,IMPUTATION","Dardanoni, Valentino@Univ Palermo, Palermo, Italy::De Luca, Giuseppe@Univ Palermo, Palermo, Italy::Modica, Salvatore@Univ Palermo, Palermo, Italy::Peracchi, Franco@Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy@EIEF, Rome, Italy","Dardanoni, Valentino@University of Palermo - Italy::De Luca, Giuseppe@University of Palermo - Italy::Modica, Salvatore@University of Palermo - Italy::Peracchi, Franco@University of Rome Tor Vergata","Peracchi, F@H-2645-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4532-6173","Cross-national differences in grip strength among 50+year-old Europeans: results from the SHARE study+Andersen-Ranberg, Karen; Petersen, I.; Frederiksen, H.; et al.+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGEING+SEP 2009::no title+no author+Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe - First Results from the survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe+2005::Imputation of missing data in waves 1 and 2 of SHARE+Christelis, D.+Working Paper 01-2011+2010::Regression with imputed covariates: A generalized missing-indicator approach+Dardanoni, Valentino; Modica, Salvatore; Peracchi, Franco+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUN 2011::Bayesian model averaging and weighted-average least squares: Equivariance, stability, and numerical issues+De Luca, Giuseppe; Magnus, Jan R.+STATA JOURNAL+2011::Much ado about nothing: A comparison of missing data methods and software to fit incomplete data regression models+Horton, Nicholas J.; Kleinman, Ken P.+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+FEB 2007::Indicator and stratification methods for missing explanatory variables in multiple linear regression+Jones, MP+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1996::no title+Kumar, K.; Magnus, J.

Graphical augmentations to the funnel plot to assess the impact of a new study on an existing meta-analysis,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2012,12,6,"Funnel plots are currently advocated to investigate the presence of publication bias (and other possible sources of bias) in meta-analysis. A previously described augmentation to the funnel plot to aid its interpretation in assessing publication biases is the addition of statistical contours indicating regions where studies would have to be for a given level of significance, as implemented in the Stata package confunnel by Palmer et al. (2008, Stata Journal 8: 242-254).

In this article, we describe the implementation of a new range of overlay augmentations to the funnel plot, many described in detail recently by Langan et al. (2012, Journal of Clinical Epidemiology 65: 511-519). The purpose of these overlays is to display the potential impact a new study would have on an existing meta-analysis, providing an indication of the robustness of the meta-analysis to the addition of new evidence. Thus these overlays extend the use of the funnel plot beyond assessments of publication biases. Two main graphical displays are described: 1) statistical significance contours, which define regions of the funnel plot where a new study would have to be located to change the statistical significance of the meta-analysis; and 2) heterogeneity contours, which show how a new study would affect the extent of heterogeneity in a given meta-analysis.

We present the extfunnel command, which implements the methods of Langan et al. (2012, Journal of Clinical Epidemiology 65: 511-519), and, furthermore, we extend the graphical displays to illustrate the impact a new study has on lower and upper confidence interval values and the confidence interval width of the pooled meta-analytic result. We also describe overlays for the impact of a future study on user-defined limits of clinical equivalence. We implement inverse-variance weighted methods by using both explicit formulas for contour lines and a simulation approach optimized in Mata.","gr0054,extfunnel,funnel plots,meta-analysis,graphs",TRIAL,"Crowther, Michael J.@Univ Leicester, Dept Hlth Sci, Leicester, Leics, England::Langan, Dean@Univ Leeds, Clin Trials Res Unit CTRU, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England::Sutton, Alex J.@Univ Leicester, Dept Hlth Sci, Leicester, Leics, England","Crowther, Michael J.@University of Leicester::Langan, Dean@University of Leeds::Sutton, Alex J.@University of Leicester","Crowther, Michael@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8378-8259","Graphical displays for meta-analysis: An overview with suggestions for practice+Anzures-Cabrera, Judith; Higgins, Julian P.

Fitting and modeling cure in population-based cancer studies within the framework of flexible parametric survival models,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2012,15,3,"When the mortality among a cancer patient group returns to the same level as in the general population, that is, when the patients no longer experience excess mortality, the patients still alive are considered ""statistically cured"". Cure models can be used to estimate the cure proportion as well as the survival function of the ""uncured"". One limitation of parametric cure models is that the functional form of the survival of the uncured has to be specified. It can sometimes be hard to find a survival function flexible enough to fit the observed data, for example, when there is high excess hazard within a few months from diagnosis, which is common among older age groups. This has led to the exclusion of older age groups in population-based cancer studies using cure models. Here we use flexible parametric survival models that incorporate cure as a special case to estimate the cure proportion and the survival of the uncured. Flexible parametric survival models use splines to model the underlying hazard function; therefore, no parametric distribution has to be specified. We have updated the stpm2 command for flexible parametric models to enable cure modeling.","st0165_1,stpm2,stpm2 postestimation,cure models,flexible parametric,survival model,relative survival,survival analysis","FRACTION,TRENDS,COLON","Andersson, Therese M. -L.@Karolinska Inst, Dept Med Epidemiol & Biostat, Stockholm, Sweden::Lambert, Paul C.@Karolinska Inst, Dept Med Epidemiol & Biostat, Stockholm, Sweden@Univ Leicester, Dept Hlth Sci, Leicester, Leics, England","Andersson, Therese M. -L.@Karolinska Institutet::Lambert, Paul C.@University of Leicester@Karolinska Institutet","Andersson, Therese@E-7107-2016@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8644-9041","Estimating and modelling cure in population-based cancer studies within the framework of flexible parametric survival models+Andersson, Therese M.

Tools to simulate realistic censored survival-time distributions,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2012,8,5,"Simulation of realistic censored survival times is challenging. Most research studies use highly simplified models, such as the exponential, that do not adequately reflect the patterns of time to event and censoring seen in real datasets. In this article, I present a general method of simulating such data based on flexible parametric survival models (Royston and Parmar, 2002, Statistics in Medicine 21: 2175-2197). A key component of the approach is modeling not only the time to event but also the time to censoring. I illustrate the methods in data from clinical trials and from a prognostic study.

Simulating complex survival data,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2012,10,7,"Simulation studies are essential for understanding and evaluating both current and new statistical models. When simulating survival times, one often assumes an exponential or Weibull distribution for the baseline hazard function, with survival times generated using the method of Bender, Augustin, and Blettner (2005, Statistics in Medicine 24: 1713-1723). Assuming a constant or monotonic hazard can be considered too simplistic and can lack biological plausibility in many situations. We describe a new user-written command, survsim, which allows the user to simulate survival times from two-component parametric mixture models, providing much more flexibility in the underlying hazard. Standard parametric distributions can also be used, including the exponential, Weibull, and Gompertz. Furthermore, survival times can be simulated from the all-cause distribution of cause-specific hazards for competing risks by using the method of Beyersmann et al. (2009, Statistics in Medicine 24: 956-971). A multinomial distribution is used to create the event indicator, whereby the probability of experiencing each event at a simulated time t is the cause-specific hazard divided by the all-cause hazard evaluated at time t. Baseline covariates can be included in all scenarios. We also describe the extension to incorporate nonproportional hazards in standard parametric and competing-risks scenarios.","st0275,survsim,simulation,survival analysis,mixture models,competing risks","PROPORTIONAL-HAZARDS,COMPETING RISKS,MODELS","Crowther, Michael J.@Univ Leicester, Dept Hlth Sci, Leicester, Leics, England::Lambert, Paul C.@Univ Leicester, Dept Hlth Sci, Leicester, Leics, England@Karolinska Inst, Dept Med Epidemiol & Biostat, Stockholm, Sweden","Crowther, Michael J.@University of Leicester::Lambert, Paul C.@University of Leicester@Karolinska Institutet","Crowther, Michael@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8378-8259","Generating survival times to simulate Cox proportional hazards models+Bender, R; Augustin, T; Blettner, M+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUN 15 2005::Simulating competing risks data in survival analysis+Beyersmann, Jan; Latouche, Aurelien; Buchholz, Anika; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+MAR 15 2009::The design of simulation studies in medical statistics+Burton, Andrea; Altman, Douglas G.; Royston, Patrick; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+DEC 30 2006::Cumulative incidence estimation in the presence of competing risks+Coviello, V.; Boggess, M.+Stata Journal+2004::REGRESSION MODELS AND LIFE-TABLES+COX, DR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1972::no title+Crowther, MJ; Lambert, PC.+STMIX: Stata Module to Fit Two-Component Parametric Mixture Survival Models, Statistical Software Components+2011::On the role of finite mixture models in survival analysis.+McLachlan, G J; McGiffin, D C+Statistical methods in medical research+1994::Tutorial in biostatistics: Competing risks and multi-state models+Putter, H.; Fiocco, M.; Geskus, R.

Incorporating complex sample design effects when only final survey weights are available,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2012,16,10,"In this article, we consider the situation that arises when a survey data producer has collected data from a sample with a complex design (possibly featuring stratification of the population, cluster sampling, and unequal probabilities of selection) and for various reasons only provides secondary analysts of those survey data with a final survey weight for each respondent and ""average"" design effects for survey estimates computed from the data. In general, these ""average"" design effects, presumably computed by the data producer in a way that fully accounts for all the complex sampling features, already incorporate possible increases in sampling variance due to the use of the survey weights in estimation. The secondary analyst of the survey data-who uses the provided information to compute weighted estimates; computes design-based standard errors reflecting variance in the weights (by using Taylor series linearization, for example); and inflates the estimated variances using the ""average"" design effects provided-is applying a ""double"" adjustment to the standard errors for the effect of weighting on the variance estimates, leading to overly conservative inferences. We propose a simple method to prevent this problem and provide a Stata program for applying appropriate adjustments to variance estimates in this situation. We illustrate two applications of the method with survey data from the Monitoring the Future study and conclude with suggested directions for future research in this area.","st0277,deft2corr,survey design effects,survey weights,average design effects",PRESCRIPTION NARCOTIC-ABUSE,"West, Brady T.@Univ Michigan, Inst Social Res, Survey Res Ctr, Survey Methodol Program, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA::McCabe, Sean Esteban@Univ Michigan, Subst Abuse Res Ctr, Inst Res Women & Gender, Ann Arbor, MI USA","West, Brady T.@University of Michigan@University of Michigan System::McCabe, Sean Esteban@University of Michigan@University of Michigan System","McCabe, Sean@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9622-4652","Design effects and survey planning+Clark, J.; Rust, K.; Sedlak, A.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Morganstein, D.; Park, I.; Winglee, M</span>.+P SURV RES METH SECT+2003::no title+Heeringa, S.; West, B.

A review of Stata commands for fixed-effects estimation in normal linear models,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2012,13,14,"Availability of large multilevel longitudinal databases in various fields of research, including labor economics (with workers and firms observed over time) and education (with students, teachers, and schools observed over time), has increased the application of models with one level or multiple levels of fixed effects (for example, teacher and student effects). There has been a corresponding rapid development of Stata commands designed for fitting these types of models. The commands parameterize the fixed-effects portions of models differently. In cases where estimates of the fixed-effects parameters are of interest, it is critical to understand precisely what parameters are being estimated by different commands. In this article, we catalog the estimates of reported fixed effects provided by different commands for several canonical cases of both one-level and two-level fixed-effects models.

Partial frontier efficiency analysis,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2012,12,8,"Despite their frequent use in applied work, nonparametric approaches to efficiency analysis-namely, data envelopment analysis and free disposal hull-have had reputations among econometricians. This is mainly because data envelopment analysis and free disposal hull represent deterministic approaches that are highly sensitive to outliers and measurement errors. However, so-called partial frontier approaches have recently been developed, namely, order-m and order-alpha. These approaches generalize free disposal hull by allowing for superefficient observations to be located beyond the estimated production-possibility frontier. Although these methods are also purely nonparametric, the sensitivity to outliers is substantially reduced by partial frontier approaches enveloping just a subsample of observations. In this article, I introduce the new Stata commands orderm and orderalpha, which implement order-m, order-alpha, and free disposal hull efficiency analysis in Stata.

Sensible parameters for univariate and multivariate splines,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2012,7,7,"The package bspline, downloadable from Statistical Software Components, now has three commands. The first, bspline, generates a basis of Schoenberg B-splines. The second, frencurv, generates a basis of reference splines whose parameters in the regression model are simply values of the spline at reference points on the X axis. The recent addition, flexcurv, is an easy-to-use version of frencurv that generates reference splines with automatically generated, sensibly spaced knots. frencurv and flexcurv now have the additional option of generating an incomplete basis of reference splines, with the reference spline for a baseline reference point omitted or set to 0. This incomplete basis can be completed by adding the standard unit vector to the design matrix and can then be used to estimate differences between values of the spline at the remaining reference points and the value of the spline at the baseline reference point. Reference splines therefore model continuous factor variables as indicator variables (or ""dummies"") model discrete factor variables. The method can be extended in a similar way to define factor-product bases, allowing the user to estimate factor-combination means, subset-specific effects, or even factor interactions involving multiple continuous or discrete factors.","sg151_2,bspline,fiexcurv,frencurv,polynomial,spline,B-spline,interpolation,linear,quadratic,cubic,multivariate,factor,interaction",,"Newson, Roger B.@Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Natl Heart & Lung Inst, London, England","Newson, Roger B.@Imperial College London",not exist,"Confidence intervals and p-values for delivery to the end user+Newson, R.+Stata Journal+2003::no title+NEWSON R+STATA TECHNICAL B+2000::Effect of thunderstorms and airborne grass pollen on the incidence of acute asthma in England, 1990-94+Newson, R; Strachan, D; Archibald, E; et al.+THORAX+AUG 1997::Sensible parameters for polynomials and other splines+Newson, R.

A robust instrumental-variables estimator,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2012,9,4,"The classical instrumental-variables estimator is extremely sensitive to the presence of outliers in the sample. This is a concern because outliers can strongly distort the estimated effect of a given regressor on the dependent variable. Although outlier diagnostics exist, they frequently fail to detect atypical observations because they are themselves based on nonrobust (to outliers) estimators. Furthermore, they do not take into account the combined influence of outliers in the first and second stages of the instrumental-variables estimator. In this article, we present a robust instrumental-variables estimator, initially proposed by Cohen Freue, Ortiz-Molina, and Zamar (2011, Working paper: http://www.stat.ubc.ca/similar to ruben/website/cv/cohen-zamar.pdf), that we have programmed in Stata and made available via the robivreg command. We have improved on their estimator in two different ways. First, we use a weighting scheme that makes our estimator more efficient and allows the computations of the usual identification and overidentifying restrictions tests. Second, we implement a generalized Hausman test for the presence of outliers.","st0252,robivreg,multivariate outliers,robustness,S-estimator,instrumental variables",STATA,"Desbordes, Rodolphe@Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland::Verardi, Vincenzo@Univ Namur, Ctr Res Econ Dev, Namur, Belgium@Univ Libre Brussels, European Ctr Adv Res Econ & Stat, Namur, Belgium@Univ Libre Brussels, Ctr Knowledge Econ, Namur, Belgium","Desbordes, Rodolphe@University of Strathclyde::Verardi, Vincenzo@University of Namur",not exist,"Enhanced routines for instrumental variables/generalized method of moments estimation and testing+Baum, Christopher F.; Schaffer, Mark E.; Stillman, Steven+STATA JOURNAL+2007::no title+Cohen Freue, G.

Faster estimation of a discrete-time proportional hazards model with gamma frailty,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2012,10,1,"Fitting a complementary log-log model that accounts for gamma-distributed unobserved heterogeneity often takes a significant amount of time. This is in part because numerical derivatives are used to approximate the gradient vector and Hessian matrix. The main contribution of this article is the use of Mata and a gf2 evaluator to express the gradient vector and Hessian matrix. Gradient vector expression allows one to use a few different options and postestimation commands. Furthermore, expression of the gradient vector and Hessian matrix increases the speed at which a likelihood function is maximized.

In this article, I present a complementary log-log model, show how the gamma distribution has been incorporated, and point out why the gradient vector and Hessian matrix can be expressed. I then discuss the speed at which a maximum is achieved, and I apply sampling weights that require an expression of the gradient vector. I introduce a new command for fitting this model.

Using the margins command to estimate and interpret adjusted predictions and marginal effects,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2012,4,290,"Many researchers and journals place a strong emphasis on the sign and statistical significance of effects-but often there is very little emphasis on the substantive and practical significance of the findings. As Long and Freese (2006, Regression Models for Categorical Dependent Variables Using Stata [Stata Press]) show, results can often be made more tangible by computing predicted or expected values for hypothetical or prototypical cases. Stata 11 introduced new tools for making such calculations-factor variables and the margins command. These can do most of the things that were previously done by Stata's own adjust and mfx commands, and much more.

Unfortunately, the complexity of the margins syntax, the daunting 50-page reference manual entry that describes it, and a lack of understanding about what margins offers over older commands that have been widely used for years may have dissuaded some researchers from examining how the margins command could benefit them.

In this article, therefore, I explain what adjusted predictions and marginal effects are, and how they can contribute to the interpretation of results. I further explain why older commands, like adjust and mfx, can often produce incorrect results, and how factor variables and the margins command can avoid these errors. The relative merits of different methods for setting representative values for variables in the model (marginal effects at the means, average marginal effects, and marginal effects at representative values) are considered. I shows how the marginsplot command (introduced in Stata 12) provides a graphical and often much easier means for presenting and understanding the results from margins, and explain why margins does not present marginal effects for interaction terms.","st0260,margins,marginsplot,adjusted predictions,marginal effects",,"Williams, Richard@Univ Notre Dame, Dept Sociol, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA","Williams, Richard@University of Notre Dame",not exist,"Estimation of Marginal Effects Using margeff+Bartus, Tamas.+Stata Journal+2005::no title+Colin, Cameron A.; Trivedi, Pravin K.+Microeconometrics Using Stata.+2010::no title+Long, JS; Freese, J.+Regression Models for Categorical Dependent Variables Using Stata+2006::no title+no author+Stata 12 User's Guide+2011"

Users can specify numeric formats, font sizes, and font types at the table cell level, as well as lines in the table and row spacing. Multiple tables can be written to the same document, making it possible to create a fully formatted statistical appendix from a do-file.

Respondent-driven sampling,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2012,20,50,"Respondent-driven sampling is a network sampling technique typically employed for hard-to-reach populations (for example, drug users, men who have sex with men, people with HIV). Similarly to snowball sampling, initial seed respondents recruit additional respondents from their network of friends. The recruiting process repeats iteratively, thereby forming long referral chains. Unlike in snowball sampling, it is crucial to obtain estimates of respondents' personal network sizes (that is, number of acquaintances in the target population) and information about who recruited whom. Markov chain theory makes it possible to derive population estimates and sampling weights.

Stata graph library for network analysis,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2012,26,11,"Network analysis is a multidisciplinary research method that is quickly becoming a popular and exciting field. Though some statistical programs possess sophisticated packages for analyzing networks, similar capabilities have yet to be made available in Stata. In an effort to motivate the use of Stata for network analysis, I designed in Mata the Stata graph library (SGL), which consists of algorithms that construct matrix representations of networks, compute centrality measures, calculate clustering coefficients, and solve maximum-flow problems. The SGL is designed for both directed and undirected one-mode networks containing edges that are either unweighted or weighted with positive values. Performance tests conducted between C++ and Stata graph library implementations indicate gross inefficiencies in current SGL routines, making the SGL impractical for large networks. The obstacles are, however, welcome challenges in the effort to spread the use of Stata for analyzing networks. Future developments will focus toward addressing computational time complexities and integrating additional capabilities into the SGL.","st0248,netsis,netsummarize,centrality,clustering,network analysis","CENTRALITY,BETWEENNESS","Miura, Hirotaka@Columbia Univ, Dept Math, New York, NY 10027 USA","Miura, Hirotaka@Columbia University",not exist,"no title+[Anonymous].+MatlabBGL by David Gleich+2008::no title+Anthonisse, Jac M.+The Rush in a Directed Graph.

In this article, we describe regression-based methods for analyzing multiple-source data in Stata. We use data from the BROMS Cohort Study, a cohort of Swedish adolescents who collected data on body mass index that was self-reported and that was measured by nurses. We draw together into a single frame of reference both source reports and relate these to smoking onset. This unified method has two advantages over traditional approaches: 1) the relative predictiveness of each source can be assessed and 2) all subjects contribute to the analysis.

A closer examination of three small-sample approximations to the multiple-imputation degrees of freedom,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2011,35,5,"Incomplete data is a common complication in applied research. In this study, we use simulation to compare two approaches to the multiple imputation of a continuous predictor: multiple imputation through chained equations and multivariate normal imputation. This study extends earlier work by being the first to 1) compare the small-sample approximations to the multiple-imputation degrees of freedom proposed by Barnard and Rubin (1999, Biometrika 86: 948-955); Lipsitz, Parzen, and Zhao (2002, Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation 72: 309-318); and Reiter (2007,Biometrika 94: 502-508) and 2) ask if the sampling distribution of the t statistics is in fact a Student's t distribution with the specified degrees of freedom.

In addition to varying the imputation method, we varied the number of imputations (m = 5,10,20, 100) that were averaged over 500,000 replications to obtain the combined estimates and standard errors for a linear model that regressed the log price of a home on its age (years) and size (square feet) in a sample of 25 observations. Six age values were randomly set equal to missing for each replication.

As assessed by the absolute percentage and relative percentage bias, the two approaches performed similarly. The absolute bias of the regression coefficients for age and size was roughly -0.1% across the levels of m for both approaches; the absolute bias for the constant was 0.6% for the chained-equations approach and 1.0% for the multivariate normal model. The absolute biases of the standard errors for age, size, and the constant were 0.2%, 0.3%, and 1.2%, respectively. In general, the relative percentage bias was slightly smaller for the chained-equations approach. Graphical and numerical inspection of the empirical sampling distributions for the three t statistics suggested that the area from the shoulder to the tail was reasonably well approximated by a t distribution and that the small-sample approximations to the multiple-imputation degrees of freedom proposed by Barnard and Rubin and by Reiter performed satisfactorily.","st0235,missing data,multiple imputation,small-sample degrees of freedom","FULLY CONDITIONAL SPECIFICATION,MISSING-DATA,SIGNIFICANCE TESTS,VALUES","Wagstaff, David A.@Penn State Univ, Coll Hlth & Human Dev, HHD Consulting Grp, University Pk, PA 16802 USA::Harel, Ofer@Univ Connecticut, Dept Stat, Storrs, CT 06269 USA","Wagstaff, David A.@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University::Harel, Ofer@University of Connecticut",not exist,"Missing data techniques for structural equation modeling+Allison, PD+JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY+NOV 2003::Multiple imputation for missing data - A cautionary tale+Allison, PD+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS &amp; RESEARCH+FEB 2000::Small-sample degrees of freedom with multiple imputation+Barnard, J; Rubin, DB+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1999::What Improves with Increased Missing Data Imputations?+Bodner, Todd E.+STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING-A MULTIDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL+OCT-DEC 2008::How many imputations are really needed? - Some practical clarifications of multiple imputation theory+Graham, John W.; Olchowski, Allison E.; Gilreath, Tamika D.+PREVENTION SCIENCE+SEP 2007::Inferences on missing information under multiple imputation and two-stage multiple imputation+Harel, O.+Statistical Methodology+2007::Multiple imputation: Review of theory, implementation and software+Harel, Ofer; Zhou, Xiao-Hua+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUL 20 2007::A note on determining the number of imputations for missing data+Hershberger, SL; Fisher, DG+STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING+2003::On the Assessment of Monte Carlo Error in Simulation-Based Statistical Analyses+Koehler, Elizabeth; Brown, Elizabeth; Haneuse, Sebastien J. -P.

Fitting fully observed recursive mixed-process models with cmp,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2011,38,200,"At the heart of many econometric models are a linear function and a normal error. Examples include the classical small-sample linear regression model and the probit, ordered probit, multinomial probit, tobit, interval regression, and truncated-distribution regression models. Because the normal distribution has a, natural multidimensional generalization, such models can be combined into multiequation systems in which the errors share a multivariate normal distribution. The literature has historically focused on multistage procedures for fitting mixed models, which are more efficient computationally, if less so statistically, than maximum likelihood. Direct maximum likelihood estimation has been made more practical by faster computers and simulated likelihood methods for estimating higher-dimensional cumulative normal distributions. Such simulated likelihood methods include the Geweke-Hajivassiliou-Keane algorithm (Geweke, 1989, Econometrics 57: :1317-1339; Hajivassiliou and McFadden, 1998, Econometrics 66: 863-896; Keane, 1994, Econometrics 62: 95-116). Maximum likelihood also facilitates a generalization to switching, selection, and other models in which the number and types of equations vary by observation. The Stata command cmp fits seemingly unrelated regressions models of this broad family. Its estimator is also consistent for recursive systems in which all endogenous variables appear on the right-hand sides as observed. If all the equations are structural, then estimation is full-inforrnation maximum likelihood. If only the final stage or stages are structural, then estimation is limited-information maximum likelihood. cmp can mimic a score of built-in and user-written Stata commands. It is also appropriate for a panoply of models that previously were hard to estimate. Heteroskedasticity, however, can render cmp inconsistent. This article explains the theory and implementation of cmp and of a related Mata function, ghk 2 (), that implements the Geweke-Hajivassiliou-Keane algorithm.","st0224,cmp,ghk2,Geweke-Hajivassiliou-Keane algorithm,recursive mixed-process models,seemingly unrelated regression,conditional mixed-process models","MULTINOMIAL PROBIT MODEL,ENDOGENOUS VARIABLES,DEPENDENT-VARIABLES,IDENTIFICATION,REGRESSION,ESTIMATOR,GENDER,MATA","Roodman, David@Ctr Global Dev, Washington, DC USA","Roodman, David@Unknow",not exist,"MULTIVARIATE REGRESSION AND SIMULTANEOUS EQUATION MODELS WHEN DEPENDENT VARIABLES ARE TRUNCATED NORMAL+AMEMIYA, T+ECONOMETRICA+1974::REGRESSION-ANALYSIS WHEN DEPENDENT VARIABLE IS TRUNCATED NORMAL+AMEMIYA, T+ECONOMETRICA+1973::THE ASYMPTOTIC PROPERTIES OF ESTIMATES OF THE PARAMETERS OF A SINGLE EQUATION IN A COMPLETE SYSTEM OF STOCHASTIC EQUATIONS+ANDERSON, TW; RUBIN, H+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1950::A practical technique to estimate multinomial probit models in transportation+Bolduc, D+TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL+JAN 1999::ESTIMABILITY IN THE MULTINOMIAL PROBIT MODEL+BUNCH, DS+TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL+FEB 1991::Fitting and interpreting Cragg's tobit alternative using Stata+Burke, William J.+STATA JOURNAL+2009::Multivariate probit regression using simulated maximum likelihood+Cappellari, L.; Jenkins, S.

The tenonradial and teradial commands fit data envelopment models where nonradial and radial technical efficiency measures are computed (Fare, 1998, Fundamentals of Production Theory; Fare and Lovell, 1978, Journal of Economic Theory 19: 150-162; Fare, Grosskopf, and Lovell, 1994a, Production Frontiers). Technical efficiency measures are obtained by solving linear programming problems. The teradialbc, nptestind, and nptestrts commands provide tools for making statistical inference regarding radial technical efficiency measures (Simar and Wilson, 1998, Management Science 44: 49-61; 2000, Journal of Applied Statistics 27: 779-802; 2002, European Journal of Operational Research 139: 115-132).

Versatile tests for comparing survival curves based on weighted log-rank statistics,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2016,9,0,"The log-rank test is perhaps the most Commonly used nonparametric method for comparing two survival curves and yields maximum power under proportional hazards alternatives. While the assumption of proportional hazards is often reasonable, it need not hold. Several authors have therefore developed versatile tests using combinations of weighted log-rank statistics that are more sensitive to nonproportional hazards. Fleming and Harrington (1991, Counting Processes and Survival Analysis, Wiley) consider the family of GP statistics and their supremum versions, while Lee (1996, Biometrics 52: 721-725) and Lee (2007, Computational Statistics and Data Analysis 51: 6557-6564) propose tests based on the more extended G(rho,gamma) family. In this article, I consider Z(m) = max(vertical bar Z(1)vertical bar, vertical bar Z(2)vertical bar, vertical bar Z(3)vertical bar), where Z(1), Z(2), and Z(3) are z statistics obtained from G(0,0), and G(0,1) tests, respectively. G(0,0) corresponds to the log-rank test, while G(1,0) and G(0,1) are more sensitive to early and late-difference alternatives. I conduct a simulation study to compare the performance of Z(m), with the log-rank test, the more optimally weighted test, and Lee's (2007) tests, under the null hypothesis, proportional hazards, early difference, and late-difference alternatives. Results indicate that the method based on Z(m), maintains the type I error rate, provides increased power relative to the log-rank test under early difference and late-difference alternatives, and entails only a small to moderate power loss compared with the more optimally chosen test. I apply the procedure to two datasets reported in the literature, both of which exhibit nonproportional hazards. Versatile tests such as may be useful in clinical trial settings where there is concern that the treatment effect may not conform to the proportional hazards assumption. I also describe the syntax for a Stata command, verswlr, to implement the method.","st0449,verswlr,survival curves,log-rank test,nonproportional hazards,versatile tests,power",,"Karrison, Theodore G.@Univ Chicago, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Karrison, Theodore G.@University of Chicago",not exist,"COMPUTATION OF THE TRIVARIATE NORMAL INTEGRAL+DREZNER, Z+MATHEMATICS OF COMPUTATION+JAN 1994::LOGISTIC-REGRESSION, SURVIVAL ANALYSIS, AND THE KAPLAN-MEIER CURVE+EFRON, B+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1988::no title+Fleming, T.

Implementing Rubin's alternative multiple-imputation method for statistical matching in Stata,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2016,13,0,"This article introduces two new commands, smpc and smmatch, that implement the statistical matching procedure proposed by Rubin (1986, Journal of Business and Economic Statistics 4: 87-94). The purpose of statistical matching in Rubin's procedure is to generate a single dataset from various datasets, where each dataset contains a specific variable of interest and all contain some variables in common. For two variables of interest that are not observed jointly for any unit, smpc generates the predicted values of each as a function of the other variable of interest and a set of control variables by assuming a partial correlation value (defined by the user) between the two variables of interest (other statistical matching procedures assume that they are conditionally independent given the control variables). The smmatch command, on the other hand, matches observations of different datasets according to their predicted values (using a minimum distance criterion) conditional on a set of control variables, and it imputes the observed value of the match for the missing.","st0452,smmatch,smpc,data combination,missing data,multiple imputation,statistical matching","FILE CONCATENATION,ADJUSTED WEIGHTS","Alpman, Anil@Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France","Alpman, Anil@heSam Universite@Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne@Paris School of Economics",not exist,"Implementing Rubin's alternative multiple imputation method for statistical matching in Stata+Alpman, A.+Working Paper 2015.08+2015::Multiple imputation by chained equations: what is it and how does it work?+Azur, Melissa J.; Stuart, Elizabeth A.; Frangakis, Constantine; et al.+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF METHODS IN PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH+MAR 2011::no title+CITRO CF+IMPROVING INFORM SOC+1991::no title+Enders, C.

The lag-length selection and detrending methods for HEGY seasonal unit-root tests using Stata,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2016,24,0,"The article extends the previous Hylleberg, Engle, Granger, and Yoo seasonal unit-root test commands (Baum and Sperling, 2001, https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s416502.html; Depalo, 2009, Stata Journal 9: 422-438), which allow for the use of both quarterly and monthly data. It is also possible to choose between ordinary least-squares and generalized least squares detrending (Rodrigues and Taylor, 2007, Journal of Econometrics 141: 548-573) procedures to deal with the deterministic part of the process. The command allows for the use of the sequential method proposed by Hall (1994, Journal of Business and Economic Statistics 12: 461-470) and Ng and Perron (1995, Journal of the American Statistical Association 90: 268-281), the adaptation of the modified Akaike information criteria to the case of seasonal unit-root tests (del Barrio Castro, Osborn, and Taylor, 2016, Econometric Reviews 35: 122-168) as well as the inclusion of Akaike information and Bayesian information criteria to determine the order of augmentation of the serial correlation in the augmented Hylleberg, Engle, Granger, and Yoo regression.

Implementing weighted-average estimation of substance concentration using multiple dilutions,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2016,7,0,"In medicine and chemistry, immunoassays are often used to measure substance concentration. These tests use an S-shaped standard curve to map the observed optical responses to the underlying concentration. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is one such test that is commonly used to measure antibody concentration in vaccine and infectious disease research. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and other immunoassays usually involve a series of doubling or tripling dilutions of the test samples so that some of the diluted samples fall within the near-linear range in the center of the standard curve. The dilution that falls within or is nearest to the center of the near-linear range may then be selected for statistical analysis. This common practice of using one dilution does not fully use the information from multiple dilutions and reduces accuracy. We describe a recently proposed weighted-average estimation approach for analyzing multiple-dilution data (Cheung et al. 2015, Journal of Immunological Methods 417: 115-123), and we present the new wavemid command, which carries out the approach. We also present the new command midreshape, which processes raw data in text format exported from some microplate readers into analyzable data format. We use data from an experimental study of malaria vaccine candidates to demonstrate use of the two commands.","st0434,wavemid,midreshape,immunoassay,multiple dilutions,weighted-average estimation","4-PARAMETER LOGISTIC MODEL,CALIBRATION","Xu, Ying@Duke NUS Grad Med Sch, Ctr Quantitat Med, Singapore, Singapore::Milligan, Paul@London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, London, England::Remarque, Edmond J.@Biomed Primate Res Ctr, Dept Parasitol, Rijswijk, Netherlands::Cheung, Yin Bun@Duke NUS Grad Med Sch, Ctr Quantitat Med, Singapore, Singapore@Univ Tampere, Dept Int Hlth, Tampere, Finland","Xu, Ying@National University of Singapore::Milligan, Paul@University of London@London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine::Remarque, Edmond J.@Unknow::Cheung, Yin Bun@University of Tampere@National University of Singapore",not exist,"no title+Brook, RJ; Arnold, GC.+Applied Regression Analysis and Experimental Design+1985::no title+CARROLL, R.

First, the rdrandinf command uses randomization methods to conduct point estimation, hypothesis testing, and confidence interval estimation under different assumptions. Second, the rdwinselect command uses finite-sample methods to select a window near the cutoff where the assumption of randomized treatment assignment is most plausible. Third, the rdsensitivity command uses randomization techniques to conduct a sequence of hypothesis tests for different windows around the RD cutoff, which can be used to assess the sensitivity of the methods and to construct confidence intervals by inversion. Finally, the rdrbounds command implements Rosenbaum (2002, Observational Studies [Springer]) sensitivity bounds for the context of RD designs under local randomization. Companion R functions with the same syntax and capabilities are also provided.","st0435,rdrandinf,rdwinselect,rdsensitivity,rdrbounds,regression discontinuity designs,quasi-experimental techniques,causal inference,randomization inference,finite-sample methods,Fisher's exact p-values,Neyman's repeated sampling approach","CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS,ROBUST","Cattaneo, Matias D.@Univ Michigan, Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA@Univ Michigan, Stat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA::Titiunik, Rocio@Univ Michigan, Polit Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA::Vazquez-Bare, Gonzalo@Univ Michigan, Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Cattaneo, Matias D.@University of Michigan@University of Michigan System::Titiunik, Rocio@University of Michigan@University of Michigan System::Vazquez-Bare, Gonzalo@University of Michigan@University of Michigan System",not exist,"ROBUST NONPARAMETRIC CONFIDENCE INTERVALS FOR REGRESSION-DISCONTINUITY DESIGNS+Calonico, Sebastian; Cattaneo, Matias D.; Titiunik, Rocio+ECONOMETRICA+NOV 2014::Optimal Data-Driven Regression Discontinuity Plots+Calonico, Sebastian; Cattaneo, Matias D.; Titiunik, Rocio+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2015::rdrobust: An R Package for Robust Nonparametric Inference in Regression-Discontinuity Designs+Calonico, Sebastian; Cattaneo, Matias D.; Titiunik, Rocio+R JOURNAL+JUN 2015::Robust data-driven inference in the regression-discontinuity design+Calonico, Sebastian; Cattaneo, Matias D.; Titiunik, Rocio+STATA JOURNAL+2014::rddensity: Manipulation testing based on density discontinuity+Cattaneo, M.

I consider three classes of IGM indices: 1) single-stage indices, 2) indices derived from a transition matrix between parents' and children's socioeconomic status, and 3) indices based on inequality measures. Users may add a fourth class to specify any possible IGM index not included in igmobil. Standard errors and confidence intervals are calculated using a bootstrap procedure. Users can customize many aspects of the program output, including the type and dimension of the transition matrix, the parameters for some IGM indices (like the ones involving generalized entropy measures and the Atkinson index), and how standard errors and confidence intervals are calculated.","st0437,igmobil,intergenerational mobility,IGM,bootstrap",INCOME MOBILITY,"Savegnago, Marco@Bank Italy, Rome, Italy","Savegnago, Marco@Unknow",not exist,"no title+Bartholomew, DJ.+Stochastic Models for Social Processes+1973::A nonparametric analysis of black-white differences in intergenerational income mobility in the United States+Bhattacharya, Debopam; Mazumder, Bhashkar+QUANTITATIVE ECONOMICS+NOV 2011::Recent Developments in Intergenerational Mobility+Black, Sandra E.; Devereux, Paul J.+HANDBOOK OF LABOR ECONOMICS, VOL 4B+2011::ETHICAL INDEXES OF INCOME MOBILITY+CHAKRAVARTY, SR; DUTTA, B; WEYMARK, JA+SOCIAL CHOICE AND WELFARE+1985::Mobility comparisons: Does using different measures matter?+Checchi, D.; Dardanoni, V.+Departmental Working Papers 2002-15+2002::Income mobility: A robust approach+Cowell, F.

Fixed effects in unconditional quantile regression,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2016,17,6,"Unconditional quantile regression has quickly become popular after being introduced by Firpo, Fortin, and Lemieux (2009, Econometrica 77: 953-973) and is easily implemented using the user-written command rifreg by the same authors. However, including high-dimensional fixed effects in rifreg is quite burdensome and sometimes even impossible. In this article, I show that when the number of fixed effects is large, the computational speed is massively increased by using xtreg rather than regress to fit the unconditional quantile regression models. I also introduce the xtrifreg command, which should be considered a supplement to rifreg. The xtrifreg command has many of the same features as rifreg but can be used to include a large number of fixed effects, to estimate cluster robust standard errors, and to estimate cluster bootstrapped standard errors.","st0438,xtrifreg,unconditional quantile regression,fixed effects","MOTHERHOOD PENALTY,MODELS,STATA","Borgen, Nicolai T.@Univ Oslo, Dept Sociol & Human Geog, Oslo, Norway","Borgen, Nicolai T.@University of Oslo",not exist,"no title+Allison, PD.+Fixed effects regression models+2009::Changes in the Economic Returns to Attending Prestigious Institutions in Norway+Borgen, Nicolai T.+EUROPEAN SOCIETIES+MAR 15 2015::Statistical Models and Empirical Evidence for Differences in the Motherhood Penalty across the Earnings Distribution+Budig, Michelle J.; Hodges, Melissa J.+AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW+APR 2014::A Practitioner's Guide to Cluster-Robust Inference+Cameron, A.

Calculate travel time and distance with OpenStreetMap data using the Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM),STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2016,4,14,"In this article, we introduce the osrmtime command, which calculates the distance and travel time between two points using latitude and longitude information. The command uses the Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM) and OpenStreetMap to find the optimal route by car, by bicycle, or on foot. The procedure is specially built for large georeferenced datasets. Because it is fast, the command uses the full computational capacity of a PC, allows the user to make unlimited requests, and is independent of the Internet and commercial online providers. Hence, there is no risk of the command becoming obsolete. Moreover, the results can be replicated at any time.","dm0088,osrmtime,osrmprepare,mqtime,traveltime3,OSRM,OpenStreetMap,Google Maps,MapQuest,geospatial analysis,ArcGIS,travel time,travel distance,public road network",,"Huber, Stephan@Univ Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany::Rust, Christoph@Univ Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany","Huber, Stephan@University of Regensburg::Rust, Christoph@University of Regensburg",not exist,"OpenStreetMap in GIScience: Experiences, Research, and Applications+no author+OPENSTREETMAP IN GISCIENCE: EXPERIENCES, RESEARCH, AND APPLICATIONS+2015::no title+Luxen, D.; Vetter, C.+P 19 ACM SIGSPATIAL+2011::Stata utilities for geocoding and generating travel time and travel distance information+Ozimek, Adam; Miles, Daniel+STATA JOURNAL+2011::mqtime: A Stata tool for calculating travel time and distance using MapQuest web services+Voorheis, John+Stata Journal+2015"
Panel time series: Review of the methodological evolution,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2016,46,1,"In this article, we discuss the econometric treatment of macropanels, also known as panel time series. This new approach rejects the assumption of slope homogeneity and handles nonstationarity. It also recognizes that cross-section dependence (that is, some correlation structure in the error term between units due to unobservable common factors) squanders efficiency gains by operating with a panel. This approach uses a new set of estimators known in the literature as the common correlated effect, which essentially consists of increasing the model to be fit by adding the averages of the individuals in each time t, of both the dependent variable and the specific regressors of each individual. We present two commands developed for the evaluation and treatment of cross-section dependence.","st0439,xtcsi,xtcips,panel time series,time series,cross-section dependence","UNIT-ROOT TESTS,DYNAMIC HETEROGENEOUS PANELS,MULTIFACTOR ERROR STRUCTURE,REGRESSION,INFERENCE,COINTEGRATION,ECONOMETRICS,POWER,BIAS","Burdisso, Tamara@Cent Bank Argentina, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina@Univ Buenos Aires, Stat, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina::Sangiacomo, Maximo@Cent Bank Argentina, Econ Res, La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina@Univ Nacl La Plata, Polit Econ, La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina","Burdisso, Tamara@University of Buenos Aires::Sangiacomo, Maximo@National University of La Plata",not exist,"no title+Arellano, M.+Panel Data Econometrics+2003::A panic attack on unit roots and cointegration+Bai, JS; Ng, S+ECONOMETRICA+JUL 2004::Estimating cross-section common stochastic trends in nonstationary panel data+Bai, JS+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+SEP 2004::Nonstationary panels, cointegration in panels and dynamic panels: A survey+Baltagi, BH; Kao, CW+ADVANCES ECOOMETRICS, VOL 15, 2000+2000::Testing for Panel Cointegration using Common Correlated Effects Estimators+Banerjee, A.; Carrion-i-Silvestre, J.+Discussion-Paper 11-16+2011::Credit vs. payment services: Financial development and economic activity revisited+Bebczuk, R.; Burdisso, T.; Sangiacomo, M.+Working Paper 56+2012::Estimation of nonstationary heterogeneous panels+Blackburne, Edward F., III; Frank, Mark W.+STATA JOURNAL+2007::The local power of some unit root tests for panel data+Breitung, J+ADVANCES ECOOMETRICS, VOL 15, 2000+2000::no title+BREITUNG J+ECONOMETRICS PANEL D+2008::THE LAGRANGE MULTIPLIER TEST AND ITS APPLICATIONS TO MODEL-SPECIFICATION IN ECONOMETRICS+BREUSCH, TS; PAGAN, AR+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+1980::Estimation and Inference of a Cointegrated Regression in Panel Data: A Monte Carlo Study+Chen, B.; McCoskey, S.; Kao, C.+American Journal of Mathematical and Management Sciences+1999::Unit root tests for panel data+Choi, I+JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MONEY AND FINANCE+APR 2001::New panel unit root tests of PPP+Coakley, J; Fuertes, AM+ECONOMICS LETTERS+NOV 28 1997::A principal components approach to cross-section dependence in panels+Coakley, J.; Fuertes, A.

Reference-based sensitivity analysis via multiple imputation for longitudinal trials with protocol deviation,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2016,17,0,"Randomized controlled trials provide essential evidence for the evaluation of new and existing medical treatments. Unfortunately, the statistical analysis is often complicated by the occurrence of protocol deviations, which mean we cannot always measure the intended outcomes for individuals who deviate, resulting in a missing-data problem. In such settings, however one approaches the analysis, an untestable assumption about the distribution of the unobserved data must be made. To understand how far the results depend on these assumptions, the primary analysis should be supplemented by a range of sensitivity analyses, which explore how the conclusions vary over a range of different credible assumptions for the missing data. In this article, we describe a new command, mimix, that can be used to perform reference-based sensitivity analyses for randomized controlled trials with longitudinal quantitative outcome data, using the approach proposed by Carpenter, Roger, and Kenward (2013, Journal of Biopharmaceutical Statistics 23: 1352-1371). Under this approach, we make qualitative assumptions about how individuals' missing outcomes relate to those observed in relevant groups in the trial, based on plausible clinical scenarios. Statistical analysis then proceeds using the method of multiple imputation.","st0440,mimix,clinical trial,protocol deviation,missing data,multiple imputation,sensitivity analysis","ACCESSIBLE ASSUMPTIONS,TREAT ANALYSIS,INFERENCE,FRAMEWORK,RELEVANT","Cro, Suzie@UCL, MRC Clin Trials Unit, London, England@London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London, England::Morris, Tim P.@UCL, MRC Clin Trials Unit, London, England@London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London, England::Kenward, Michael G.@London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London, England::Carpenter, James R.@UCL, MRC Clin Trials Unit, London, England@London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London, England","Cro, Suzie@University College London@University of London@Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit@London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine::Morris, Tim P.@University College London@University of London@Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit@London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine::Kenward, Michael G.@University of London@London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine::Carpenter, James R.@University College London@University of London@Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit@London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine","Morris, Tim@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5850-3610","Budesonide delivered by Turbuhaler is effective in a dose-dependent fashion when used in the treatment of adult patients with chronic asthma+Busse, WW; Chervinsky, P; Condemi, J; et al.+JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY+APR 1998::no title+Carpenter, J; Kenward, M.+Missing data in randomised controlled trials-a practical guide+2007::Response to Comments by Seaman et al. on ""Analysis of Longitudinal Trials With Protocol Deviation: A Framework for Relevant, Accessible Assumptions, and Inference via Multiple Imputation,"" Journal of Biopharmaceutical Statistics 23:1352-1371+Carpenter, J.

Partial credit model: Estimations and tests of fit with pcmodel,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2016,20,1,"The partial credit and rating scale models are classical models from item response theory; they belong to the generalized linear latent and mixed model family and allow one to analyze questionnaires such as patient-reported outcomes. Few goodness-of-fit testing procedures have been proposed for such models, and few computer programs implement such tests. Here we describe two tests: the Rim test (which tests the overall adequacy of the model to the data) and the Si test (which evaluates the contribution of each item to a possible lack of fit).

Abadie's semiparametric difference-in-differences estimator,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2016,4,3,"The difference-in-differences estimator measures the effect of a treatment or policy intervention by comparing change over time of the outcome variable across treatment groups. To interpret the estimate as a causal effect, this strategy requires that, in the absence of the treatment, the outcome variable followed the same trend in treated and untreated groups. This assumption may be implausible if selection for treatment is correlated with characteristics that affect the dynamic of the outcome variable. In this article, I describe the command asdid, which implements the semiparametric difference-in-differences (SDID) estimator of Abadie (2005, Review of Economic Studies 72: 1-19). The SDID is a reweighing technique that addresses the imbalance of characteristics between treated and untreated groups. Hence, it makes the parallel trend assumption more credible. In addition, the SDID estimator allows the use of covariates to describe how the average effect of the treatment varies for different groups of the treated population.","st0442,absdid,semiparametric estimations,difference-in-differences,propensity score",PROPENSITY SCORE,"Houngbedji, Kenneth@Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France","Houngbedji, Kenneth@Paris School of Economics",not exist,"Semiparametric difference-in-differences estimators+Abadie, A+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+JAN 2005::Efficient estimation of average treatment effects using the estimated propensity score+Hirano, K; Imbens, GW; Ridder, G+ECONOMETRICA+JUL 2003::ESTIMATION WITH CORRECTLY INTERPRETED DUMMY VARIABLES IN SEMI-LOGARITHMIC EQUATIONS+KENNEDY, PE+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+1981::THE CENTRAL ROLE OF THE PROPENSITY SCORE IN OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES FOR CAUSAL EFFECTS+ROSENBAUM, PR; RUBIN, DB+BIOMETRIKA+1983"

Regressions are commonly misinterpreted,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2016,17,1,"Much literature misinterprets results of fitting multivariable models for linear regression, logistic regression, and other generalized linear models, as well as for survival, longitudinal, and hierarchical regressions. For the leading case of multiple regression, regression coefficients can be accurately interpreted via the added-variable plot. However, a common interpretation does not reflect the way regression methods actually work. Additional support for the correct interpretation comes from examining regression coefficients in multivariate normal distributions and from the geometry of least squares. To properly implement multivariable models, one must be cautious when calculating predictions that average over other variables, as in the Stata command margins.","st0419,regression models,added-variable plot,multivariate normal distribution,geometry of least squares,margins command",,"Hoaglin, David C.@Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Quantitat Hlth Sci, Amherst, MA 01003 USA","Hoaglin, David C.@University of Massachusetts Amherst@University of Massachusetts System",not exist,"no title+Acock, AC.+A Gentle Introduction to Stata+2010::USE AND ABUSE OF REGRESSION+BOX, GEP+TECHNOMETRICS+1966::no title+Cook, R.

I discuss two potential advantages of the approach over the mvprobit command (Cappellari and Jenkins, 2003, Stata Journal 3: 278-294): significant reductions in computation time and essentially unlimited dimensionality of the outcome set. Computation time is reduced because the approach does not rely on simulation methods; unlimited dimensionality arises because only pairs of outcomes are considered at each estimation stage. This approach provides a consistent estimator of all the multivariate probit model's parameters under the same assumptions required for consistent estimation via mvprobit, and simulation exercises I provide suggest no loss of estimator precision relative to mvprobit.","st0423,bvpmvp(),bvopmvop(),multivariate probit models,bivariate probit",,"Mullahy, John@Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI USA@Natl Univ Ireland Galway, Madison, WI USA@Natl Bur Econ Res, Madison, WI USA","Mullahy, John@University of Wisconsin Madison@University of Wisconsin System@National Bureau of Economic Research",not exist,"Multivariate probit regression using simulated maximum likelihood+Cappellari, L.; Jenkins, S.

Specific options are included to obtain DID estimation on a repeated cross-section setting and to test the general balancing properties of the model.

mfpa: Extension of mfp using the ACD covariate transformation for enhanced parametric multivariable modeling,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2016,8,1,"In a recent article, Royston (2015, Stata Journal 15: 275-291) introduced the approximate cumulative distribution (ACD) transformation of a continuous covariate x as a route toward modeling a sigmoid relationship between x and an outcome variable. In this article, we extend the approach to multivariable modeling by modifying the standard Stata program mfp. The result is a new program, mfpa, that has all the features of mfp plus the ability to fit a new model for user selected covariates that we call FP1(p1,p2). The FP1(p1,p2) model comprises the best-fitting combination of a dimension-one fractional polynomial (FP1) function of x and an FP1 function of ACD (x). We describe a new model-selection algorithm called function-selection procedure with ACD transformation, which uses significance testing to attempt to simplify an FP1(pi, p2) model to a submodel, an FP1 or linear model in x or in ACD (x). The function-selection procedure with ACD transformation is related in concept to the FSP (FP function-selection procedure), which is an integral part of mfp and which is used to simplify a dimension-two (FP2) function. We describe the mfpa command and give univariable and multivariable examples with real data to demonstrate its use.","st0425,mfpa,mfp,continuous covariates,sigmoid function,ACD transformation,multivariable fractional polynomials,regression models",FRACTIONAL POLYNOMIALS,"Royston, Patrick@UCL, MRC Clin Trials Unit, London, England::Sauerbrei, Willi@Univ Freiburg, Med Ctr, Ctr Med Biometry & Med Informat, Freiburg, Germany","Royston, Patrick@University College London@University of London@Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit::Sauerbrei, Willi@University of Freiburg",not exist,"Prognostic survival model for people diagnosed with invasive cutaneous melanoma+Baade, Peter D.; Royston, Patrick; Youl, Philipa H.; et al.+BMC CANCER+JAN 31 2015::Improving the robustness of fractional polynomial models by preliminary covariate transformation: A pragmatic approach+Royston, P.; Sauerbrei, W.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+MAY 15 2007::REGRESSION USING FRACTIONAL POLYNOMIALS OF CONTINUOUS COVARIATES - PARSIMONIOUS PARAMETRIC MODELING+ROYSTON, P; ALTMAN, DG+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+1994::no title+Royston, P; Sauerbrei, W.+Multivariable model-building: A pragmatic approach to regression analysis based on fractional polynomials for modelling continuous variables+2008::Tools for checking calibration of a Cox model in external validation: Prediction of population-averaged survival curves based on risk groups+Royston, Patrick+STATA JOURNAL+2015::Multivariable modeling with cubic regression splines: A principled approach+Royston, Patrick; Sauerbrei, Willi+STATA JOURNAL+2007::Building multivariable prognostic and diagnostic models: transformation of the predictors by using fractional polynomials+Sauerbrei, W; Royston, P+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1999::RANDOMIZED 2X2 TRIAL EVALUATING HORMONAL TREATMENT AND THE DURATION OF CHEMOTHERAPY IN NODE-POSITIVE BREAST-CANCER PATIENTS+SCHUMACHER, M; BASTERT, G; BOJAR, H; et al.+JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY+OCT 1994"

bireprob: An estimator for bivariate random-effects probit models,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2016,21,1,"I present the bireprob command, which fits a bivariate random-effects probit model. bireprob enables a researcher to estimate two (seemingly unrelated) nonlinear processes and to control for interrelations between their unobservables. The estimator uses quasirandom numbers (Halton draws) and maximum simulated likelihood to estimate the correlation between the error terms of both processes. The application of bireprob is illustrated in two examples: the first one uses artificial data, and the second one uses real data. Finally, in a simulation, the performance of the estimator is tested and compared with the official Stata command xtprobit.","st0426,bireprob,bivariate random-effects probit,maximum simulated likelihood,Halton draws","MAXIMUM SIMULATED LIKELIHOOD,LOGIT-MODELS,UNEMPLOYMENT,EMPLOYMENT,POVERTY","Plum, Alexander@Univ Magdeburg, Chair Publ Econ, D-39106 Magdeburg, Germany","Plum, Alexander@Otto von Guericke University",not exist,"Ownership of stocks and mutual funds: A panel data analysis+Alessie, R; Hochguertel, S; van Soest, A+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+AUG 2004::Practitioners' corner - A note on estimated coefficients in random effects probit models+Arulampalam, W+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+NOV 1999::Unemployment persistence+Arulampalam, W; Booth, AL; Taylor, MP+OXFORD ECONOMIC PAPERS-NEW SERIES+JAN 2000::YOUTH POVERTY, EMPLOYMENT, AND LEAVING THE PARENTAL HOME IN EUROPE+Ayllon, Sara+REVIEW OF INCOME AND WEALTH+DEC 2015::From Stata to aML+Ayllon, Sara+STATA JOURNAL+2014::MEASURING STATE DEPENDENCE IN INDIVIDUAL POVERTY HISTORIES WHEN THERE IS FEEDBACK TO EMPLOYMENT STATUS AND HOUSEHOLD COMPOSITION+Biewen, Martin+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+NOV-DEC 2009::Calculation of multivariate normal probabilities by simulation, with applications to maximum simulated likelihood estimation+Cappellari, Lorenzo; Jenkins, Stephen P.+STATA JOURNAL+2006::Don't give up on me baby: Spousal correlation in smoking behaviour+Clark, Andrew E.; Etile, Fabrice+JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS+SEP 2006::Poverty and social exclusion: two sides of the same coin or dynamically interrelated processes?+Devicienti, Francesco; Poggi, Ambra+APPLIED ECONOMICS+2011::no title+Greene,, W.H.+Econometric analysis+2012::Dynamics of health and labor market risks+Haan, Peter; Myck, Michal+JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS+DEC 2009::Estimation of multinomial logit models with unobserved heterogeneity using maximum simulated likelihood+Haan, Peter; Uhlendorff, Arne+STATA JOURNAL+2006::The Incidental Parameters Problem and the Problem of Initial Conditions in Estimating a Discrete Time-Discrete Data Stochastic Process+Heckman, J.

We describe the commands surveybias, surveybiasi, and surveybiasseries, which enable the fast computation of these binomial and multinomial measures of bias in opinion surveys.

Bootstrap-based bias correction and inference for dynamic panels with fixed effects,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2015,29,2,"In this article, we describe a new command, xtbcfe, that performs the iterative bootstrap-based bias correction for the fixed-effects estimator in dynamic panels proposed by Everaert and Pozzi (2007, Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control 31: 1160-1184). We first simplify the core of their algorithm by using the invariance principle and subsequently extend it to allow for unbalanced and higher-order dynamic panels. We implement various bootstrap error resampling schemes to account for general heteroskedasticity and contemporaneous cross-sectional dependence. Inference can be performed using a bootstrapped variance covariance matrix or percentile intervals. Monte Carlo simulations show that the simplification of the original algorithm results in a further bias reduction for very small T. The Monte Carlo results also support the bootstrap-based bias correction in higher-order dynamic panels and panels with cross-sectional dependence. We illustrate the command with an empirical example estimating a dynamic labor demand function.","st0396,xtbcfe,bootstrap-based bias correction,dynamic panel data,unbalanced,higher order,heteroskedasticity,cross-sectional dependence,Monte Carlo,labor demand,bootstrap","DATA MODELS,ERROR-COMPONENTS,INSTRUMENTS,ESTIMATORS,DEPENDENCE","De Vos, Ignace@Univ Ghent, SHERPPA, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium::Everaert, Gerdie@Univ Ghent, SHERPPA, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium::Ruyssen, Ilse@Univ Ghent, SHERPPA, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium","De Vos, Ignace@Ghent University::Everaert, Gerdie@Ghent University::Ruyssen, Ilse@Ghent University",not exist,"no title+Anselin,, L.+Spatial econometrics: methods and models+1988::ANOTHER LOOK AT THE INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE ESTIMATION OF ERROR-COMPONENTS MODELS+ARELLANO, M; BOVER, O+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUL 1995::SOME TESTS OF SPECIFICATION FOR PANEL DATA - MONTE-CARLO EVIDENCE AND AN APPLICATION TO EMPLOYMENT EQUATIONS+ARELLANO, M; BOND, S+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+APR 1991::Initial conditions and moment restrictions in dynamic panel data models+Blundell, R; Bond, S+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+NOV 1998::Estimation and Inference in Dynamic Unbalanced Panel-Data Models with a Small Number of Individuals+Bruno, G.

Estimating the treatment effect in a clinical trial using difference in restricted mean survival time,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2015,15,3,"The causal effect of a new medical treatment compared with a standard regimen is best assessed in a randomized controlled trial setting. When the main outcome is time to some event of interest, such as death, studies often use the hazard ratio to describe the treatment effect. Typically, proportional hazards are assumed. Here I discuss several significant disadvantages of using the hazard ratio, including its vulnerability to the proportionality assumption, its relative nature, and its lack of relationship with time-to-event or survival probabilities. I describe the use of restricted mean survival time as an alternative outcome measure in time-to-event trials. With this method, the treatment effect is defined as the difference in restricted mean between the trial arms. I suggest the use of Royston and Parmar's (2002, Statistics in Medicine 21: 2175-2197) class of flexible parametric models, implemented through the command stpm2 (Lambert and Royston [2009, Stata Journal 9: 265-290] and Andersson and Lambert [2012, Stata Journal 12: 623-638]), to estimate the required quantities. With this approach, proportional hazards are not assumed. I describe a new command, strmst, for implementing these calculations.

Prediction in linear index models with endogenous regressors,Stata Journal,NO DOI,2015,20,0,"In this article, we examine prediction in the context of linear index models when one or more of the regressors are endogenous. To facilitate both within-sample and out-of-sample predictions, Stata offers the postestimation command predict (see [R] predict). We believe that the usefulness of the predictions provided by this command is limited, especially if one is interested in out-of-sample predictions. We demonstrate our point using a probit model with continuous endogenous regressors, although it clearly generalizes readily to other linear index models. We subsequently provide a program that offers one possible implementation of a new command, ivpredict, that can be used to address this shortcoming of predict, and we then illustrate its use with an empirical example.","st0397,predict,probit,logit,ivprobit,prediction,linear index,endogenous regressors,ivpredict,out-of-sample prediction",TESTS,"Skeels, Christopher L.@Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia::Taylor, Larry W.@Lehigh Univ, Dept Econ, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA","Skeels, Christopher L.@University of Melbourne::Taylor, Larry W.@Lehigh University",not exist,"ESTIMATION OF A SIMULTANEOUS EQUATION GENERALIZED PROBIT MODEL+AMEMIYA, T+ECONOMETRICA+1978::IVREG2: Stata module for extended instrumental variables/2SLS and GMM estimation+Baum, C; Schaffer, M; Stillman, S.+Statistical Software Components+2002::no title+Cameron, A.; Trivedi, P.+Microeconometrics: Methods and Applications+2005::no title+Cameron, A.

"Record linkage using Stata: Preprocessing, linking, and reviewing utilities",Stata Journal,NO DOI,2015,5,4,"In this article, we describe Stata utilities that facilitate probabilistic record linkage-the technique typically used for merging two datasets with no common record identifier. While the preprocessing tools are developed specifically for linking two company databases, the other tools can be used for many different types of linkage. Specifically, the stnd_compname and stnd_address commands parse and standardize company names and addresses to improve the match quality when linking. The reclink2 command is a generalized version of Blasnik's reclink (2010, Statistical Software Components S456876, Department of Economics, Boston College) that allows for many-to-one matching. Finally, clrevmatch is an interactive tool that allows the user to review matched results in an efficient and seamless manner. Rather than exporting results to another file format (for example, Excel), inputting clerical reviews, and importing back into Stata, one can use the clrevmatch tool to conduct all of these steps within Stata. This helps improve the speed and flexibility of matching, which often involves multiple runs.","dm0082,reclink2,clrevmatch,reclink,stnd_compname,stnd_address,record linkage,fuzzy matching,string standardization",,"Wasi, Nada@Univ Michigan, Inst Social Res, Survey Res Ctr, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA::Flaaen, Aaron@Fed Reserve Board Governors, Div Res & Stat, Washington, DC USA","Wasi, Nada@University of Michigan@University of Michigan System::Flaaen, Aaron@Federal Reserve System - USA@Federal Reserve System Board of Governors",not exist,"ESTIMATING MEASUREMENT ERROR IN ANNUAL JOB EARNINGS: A COMPARISON OF SURVEY AND ADMINISTRATIVE DATA+Abowd, John M.; Stinson, Martha H.+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+DEC 2013::Some simple economics of crowdfunding+Agrawal, A.K.; Catalini, C.; Goldfarb, A.+Working paper.+2013::reclink: Stata module to probabilistically match records+Blasnik, M.+Statistical Software Components S456876+2010::no title+Christen, P.+Data Matching: Concepts and Techniques for Record Linkage, Entity Resolution, and Duplicate Detection+2012::A THEORY FOR RECORD LINKAGE+FELLEGI, IP; SUNTER, AB+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1969"

Approximate Bayesian logistic regression via penalized likelihood by data augmentation,Stata Journal,NO DOI,2015,29,8,"We present a command, penlogit, for approximate Bayesian logistic regression using penalized likelihood estimation via data augmentation. This command automatically adds specific prior-data records to a dataset. These records are computed so that they generate a penalty function for the log likelihood of a logistic model, which equals (up to an additive constant) a set of independent log prior distributions on the model parameters. This command overcomes the necessity of relying on specialiZed software and statistical tools (such as Markov chain Monte Carlo) for fitting Bayesian models, and allows one to assess the information content of a prior in terms of the data that would be required to generate the prior as a likelihood function. The command produces data equivalent to normal and generalized log-F priors for the model parameters, providing flexible translation of background information into prior data, which allows calculation of approximate posterior medians and intervals from ordinary maximum likelihood programs. We illustrate the command through an example using data from an observational study of neonatal mortality.","st0400,penlogit,penalized likelihood estimation,data augmentation,Bayesian methods,logistic models","EPIDEMIOLOGIC RESEARCH,PROFILE LIKELIHOOD,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,VARIABLE SELECTION,PRIORS,DISTRIBUTIONS,PERSPECTIVES","Discacciati, Andrea@Karolinska Inst, Inst Environm Med, Unit Biostat, S-10401 Stockholm, Sweden@Karolinska Inst, Inst Environm Med, Unit Nutr Epidemiol, S-10401 Stockholm, Sweden::Orsini, Nicola@Karolinska Inst, Inst Environm Med, Unit Biostat, S-10401 Stockholm, Sweden@Karolinska Inst, Inst Environm Med, Unit Nutr Epidemiol, S-10401 Stockholm, Sweden@Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Stat, Los Angeles, CA USA::Greenland, Sander@Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Epidemiol, Los Angeles, CA USA","Discacciati, Andrea@Karolinska Institutet::Orsini, Nicola@University of California System@Karolinska Institutet@University of California Los Angeles::Greenland, Sander@University of California System@University of California Los Angeles",not exist,"A new perspective on priors for generalized linear models+Bedrick, EJ; Christensen, R; Johnson, W+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1996::The log F: A distribution for all seasons+Brown, BW; Spears, FM; Levy, LB+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS+2002::Maximum Likelihood, Profile Likelihood, and Penalized Likelihood: A Primer+Cole, Stephen R.; Chu, Haitao; Greenland, Sander+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+JAN 15 2014::Bayesian Posterior Distributions Without Markov Chains+Cole, Stephen R.; Chu, Haitao; Greenland, Sander; et al.+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+MAR 1 2012::Firthlogit: Stata Module to Calculate Bias Reduction in Logistic Regression+Coveney, J.+Statistical Software Components+2008::PARTIAL LIKELIHOOD+COX, DR+BIOMETRIKA+1975::no title+Efron, B.+Large-scale inference: empirical Bayes methods for estimation, testing, and prediction+2012::BIAS REDUCTION OF MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATES+FIRTH, D+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1993::MODELING AND VARIABLE SELECTION IN EPIDEMIOLOGIC ANALYSIS+GREENLAND, S+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH+MAR 1989::Generalized conjugate priors for Bayesian analysis of risk and survival regressions+Greenland, S+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2003::Putting background information about relative risks into conjugate prior distributions+Greenland, S+BIOMETRICS+SEP 2001::When should epidemiologic regressions use random coefficients?+Greenland, S+BIOMETRICS+SEP 2000::Bayesian perspectives for epidemiological research: I.

Feasible fitting of linear models with N fixed effects,Stata Journal,NO DOI,2015,12,0,"In this article, I describe an alternative approach for fitting linear models with multiple high-order fixed effects.

I illustrate implementing this approach using the U.S. Census Bureau Current Population Survey data with four fixed effects.

In this article, we present several new features for the package. First, we allow hazard ratios greater than 1 to be targeted under the alternative hypothesis to make the design more widely applicable to other outcomes and disease areas. Second, we introduce new subroutines that use simulation to more accurately estimate the correlation between treatment effects at different stages and that calculate the familywise error rate, and we apply them to an example using the original design of the multiarm, multistage trial in prostate cancer. Finally,. we present a new design of the dialog menu for nstage that improves its usability and incorporates options for calling the new subroutines.","st0175_1,nstage,nstagemenu,multiarm,multistage,randomized controlled trial,survival analysis,time-to-event,familywise error rate","CLINICAL-TRIALS,OVARIAN-CANCER,OF-BENEFIT,DESIGN,STAMPEDE","Bratton, Daniel J.@UCL, MRC Clin Trials Unit, London, England::Choodari-Oskooei, Babak@UCL, MRC Clin Trials Unit, London, England::Royston, Patrick@UCL, MRC Clin Trials Unit, London, England","Bratton, Daniel J.@University College London@University of London@Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit::Choodari-Oskooei, Babak@University College London@University of London@Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit::Royston, Patrick@University College London@University of London@Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit",not exist,"Communication from the Commission on the Reform of the Common Fisheries Policy: Roadmap+[Anonymous].+Technical Report+2002::Issues in the design and analysis of clinical trials with time-to-event outcomes+Barthel, F.

Multiple imputation of covariates by substantive-model compatible fully conditional specification,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2015,11,5,"Multiple imputation is a practical, principled approach to handling missing data. When used to impute missing values in covariates of regression models, imputation models may be misspecified if they are not compatible with the substantive model of interest for the outcome. In this article, we introduce the smcf cs command, which imputes covariates by substantive-model compatible fully conditional specification. This modifies the popular fully conditional specification or chained-equations approach to multiple imputation by imputing each covariate compatibly with a user-specified substantive model. We compare the smcf cs command with standard fully conditional specification imputation using mi impute chained in a simulation study and illustrative analysis of data from a study investigating time to tumor recurrence in breast cancer.","st0387,smcfcs,multiple imputation,substantive model compatible,congenial,interactions,nonlinearities",VALUES,"Bartlett, Jonathan W.@Univ London London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Med Stat, London WC1E 7HT, England::Morris, Tim P.@UCL, MRC Clin Trials Unit, Inst Clin Trials & Methodol, London, England@Univ London London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1E 7HT, England","Bartlett, Jonathan W.@University of London@London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine::Morris, Tim P.@University College London@University of London@Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit@London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine","Bartlett, Jonathan@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7117-0195::Morris, Tim@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5850-3610","Multiple imputation of covariates by fully conditional specification: Accommodating the substantive model+Bartlett, J.

Implementing intersection bounds in Stata,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2015,24,4,"We present the clrbound, clr2bound, clr3bound, and clrtest commands for estimation and inference on intersection bounds as developed by Chernozhukov, Lee, and Rosen (2013, Econometrics 81: 667-737). The intersection bounds framework encompasses situations where a population parameter of interest is partially identified by a collection of consistently estimable upper and lower bounds. The identified set for the parameter is the intersection of regions defined by this collection of bounds. More generally, the methodology can be applied to settings where an estimable function of a vector-valued parameter is bounded from above and below, as is the case when the identified set is characterized by conditional moment inequalities.

The commands clrbound, clr2bound, and clr3bound provide bound estimates that can be used directly for estimation or to construct asymptotically valid confidence sets. clrtest performs an intersection bound test of the hypothesis that a collection of lower intersection bounds is no greater than zero. The command clrbound provides bound estimates for one-sided lower or upper intersection bounds on a parameter, while clr2bound and clr3bound provide two-sided bound estimates using both lower and upper intersection bounds. clr2bound uses Bonferroni's inequality to construct two-sided bounds that can be used to perform asymptotically valid inference on the identified set or the parameter of interest, whereas clr3bound provides a generally tighter confidence interval for the parameter by inverting the hypothesis test performed by clrt est. More broadly, inversion of this test can also be used to construct confidence sets based on conditional moment inequalities as described in Chernozhukov, Lee, and Rosen (2013). The commands include parametric, series, and local linear estimation procedures.","st0369,clrbound,clr2bound,clr3bound,clrtest,intersection bounds,bound analysis,conditional moments,partial identification,infinite dimensional constraints,adaptive moment selection","CONDITIONAL MOMENT INEQUALITIES,PARTIALLY IDENTIFIED PARAMETERS,INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES,CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS,ECONOMETRIC-MODELS,INFERENCE,RETURNS","Chernozhukov, Victor@MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA::Kim, Wooyoung@Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI USA::Lee, Sokbae@Inst Fiscal Studies, Seoul, South Korea@Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul, South Korea::Rosen, Adam M.@UCL, London, England@Ctr Microdata Methods & Practice, London, England","Chernozhukov, Victor@Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)::Kim, Wooyoung@University of Wisconsin Madison@University of Wisconsin System::Lee, Sokbae@Seoul National University::Rosen, Adam M.@University College London@University of London","Lee, Sokbae@F-7514-2011@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4080-7733","Inference Based on Conditional Moment Inequalities+Andrews, Donald W.

Estimation of ordered response models with sample selection,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2011,22,18,"We introduce two new Stata commands for the estimation of an ordered response model with sample selection. The opsel command uses a standard maximum-likelihood approach to lit a parametric specification of the model where errors are assumed to follow a bivariate Gaussian distribution. The snpopsel command uses the semi-nonparametric approach of Gallant and Nychka. (1987,Econornetrica. 55: 363-390) to fit a semiparametric specification of the model where the bivariate density function of the errors is approximated by a Hermite polynomial expansion. The snpopsel command extends the set of Stata routines for semi-nonparametric estimation of discrete response models. Compared to the other semi-nonparametric estimators, our routine is relatively faster because it is programmed in Mata. In addition, we provide new postestimation routines to compute linear predictions, predicted probabilities, and marginal effects. These improvements are also extended to the set of semi-nonparametric Stata commands originally written by Stewart (2004, Stata journal 4: 27-39) and De Luca (2008, Stata journal 8: 190-220).

M statistic commands: Interpoint distance distribution analysis,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2011,7,5,"We implement the commands mstat and mtest to perform inference based on the M statistic, a statistic that can be used to compare the interpoint distance distribution across groups of observations.

The analyses are based on the study of the interpoint distances between n points in a k-dimensional setting to produce a one-dimensional real-valued test statistic. The locations are distributed in a region of the plane. When we consider all (72) interpoint distances, the dependencies among them are difficult to express analytically, but their distribution is informative, and the M statistic can be built to summarize one aspect of this information.

The two commands can be used on a wide class of datasets to test the null hypothesis that two groups have the same (spatial) distribution. mstat and mtest return the exact M test statistic. Moreover, mtest executes a Monte Carlo type permutation test, which returns the empirical p-value together with its confidence interval. This is the command to use in most situations, because the convergence of M to its asymptotic chi-squared distribution is slow.

Both commands can be used to obtain graphical output of the empirical density function of the interpoint distance distributions in the two groups and the two-dimensional map of the 71 observations in the plane.

The descriptions of the commands are accompanied by examples of applications with real and simulated data. We run the test on the Alt and Vach grave site dataset (Manjourides and Pagano, forthcoming, Statistics in Medicine) and reject the null hypothesis, in contradiction to other published analyses. We also show how to adapt the techniques to discrete datasets with more than one unit in each location. Finally, we report an extensive application on breast cancer data in Massachusetts; in the application, we show the compatibility of the M commands with Pisati's spmap package.","st0228,mstat,mtest,M statistic,interpoint distance,Monte Carlo test,spmap",,"Tebaldi, Pietro@Bocconi Univ, Dept Decis Sci, Milan, Italy::Bonetti, Marco@Bocconi Univ, Dept Decis Sci, Milan, Italy::Pagano, Marcello@Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Tebaldi, Pietro@Bocconi University::Bonetti, Marco@Bocconi University::Pagano, Marcello@Harvard University","Bonetti, Marco@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2304-4180","The interpoint distance distribution as a descriptor of point patterns, with an application to spatial disease clustering+Bonetti, M; Pagano, M+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+MAR 15 2005::no title+MANJOURIDES J+STAT MED IN PRESS+no time::no title+*MASS DEP PUBL HLT+CANC INC MASS 2002 2+2009::no title+MERRYMAN S+USMPAS2 STATA MODULE+2005::Simple thematic mapping+Pisati, M.+Stata J+2004::no title+WALLER, L.

Nonparametric item response theory using Stata,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2011,19,21,"Item response theory is a set of models and methods allowing for the analysis of binary or ordinal variables (items) that are influenced by a latent variable or latent trait-that is, a variable that cannot be measured directly. The theory was originally developed in educational assessment but has many other applications in clinical research, ecology, psychiatry, and economics.

The Mokken scales have been described by Mokken (1971, A Theory and Procedure of Scale Analysis [De Gruyter]). They are composed of items that satisfy the three fundamental assumptions of item response theory: unidimensionality, monotonicity, and local independence. They can be considered nonparametric models in item response theory. Traces of the items and Loevinger's H coefficients are particularly useful indexes for checking whether a set of items constitutes a Mokken scale.

However, these indexes are not available in general statistical packages. We introduce Stata commands to compute them.

Nonparametric bounds for the causal effect in a binary instrumental-variable model,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2011,35,8,"Instrumental variables can be used to make inferences about causal effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding. For a model in which the instrument, intermediate/treatment, and outcome variables are all binary, Balke and Pearl (1997, Journal of the American Statistical Association 92: 1172-1.176) derived nonparametric bounds for the intervention probabilities and the average causal effect. We have implemented these bounds in two commands: bpbounds and bpboundsi. We have also implemented several extensions to these bounds. One of these extensions applies when the instrument and outcome are measured in one sample and the instrument and intermediate are measured in another sample. We have also implemented the bounds for an instrument with three categories, as is common in Mendelian randomization analyses in epidemiology and for the case where a monotonic effect of the instrument on the intermediate can be assumed. In each case, we calculate the instrumental-variable inequality constraints as a check for gross violations of the instrumental-variable conditions. The use of the commands is illustrated with a re-creation of the original Balke and Pearl analysis and with a Mendelian randomization analysis. We also give a simulated example to demonstrate that the instrumental-variable inequality constraints can both detect and fail to detect violations of the instrumental-variable conditions.","st0232,bpbounds,bpboundsi,average causal effect,causal inference,instrumental variables,nonparametric bounds","MENDELIAN RANDOMIZATION,INFERENCE,IDENTIFICATION,HOMOCYSTEINE,EPIDEMIOLOGY","Palmer, Tom M.@Univ Bristol, MRC Ctr Causal Anal Translat Epidemiol, Sch Social & Community Med, Bristol BS8 1TH, Avon, England::Ramsahai, Roland R.@Univ Cambridge, Stat Lab, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England::Didelez, Vanessa@Univ Bristol, Sch Math, Bristol BS8 1TH, Avon, England::Sheehan, Nuala A.@Univ Leicester, Dept Hlth Sci, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England@Univ Leicester, Dept Genet, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England","Palmer, Tom M.@University of Bristol::Ramsahai, Roland R.@University of Cambridge::Didelez, Vanessa@University of Bristol::Sheehan, Nuala A.@University of Leicester","Didelez, Vanessa@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8587-7706::Palmer, Tom@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4655-4511","Identification of causal effects using instrumental variables+Angrist, JD; Imbens, GW; Rubin, DB+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1996::2-STAGE LEAST-SQUARES ESTIMATION OF AVERAGE CAUSAL EFFECTS IN MODELS WITH VARIABLE TREATMENT INTENSITY+ANGRIST, JD; IMBENS, GW+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1995::Bounds on treatment effects from studies with imperfect compliance+Balke, A; Pearl, J+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1997::no title+BALKE A+P 10 C UNC ART INT S+1994::no title+Baum, C.

Comparing coefficients of nested nonlinear probability models,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2011,19,162,"In a series of recent articles, Karlson, Holm, and Breen (Breen, Karlson, and Holm, 2011, http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstractid=1730065; Karlson and Holm, 2011, Research in Stratification and Social Mobility 29: 221 237;.Karlson, Holm, and Breen, 2010, http://www.yale.edu/ciqle/Breen_Scaling %20effects.pdf) have developed a method for comparing the estimated coefficients of two nested nonlinear probability models. In this article, we describe this method and the user-written program khb, which implements the method. The KHB method is a general decomposition method that is unaffected by the resealing or attenuation bias that arises in cross-model comparisons in nonlinear models. It recovers the degree to which a control variable, Z, mediates or explains the relationship between X and a latent outcome variable, Y*, underlying the nonlinear probability model. It also decomposes effects of both discrete and continuous variables, applies to average partial effects, and provides analytically derived statistical tests. The method can be extended to other models in the generalized linear model family.","st0236,khb,decomposition,path analysis,total effects,indirect effects,direct effects,logit,probit,primary effects,secondary effects,generalized linear model,KHB method","EDUCATIONAL-ATTAINMENT,CLASS DIFFERENTIALS","Kohler, Ulrich@Wissensch Zentrum Berlin, Social Sci Res Ctr, Berlin, Germany::Karlson, Kristian Bernt@Unknow::Holm, Anders@Aarhus Univ, Dept Educ, Ctr Strateg Educ Res, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark","Kohler, Ulrich@Unknow::Karlson, Kristian Bernt@Unknow::Holm, Anders@Aarhus University","Karlson, Kristian Bernt@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5886-2127::Kohler, Ulrich@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5614-6063","no title+Blau, Peter Michael; Duncan, Otis Dudley.+The American occupational structure+1967::no title+Boudon, R.+Education, Opportunity, and Social Inequality.

gformula: Estimating causal effects in the presence of time-varying confounding or mediation using the g-computation formula,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2011,44,34,"Tins article describes a new command, gformula, that is an implementation of the g-computation procedure. It is used to estimate the causal effect of time-varying exposures on an outcome in the presence of time-varying confounders that are themselves also affected by the exposures. The procedure also addresses the related problem of estimating direct and indirect effects when the causal effect of the exposures on an outcome is mediated by intermediate variables, and in particular when confounders of the mediator-outcome relationships are themselves affected by the exposures. A brief overview of the theory and a description of the command and its options are given, and illustrations using two simulated examples are provided.","st0238,gformula,causal inference,g-computation formula,time-varying confounding,mediation,direct and indirect effects","MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS,INFERENCE,SURVIVAL,EXPOSURE","Daniel, Rhian M.@London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Ctr Stat Methodol, London WC1, England::De Stavola, Bianca L.@London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Ctr Stat Methodol, London WC1, England::Cousens, Simon N.@London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Ctr Stat Methodol, London WC1, England","Daniel, Rhian M.@University of London@London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine::De Stavola, Bianca L.@University of London@London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine::Cousens, Simon N.@University of London@London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine","De Stavola, Bianca Lucia@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7853-0528::Daniel, Rhian@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5649-9320","Dynamic econometric program evaluation+Abbring, J.

"Bayesian model averaging and weighted-average least squares: Equivariance, stability, and numerical issues",STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2011,20,24,"In this article, we describe the estimation of linear regression models with uncertainty about the choice of the explanatory variables. We introduce the Stata commands bma and wals, which implement, respectively, the exact Bayesian model-averaging estimator and the weighted-average least-squares estimator developed by Magnus, Powell, and Prufer (2010, Journal of Econometrics 154: 139-153). Unlike standard pretest estimators that are based on some preliminary diagnostic test, these model-averaging estimators provide a coherent way of making inference on the regression parameters of interest by taking into account the uncertainty due to both the estimation and the model selection steps. Special emphasis is given to several practical issues that users are likely to face in applied work: equivariance to certain transformations of the explanatory variables, stability, accuracy, computing speed, and out-of-memory problems. Performances of our bma and wals commands are illustrated using simulated data and empirical applications from the literature on model-averaging estimation.","st0239,bma,wals,model uncertainty,model averaging,Bayesian analysis,exact Bayesian model averaging,weighted-average least squares","GROWTH,REGRESSION,SELECTION","De Luca, Giuseppe@ISFOL, Rome, Italy::Magnus, Jan R.@Tilburg Univ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands","De Luca, Giuseppe@Unknow::Magnus, Jan R.@Tilburg University",not exist,"no title+Cheney, W.; Kincaid, D.+Numerical Mathematics and Computing+2008::Estimation of the mean of a univariate normal distribution when the variance is not known+Danilov, D+ECONOMETRICS JOURNAL+2005::On the harm that ignoring pretesting can cause+Danilov, D; Magnus, JR+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+SEP 2004::no title+Dardanoni, V.; De Luca, C.; Modica, S.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Peracchi, F</span>.+A generalized missing indicator approach to regression with imputed covariates+2011::Regression with imputed covariates: A generalized missing-indicator approach+Dardanoni, Valentino; Modica, Salvatore; Peracchi, Franco+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUN 2011::no title+Einmahl, J.

Treatment interactions with nonexperimental data in Stata,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2011,7,6,"Treatment effects may vary with the observed. characteristics of the treated, often with important implications. In the context of experimental data, a growing literature deals with the problem of specifying treatment interaction terms that most effectively capture this variation. Sonic results of this literature are now implemented in Stata. With nonexperimental (observational) data., and in particular when selection into treatment depends on unmeasured factors, treatment effects can be estimated using Stata's treatreg command. Though not originally designed for this purpose, treatreg can be used to consistently estimate treatment interaction parameters. With interactions, however, adjustments are required to generate predicted values and estimate the average treatment effect. In this article, we introduce commands that perform this adjustment for multiplicative interactions, and we show the required adjustment for more complicated interactions.","st0240,itreatreg,treatment-effects models,interaction terms",,"Brown, Graham K.@Univ Bath, Ctr Dev Studies, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England@Univ Bath, Dept Social & Policy Sci, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England::Mergoupis, Thanos@Univ Bath, Dept Econ, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England","Brown, Graham K.@University of Bath::Mergoupis, Thanos@University of Bath","Brown, Graham@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4531-1828","Treatment effect model+Drukker, D.; Cong, R.+Stata Technical Bulletin+2000::no title+Greene,, W.H.+Econometric analysis+2012::Interactions between treatment and continuous covariates: A step toward individualizing therapy+Royston, Patrick; Sauerbrei, Willi+JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY+MAR 20 2008::Two techniques for investigating interactions between treatment and continuous covariates in clinical trials+Royston, Patrick; Sauerbrei, Willi+STATA JOURNAL+2009::Detecting an interaction between treatment and a continuous covariate: A comparison of two approaches+Sauerbrei, Willi; Royston, Patrick; Zapien, Karina+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+MAY 1 2007::no title+no author+Stata 12 Base Reference Manual+2011::Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data, 2nd Edition+Wooldridge, JM+ECONOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF CROSS SECTION AND PANEL DATA, 2ND EDITION+2010"

(2005, Proceedings of the National Academy of Science 102: 9730-9733) for decomposing a total effect in a logit model into direct and indirect effects. Moreover, I extend this method in three ways. First, in the original method the variable through which the indirect effect occurs is assumed to be normally distributed. In this article, the method is generalized by allowing this variable to have any distribution. Second, the original method did not provide standard errors for the estimates. In this article, the bootstrap is proposed as a method of providing those. Third, I show how to include control variables in this decomposition, which was not allowed in the original method.

Centering and reference groups for estimates of fixed effects: Modifications to felsdvreg,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2010,27,23,"Availability of large, multilevel longitudinal databases in various fields including labor economics (with workers and firms observed over time) and education research (with students and teachers observed over time) has increased the application of panel-data models with multiple levels of fixed-effects. Existing software routines for fitting fixed-effects models were not designed for applications in which the primary interest is obtaining estimates of any of the fixed-effects parameters. Such routines typically report estimates of fixed effects relative to arbitrary holdout units. Contrasts to holdout units are not ideal in cases where the fixed-effects parameters are of interest because they can change capriciously, they do not correspond to the structural parameters that are typically of interest, and they are inappropriate for empirical Bayes (shrinkage) estimation. We develop an improved parameterization of fixed-effects models using sum-to-zero constraints that provides estimates of fixed effects relative to mean effects within well-defined reference groups (e.g., all firms of a given type or all teachers of a given grade) and provides standard errors for those estimates that are appropriate for shrinkage estimation. We implement our parameterization in a Stata routine called felsdvregdm by modifying the felsdvreg routine designed for fitting high-dimensional fixed-effects models. We demonstrate our routine with an example dataset from the Florida Education Data Warehouse.","st0185,felsdvreg,felsdvregdm,fixed effects,linked employer-employee data,longitudinal achievement data","STUDENT-ACHIEVEMENT,TEACHERS,PERFORMANCE,MODEL","Mihaly, Kata@RAND Corp, Washington, DC USA::McCaffrey, Daniel F.@RAND Corp, Pittsburgh, PA USA::Lockwood, J.

Analyzing longitudinal data in the presence of informative drop-out: The jmre1 command,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2010,21,7,"Many studies in various research areas have designs that involve repeated measurements over time of a continuous variable across a group of subjects. A frequent and serious problem in such studies is the occurrence of missing data. In many cases, missing data are caused by an event that leads to a premature termination of the series of repeated measurements on some subjects. When the probability of the occurrence of this event is related to the subject-specific underlying trend of the variable of interest, this missingness process is called informative censoring or informative drop-out. Standard likelihood-based methods (for example, linear mixed models) fail to give consistent estimates. In such cases, one needs to apply methods that simultaneously model the observed data and the missingness process. In this article, we review a method proposed by Touloumi et al. (1999, Statistics in Medicine 18: 1215-1233) to adjust for informative drop-out in longitudinal data analysis. We also present the jmre1 command, which can be used to fit the proposed model. The estimation method combines the restricted iterative generalized least-squares method with a nested expectation-maximization algorithm. The method is implemented mainly using Stata's matrix programming language, Mata. Our example is derived from the epidemiology of the HIV infection.","st0190,jmre1,jmre1_p,datajoint1,missing data,informative censoring,informative drop-out,longitudinal data","MISSING DATA,MODELS","Pantazis, Nikos@Univ Athens, Sch Med, Dept Hyg Epidemiol & Med Stat, GR-11527 Athens, Greece::Touloumi, Giota@Univ Athens, Sch Med, Dept Hyg Epidemiol & Med Stat, GR-11527 Athens, Greece","Pantazis, Nikos@Athens Medical School@University of Athens::Touloumi, Giota@Athens Medical School@University of Athens",not exist,"no title+DIGGLE P+APPL STAT-J ROY ST C+1994::Simultaneously modelling censored survival data and repeatedly measured covariates: A Gibbs sampling approach+Faucett, CL; Thomas, DC+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+AUG 15 1996::EFFICIENT COMPUTATIONAL PROCEDURES FOR THE ESTIMATION OF PARAMETERS IN MULTILEVEL MODELS BASED ON ITERATIVE GENERALIZED LEAST-SQUARES+GOLDSTEIN, H; RASBASH, J+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JAN 1992::no title+Johnson, N.

Comparing the predictive powers of survival models using Harrell's C or Somers' D,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2010,10,150,"Medical researchers frequently make statements that one model predicts survival better than another, and they are frequently challenged to provide rigorous statistical justification for those statements.

The implemented instrumental-variable procedures estimate the causal effects for the subpopulation of compliers and are only well suited for binary instruments. ivqte also provides analytical standard errors and various options for nonparametric estimation.

Fitting heterogeneous choice models with oglm,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2010,21,84,"When a binary or ordinal regression model incorrectly assumes that error variances are the same for all cases, the standard errors are wrong and (unlike ordinary least squares regression) the parameter estimates are biased. Heterogeneous choice models (also known as location scale models or heteroskedastic ordered models) explicitly specify the determinants of heteroskedasticity in an attempt to correct for it. Such models are also useful when the variance itself is of substantive interest. This article illustrates how the author's Stata program oglm (ordinal generalized linear models) can be used to fit heterogeneous choice and related models. It shows that two other models that have appeared in the literature (Allison's model for group comparisons and Hauser and Andrew's logistic response model with proportionality constraints) are special cases of a heterogeneous choice model and alternative parameterizations of it. The article further argues that heterogeneous choice models may sometimes be an attractive alternative to other ordinal regression models, such as the generalized ordered logit model fit by gologit2. Finally, the article offers guidelines on how to interpret, test, and modify heterogeneous choice models.","st0208,oglm,heterogeneous choice model,location-scale model,gologit2,ordinal regression,heteroskedasticity,generalized ordered logit model","PROBIT COEFFICIENTS,STRATIFICATION,TRANSITIONS,LOGIT","Williams, Richard@Univ Notre Dame, Dept Sociol, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA","Williams, Richard@University of Notre Dame",not exist,"Comparing logit and probit coefficients across groups+Allison, PD+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS &amp; RESEARCH+NOV 1999::no title+Amemiya,, T.+Advanced Econometrics+1985::no title+BLAU PM+OCCUPATIONAL CHANGES+1983::no title+Duncan, Otis D.+Introduction to Structural Equation Models+1975::no title+Gould, W; Pitblado, J; Sribney, W<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Corporation, S</span>.+Maximum likelihood estimation with Stata+2006::Another look at the stratification of educational transitions: The logistic response model with partial proportionality constraints+Hauser, Robert M.; Andrew, Megan+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODOLOGY 2006, VOL 36+2006::no title+Hoetker, G.

Frequentist q-values for multiple-test procedures,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2010,17,36,"Multiple-test procedures are increasingly important as technology increases scientists' ability to make large numbers of multiple measurements, as they do in genome scans. Multiple-test procedures were originally defined to input a vector of input p-values and an uncorrected critical p-value, interpreted as a familywise error rate or a false discovery rate, and to output a corrected critical p-value and a discovery set, defined as the subset of input p-values that are at or below the corrected critical p-value. A range of multiple-test procedures is implemented using the smileplot package in Stata (Newson and the ALSPAC Study Team 2003, Stata Journal 3: 109-132; 2010, Stata Journal 10: 691-692). The qqvalue command uses an alternative formulation of multiple-test procedures, which is also used by the R function p. adjust. qqvalue inputs a variable of p-values and outputs a variable of q-values that are equal in each observation to the minimum familywise error rate or false discovery rate that would result in the inclusion of the corresponding p-value in the discovery set if the specified multiple-test procedure was applied to the full set of input p-values.

Making spatial analysis operational: Commands for generating spatial-effect variables in monadic and dyadic data,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2010,38,6,"Spatial dependence exists whenever the expected utility of one unit of analysis is affected by the decisions or behavior made by other units of analysis. Spatial dependence is ubiquitous in social relations and interactions. Yet, there are surprisingly few social science studies accounting for spatial dependence. This holds true for settings in which researchers use monadic data, where the unit of analysis is the individual unit, agent, or actor, and even more true for dyadic data settings, where the unit of analysis is the pair or dyad representing an interaction or a relation between two individual units, agents, or actors. Dyadic data offer more complex ways of modeling spatial-effect variables than do monadic data.

Age-period-cohort modeling,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2010,11,23,"Age-period-cohort models provide a useful method for modeling incidence and mortality rates. It is well known that age-period-cohort models suffer from an identifiability problem due to the exact relationship between the variables (cohort = period - age). In 2007, Carstensen published an article advocating the use of an analysis that models age, period, and cohort as continuous variables through the use of spline functions (Carstensen, 2007, Statistics in Medicine 26: 3018-3045). Carstensen implemented his method for age-period-cohort models in the Epi package for R. In this article, a new command is introduced, apcfit, that performs the methods in Stata. The identifiability problem is overcome by forcing constraints on either the period or cohort effects. The use of the command is illustrated through an example relating to the incidence of colon cancer in Finland. The example shows how to include covariates in the analysis.","st0211,apcfit,poprisktime,age-period-cohort models,incidence rates,mortality rates,Lexis diagrams","FUTURE BURDEN,CANCER,RATES","Rutherford, Mark J.@Univ Leicester, Dept Hlth Sci, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England::Lambert, Paul C.@Univ Leicester, Dept Hlth Sci, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England::Thompson, John R.@Univ Leicester, Dept Hlth Sci, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England","Rutherford, Mark J.@University of Leicester::Lambert, Paul C.@University of Leicester::Thompson, John R.@University of Leicester",not exist,"Predicting the future burden of cancer+Bray, F; Moller, B+NATURE REVIEWS CANCER+JAN 2006::Age-period-cohort models for the Lexis diagram+Carstensen, B.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUL 10 2007::FLEXIBLE REGRESSION-MODELS WITH CUBIC-SPLINES+DURRLEMAN, S; SIMON, R+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+MAY 1989::THE ESTIMATION OF AGE, PERIOD AND COHORT EFFECTS FOR VITAL-RATES+HOLFORD, TR+BIOMETRICS+1983::no title+LAND KC+DISENTANGLING AGE PE+2008::Prediction of cancer incidence in the Nordic countries: empirical comparison of different approaches+Moller, B; Fekjaer, H; Hakulinen, T; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+SEP 15 2003::The future burden of cancer in England: incidence and numbers of new patients in 2020+Moller, H.; Fairley, L.; Coupland, V.; et al.+BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER+MAY 7 2007::USING AGE, PERIOD AND COHORT MODELS TO ESTIMATE FUTURE MORTALITY-RATES+OSMOND, C+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+1985::Age-period-cohort models: A comparative study of available methodologies+Robertson, C; Gandini, S; Boyle, P+JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY+JUN 1999::no title+SVERDRUP E+STAT METODER DODELIK+1967::A methodological comparison of age-period-cohort models: The intrinsic estimator and conventional generalized linear models+Yang, Y; Fu, WJJ; Land, KC+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODOLOGY, 2004, VOL 34+2004"

The Skillings-Mack test (Friedman test when there are missing data),STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2009,7,32,"The Skillings-Mack statistic (Skillings and Mack, 1981, Technometrics 23: 171-177) is a general Friedman-type statistic that call be used ill almost any block design with an arbitrary missing-data structure. The missing data call be either missing by design, for example, all incomplete block design, or missing completely at random. The Skillings-Mack test is equivalent to the Friedman test when there are no missing data ill a balanced complete block design, and the Skillings-Mack test is equivalent to the test suggested in Durbin (1951, British Journal of Psychology, Statistical Section 4: 85-90) for a balanced incomplete block design. The Friedman test was implemented in Stata by Goldstein (19911 Stata Technical Bulletin 3: 26-27) and further developed in Goldstein (2005, Stata, Journal 5: 285). This article introduces the skilmack command, which performs the Skillings-Mack test.

The skilmack command is also useful when there are many ties or equal ranks (N.B. the Friedman statistic compared with the chi(2) distribution will give a conservative result), as well as for small samples, appropriate results call be obtained by simulating the distribution of the test statistic under the mill hypothesis.","st0167,skilmack,Skillings-Mack,Friedman,block design,nonparametric,unbalanced,missing data,ties",,"Chatfield, Mark@MRC, Collaborat Ctr Human Nutr Res, Populat Nutr Res Sect, Cambridge, England::Mander, Adrian@MRC, Collaborat Ctr Human Nutr Res, Populat Nutr Res Sect, Cambridge, England","Chatfield, Mark@MRC Human Nutrition Research::Mander, Adrian@MRC Human Nutrition Research","mander, adrian@E-5261-2010@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0742-9040::Chatfield, Mark@N-2278-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0004-6274","STUDIES ON METRONOME EFFECT OF STUTTERING+BRADY, JP+BEHAVIOUR RESEARCH AND THERAPY+1969::INCOMPLETE BLOCKS IN RANKING EXPERIMENTS+Durbin, J.+BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY-STATISTICAL SECTION+JUN 1951::The use of ranks to avoid the assumption of normality implicit in the analysis of variance+Friedman, M+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1937::Software update: snp2 1: Friedman's ANOVA test and Kendall's coefficient of concordance+Goldstein, R.+Stata Journal+2005::Friedman's ANOVA &amp; Kendall's coefficient of concordance+Goldstein, R.+Stata Tech Bull+1991::no title+Hollander, M.; Wolfe, A.

In studies of classification accuracy, there are often covariates that should be incorporated into the ROC analysis. We describe three ways of using covariate information. For factors that affect; marker observations among controls, we present a method for covariate adjustment. For factors that affect discrimination (i.e., the ROC curve), we describe methods for modeling the ROC curve as a function of covariates. Finally, for factors that contribute to discrimination, we propose combining the marker and covariate information, and we ask how much discriminatory accuracy improves (in incremental value) with the addition of the marker to the covariates. These methods follow naturally when representing the ROC curve as a summary of the distribution of case marker observations, standardized with respect to the control distribution.","st0155,roccurve,comproc,rocreg,receiver operating characteristic analysis,ROC,covariates,sensitivity,specificity","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION,PARAMETERS,REGRESSION,MARKERS,CANCER,CURVE,TESTS","Janes, Holly@Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Seattle, WA 98104 USA::Longton, Gary@Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Seattle, WA 98104 USA::Pepe, Margaret S.@Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Seattle, WA 98104 USA","Janes, Holly@Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center::Longton, Gary@Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center::Pepe, Margaret S.@Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center",not exist,"Distribution-free ROC analysis using binary regression techniques+Alonzo, TA; Pepe, MS+BIOSTATISTICS+SEP 2002::The central role of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves in evaluating tests for the early detection of cancer+Baker, SG+JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE+APR 2 2003::Partial AUC estimation and regression+Dodd, LE; Pepe, MS+BIOMETRICS+SEP 2003::MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION OF PARAMETERS OF SIGNAL-DETECTION THEORY AND DETERMINATION OF CONFIDENCE INTERVALS - RATING-METHOD DATA+DORFMAN, DD; ALF, E+JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1969::no title+HEAGERTY PJ+APPL STAT+1999::no title+JANES H+BIOMETRIKA IN PRESS+no time::Adjusting for covariates in studies of diagnostic, screening, or prognostic markers: An old concept in a new setting+Janes, Holly; Pepe, Margaret S.+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+JUL 1 2008::Combining several screening tests: Optimality of the risk score+McIntosh, MW; Pepe, MS+BIOMETRICS+SEP 2002::Computing Interaction Effects and Standard Errors in Logit and Probit Models+Norton, E.

How to do xtabond2: An introduction to difference and system GMM in Stata,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2009,24,"1,157","The difference and system generalized method-of-moments estimators, developed by Holtz-Eakin, Newey, and Rosen (1988, Econometrica 56: 13711395); Arellano and Bond (1991, Review of Economic Studies 58: 277-297); Arellano and Bover (1995, Journal of Econometrics 68: 29-51); and Blundell and Bond (1998, Journal of Econometrics 87: 115-143), are increasingly popular. Both are general estimators designed for situations with ""small T, large N"" panels, meaning few time periods and many individuals; independent variables that are not strictly exogenous, meaning they are correlated with past and possibly current realizations of the error; fixed effects; and heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation within individuals. This pedagogic article first introduces linear generalized method of moments. Then it describes how limited time span and potential for fixed effects and endogenous regressors drive the design of the estimators of interest, offering Stata-based examples along the way. Next it describes how to apply these estimators with xtabond2. It also explains how to perform the Arellano-Bond test for autocorrelation in a panel after other Stata commands, using abar. The article concludes with some tips for proper use.","st0159,xtabond2,generalized method of moments,GMM,Arellano-Bond test,abar","PANEL-DATA MODELS,DYNAMIC-MODELS,ESTIMATORS,RESTRICTIONS","Roodman, David@Ctr Global Dev, Washington, DC USA","Roodman, David@Unknow",not exist,"no title+ANDERSON TG+J BUSINESS EC STAT+1996::FORMULATION AND ESTIMATION OF DYNAMIC-MODELS USING PANEL DATA+ANDERSON, TW; HSIAO, C+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+1982::no title+Arellano, M.; Bond, S.+Dynamic panel data estimation using dpd98 and gauss: A guide for users+1998::ANOTHER LOOK AT THE INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE ESTIMATION OF ERROR-COMPONENTS MODELS+ARELLANO, M; BOVER, O+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUL 1995::SOME TESTS OF SPECIFICATION FOR PANEL DATA - MONTE-CARLO EVIDENCE AND AN APPLICATION TO EMPLOYMENT EQUATIONS+ARELLANO, M; BOND, S+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+APR 1991::Instrumental Variables and GMM: Estimation and Testing+Baum, Christopher F; Schaffer, Mark E.; Stillman, Steven.+Stata Journal+2003::Stock markets, banks, and growth: Panel evidence+Beck, T; Levine, R+JOURNAL OF BANKING &amp; FINANCE+MAR 2004::Initial conditions and moment restrictions in dynamic panel data models+Blundell, R; Bond, S+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+NOV 1998::Dynamic panel data models: a guide to micro data methods and practice+Bond, S.

Linear dynamic panel-data estimation using maximum likelihood and structural equation modeling,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2018,31,0,"Panel data make it possible both to control for unobserved confounders and to include lagged, endogenous regressors. However, trying to do both simultaneously leads to serious estimation difficulties. In the econometric literature, these problems have been addressed by using lagged instrumental variables together with the generalized method of moments, while in sociology the same problems have been dealt with using maximum likelihood estimation and structural equation modeling. While both approaches have merit, we show that the maximum likelihood structural equation models method is substantially more efficient than the generalized method of moments method when the normality assumption is met and that the former also suffers less from finite sample biases. We introduce the command xtdpdml, which has syntax similar to other Stata commands for linear dynamic panel-data estimation. xtdpdml greatly simplifies the structural equation model specification process; makes it possible to test and relax many of the constraints that are typically embodied in dynamic panel models; allows one to include time-invariant variables in the model, unlike most related methods; and takes advantage of Stata's ability to use full-information maximum likelihood for dealing with missing data. The strengths and advantages of xtdpdml are illustrated via examples from both economics and sociology.","st0523,xtdpdml,linear dynamic panel-data,structural equation modeling,maximum likelihood","EFFICIENT ESTIMATION,MISSING DATA,VARIABLES","Williams, Richard@Univ Notre Dame, Dept Sociol, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA::Allison, Paul D.@Univ Penn, Dept Sociol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA::Moral-Benito, Enrique@Banco Espana, DG Econ Stat & Res, Madrid, Spain","Williams, Richard@University of Notre Dame::Allison, Paul D.@University of Pennsylvania::Moral-Benito, Enrique@Unknow",not exist,"no title+Acock, AC.+Discovering structural equation modeling using Stata+2013::EFFICIENT ESTIMATION OF MODELS FOR DYNAMIC PANEL-DATA+AHN, SC; SCHMIDT, P+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUL 1995::Maximum likelihood for cross-lagged panel models with fixed effects+Allison, P.

baselinetable: A command for creating one- and two-way tables of summary statistics,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2018,2,0,"In this article, I describe baselinetable, a community-contributed command for creating one- and two-way tables of summary statistics for a list of numeric variables. Unlike other Stata tabulation commands such as tabulate, table, or tabstat, the variables forming the table rows can be a mixture of continuous (summarized by mean, standard deviation, etc.) and categorical (summarized by percentages and frequencies). baselinetable provides considerable flexibility in the way the results are displayed. In particular, the summary statistics and their presentation can be different for each row variable. Additional features include several options for displaying counts of missing and nonmissing data points and the ability to restrict results to subgroups of the data for individual row variables. The contents of the table can be saved as a data file or text file, or they can be exported to Excel. The motivation for baselinetable is the descriptive table commonly seen in health research publications in which the baseline characteristics of two or more groups are compared. This descriptive table usually has only one column for each group, generally with at least two summary statistics in each column (for example, mean and standard deviation for continuous variables or frequency and percentage for categorical variables). The baselinetable command supports reproducible research by enabling researchers to easily create tables whose contents can be used unchanged in publications.","st0524,baselinetable,summary statistics table,health research tables",,"Donath, Susan@Univ Melbourne, Clin Epidemiol & Biostat Unit, Dept Paediat, Melbourne, Vic, Australia@Royal Childrens Hosp, Murdoch Childrens Res Inst, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","Donath, Susan@University of Melbourne@Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne@Murdoch Children's Research Institute",not exist,"CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration: updated guidelines for reporting parallel group randomised trials+Moher, David; Hopewell, Sally; Schulz, Kenneth F.; et al.+BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL+MAR 23 2010::CONSORT 2010 Statement: updated guidelines for reporting parallel group randomised trials+Schulz, Kenneth F.; Altman, Douglas G.; Moher, David; et al.+BMC MEDICINE+MAR 24 2010"
Simulating the central limit theorem,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2018,10,0,"Understanding the central limit theorem is crucial for comprehending parametric inferential statistics.

cvcrand and cptest: Commands for efficient design and analysis of cluster randomized trials using constrained randomization and permutation tests,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2018,26,0,"Cluster randomized trials (CRTs), where clusters (for example, schools or clinics) are randomized to comparison arms but measurements are taken on individuals, are commonly used to evaluate interventions in public health, education, and the social sciences. Because CRTs typically involve a small number of clusters (for example, fewer than 20), simple randomization frequently leads to baseline imbalance of cluster characteristics across study arms, threatening the internal validity of the trial. In CRTs with a small number of clusters, classic approaches to balancing baseline characteristics such as matching and stratification have several drawbacks, especially when the number of baseline characteristics the researcher desires to balance is large (Ivers et al., 2012, Trials 13: 120). An alternative design approach is covariate-constrained randomization, whereby a randomization scheme is randomly selected from a subset of all possible randomization schemes based on the value of a balancing criterion (Raab and Butcher, 2001, Statistics in Medicine 20: 351-365). Subsequently, a clustered permutation test can be used in the analysis, which provides increased power under constrained randomization compared with simple randomization (Li et al., 2016, Statistics in Medicine 35: 1565-1579). In this article, we describe covariate-constrained randomization and the permutation test for the design and analysis of CRTs and provide an example to demonstrate the use of our new commands cvcrand and cptest to implement constrained randomization and the permutation test.","st0526,cvcrand,cptest,covariate-constrained randomization,cluster randomized trials,permutation test","RECENT METHODOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS,COMMUNITY INTERVENTION TRIALS,BALANCE","Gallis, John A.@Duke Univ, Dept Biostat & Bioinformat, Duke Global Hlth Inst, Durham, NC 27708 USA::Li, Fan@Duke Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biostat & Bioinformat, Durham, NC USA::Yu, Hengshi@Univ Michigan, Dept Biostat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA::Turner, Elizabeth L.@Duke Univ, Dept Biostat & Bioinformat, Duke Global Hlth Inst, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Gallis, John A.@Duke University::Li, Fan@Duke University::Yu, Hengshi@University of Michigan@University of Michigan System::Turner, Elizabeth L.@Duke University",not exist,"Consort 2010 statement: extension to cluster randomised trials+Campbell, Marion K.; Piaggio, Gilda; Elbourne, Diana R.; et al.+BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL+SEP 4 2012::Balance algorithm for cluster randomized trials+Carter, Ben R.; Hood, Kerenza+BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY+OCT 9 2008::tablel: Stata module to create table 1 of baseline characteristics for a manuscript+Clayton, P.+Statistical Software Components 5457730+2013::The ""best balance"" allocation led to optimal balance in cluster-controlled trials+de Hoop, Esther; Teerenstra, Steven; van Gaal, Betsie G.

Power and sample-size analysis for the Royston Parmar combined test in clinical trials with a time-to-event outcome,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2018,19,0,"Randomized controlled trials with a time-to-event outcome are usually designed and analyzed assuming proportional hazards (PH) of the treatment effect. The sample-size calculation is based on a log-rank test or the nearly identical Cox test, henceforth called the Cox/log-rank test. Nonproportional hazards (non-PH) has become more common in trials and is recognized as a potential threat to interpreting the trial treatment effect and the power of the log-rank test hence to the success of the trial. To address the issue, in 2016, Royston and Parmar (BMC Medical Research Methodology 16: 16) proposed a ""combined test"" of the global null hypothesis of identical survival curves in each trial arm. The Cox/logrank test is combined with a new test derived from the maximal standardized difference in restricted mean survival time (RMST) between the trial arms. The test statistic is based on evaluations of the between-arm difference in RMST over several preselected time points. The combined test involves the minimum p-value across the Cox/log-rank and RMST-based tests, appropriately standardized to have the correct distribution under the global null hypothesis. In this article, I introduce a new command, power_ct, that uses simulation to implement power and sample-size calculations for the combined test. power_ct supports designs with PH or non-PH of the treatment effect. I provide examples in which the power of the combined test is compared with that of the Cox/log-rank test under PH and non-PH scenarios. I conclude by offering guidance for sample-size calculations in time-to-event trials to allow for possible non-PH.","st0510,power_ct,randomized controlled trial,time-to-event outcome,restricted mean survival time,log-rank test,Cox test,combined test,treatment effect,hypothesis testing,flexible parametric model","MEAN SURVIVAL-TIME,NONPROPORTIONAL HAZARDS,REGRESSION-ANALYSIS,PSEUDO-OBSERVATIONS,MODELS,PACLITAXEL,DIFFERENCE,CANCER,UPDATE","Royston, Patrick@UCL, MRC Clin Trials Unit, London, England","Royston, Patrick@University College London@University of London@Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit",not exist,"Regression analysis of restricted mean survival time based on pseudo-observations+Andersen, PK; Hansen, MG; Klein, JP+LIFETIME DATA ANALYSIS+DEC 2004::Fitting and modeling cure in population-based cancer studies within the framework of flexible parametric survival models+Andersson, Therese M. -L.; Lambert, Paul C.+STATA JOURNAL+2012::Evaluation of sample size and power for multi-arm survival trials allowing for non-uniform accrual, non-proportional hazards, loss to follow-up and cross-over+Barthel, F.

Therefore, latent Dirichlet allocation provides a way to analyze the content of large unclassified text data and an alternative to predefined document classifications.","st0515,ldagibbs,machine learning,latent Dirichlet allocation,Gibbs sampling,topic model,text analysis",TEXT,"Schwarz, Carlo@Univ Warwick, Coventry, W Midlands, England","Schwarz, Carlo@University of Warwick",not exist,"strdist: Stata module to calculate the Levenshtein distance, or edit distance, between strings+Barker, M.+Statistical Software Components 5457547+2012::Translation from narrative text to standard codes variables with Stata+Belotti, Federico; Depalo, Domenico+STATA JOURNAL+2010::Latent Dirichlet allocation+Blei, DM; Ng, AY; Jordan, MI+JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH+MAY 15 2003::Finding scientific topics+Griffiths, TL; Steyvers, M+PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA+APR 6 2004::Transparency and deliberation within the FOMC: A computational linguistics approach.+Hansen, S.; McMahon, M.; Prat, A.+Quarterly Journal of Economics+no time::Empirical study of topic modeling in twitter+Hong, Liangjie; Davison, Brian D.+P 1 WORKSH SOC MED A+2010::TWILITE: A recommendation system for Twitter using a probabilistic model based on latent Dirichlet allocation+Kim, Younghoon; Shim, Kyuseok+INFORMATION SYSTEMS+JUN 2014::Short and Sparse Text Topic Modeling via Self-Aggregation+Quan, Xiaojun; Kit, Chunyu; Ge, Yong; et al.+PROCEEDINGS OF THE TWENTY-FOURTH INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (IJCAI)+2015::The author-topic model for authors and documents+Rosen-Zvi, Michal; Griffiths, Thomas; Steyvers, Mark<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Smyth, Padhraic</span>.+P 20 C UNC ART INT+2004::Bayesian analysis in Stata with WinBUGS+Thompson, John; Palmer, Tom; Moreno, Santiago+STATA JOURNAL+2006::txttool: Utilities for text analysis in Stata+Williams, Unislawa; Williams, Sean P.+STATA JOURNAL+2014::RANKING GENE-DRUG RELATIONSHIPS IN BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE USING LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION+Wu, Yonghui; Liu, Mei; Zheng, W.

Manipulation testing based on density discontinuity,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2018,16,0,"In this article, we introduce two community-contributed commands, rddensity and rdbwdensity, that implement automatic manipulation tests based on density discontinuity and are constructed using the results for local-polynomial density estimators in Cattaneo, Jansson, and Ma (2017b, Simple local polynomial density estimators, Working paper, University of Michigan). These new tests exhibit better size properties (and more power under additional assumptions) than other conventional approaches currently available in the literature. The first command, rddensity, implements manipulation tests based on a novel local-polynomial density estimation technique that avoids prebinning of the data (improving size properties) and allows for restrictions on other features of the model (improving power properties). The second command, rdbwdensity, implements several bandwidth selectors specifically tailored for the manipulation tests discussed herein.

Speaking Stata: Logarithmic binning and labeling,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2018,48,0,"Histograms on logarithmic scale cannot be produced by an option like xscale (log). You need first to transform the variable concerned with a logarithm function. That raises small choices: how to select bin start, bin width, and informative axis labels and titles? Problems and solutions are discussed here in detail.

In contrast, for logarithmic scales on other graphs, options xscale (log) and yscale (log) may do most of what you want. But there is usually still scope for ""nicer"" axis labels than are given by default and indeed scope for differing tastes on what ""nice"" means. This column introduces the niceloglabels command for helping (even automating) label choice.

Fixed-effects panel-data methods that estimate the unobserved effects can be severely biased because of the incidental parameter problem (Neyman and Scott, 1948, Econometrica 16: 1-32). We tackle this problem using the analytical and jackknife bias corrections derived in Fernandez-Val and Weidner (2016, Journal of Econometrics 192: 291-312) for panels where the two dimensions (N and T) are moderately large.

"Analyzing repeated measurements while accounting for derivative tracking, varying within-subject variance, and autocorrelation: The xtmixediou command",STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2017,22,0,"Linear mixed-effects models are commonly used to model trajectories of repeated measures of biomarkers of disease. Taylor, Cumberland, and Sy (1994, Journal of the American Statistical Association 89: 727-736) proposed a linear mixed-effects model with an added integrated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (IOU) process (linear mixed-effects IOU model). This allows for autocorrelation, changing within-subject variance, and the incorporation of derivative tracking (that is, how much a subject tends to maintain the same trajectory for extended periods of time). They argued that the covariance structure induced by the stochastic process in this model was interpretable and more biologically plausible than the standard linear mixed-effects model. However, their model is rarely used, partly because of the lack of available software. In this article, we present the new command xtmixediou, which fits the linear mixed-effects IOU model and its special case, the linear mixed-effects Brownian motion model. The model is fit to balanced and unbalanced data using restricted maximum-likelihood estimation, where the optimization algorithm is the Newton-Raphson, Fisher scoring, or average information algorithm, or any combination of these. To aid convergence, xtmixediou allows the user to change the method for deriving the starting values for optimization, the optimization algorithm, and the parameterization of the IOU process. We also provide a predict command to generate predictions under the model. We illustrate xtmixediou and predict with a simulated example of repeated biomarker measurements from HIV-positive patients.","st0487,xtmixediou,xtmixediou postestimation,autocorrelation,derivative tracking,integrated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,repeated-measures data,within-subject variability","LONGITUDINAL AIDS DATA,MIXED-EFFECTS MODELS,STOCHASTIC-MODEL,INFORMATION","Hughes, Rachael A.@Univ Bristol, Bristol Med Sch, Bristol, Avon, England::Sterne, Jonathan A.

Randomization inference with Stata: A guide and software,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2017,24,1,"Randomization inference or permutation tests are only sporadically used in economics and other social sciences-this despite a steep increase in randomization in field and laboratory experiments that provide perfect experimental setups for applying randomization inference. In the context of causal inference, such tests can handle problems often faced by applied researchers, including issues arising in the context of small samples, stratified or clustered treatment assignments, or nonstandard randomization techniques. Standard statistical software packages have either no implementation of randomization tests or very basic implementations. Whenever researchers use randomization inference, they regularly code individual program routines, risking inconsistencies and coding mistakes. In this article, I show how randomization inference can best be conducted in Stata and introduce a new command, ritest, to simplify such analyses. I illustrate this approach's usefulness by replicating the results in Fujiwara and Wantchekon (2013, American Economic Journal: Applied Economics 5: 241-255) and running simulations. The applications cover clustered and stratified assignments, with varying cluster sizes, pairwise randomization, and the computation of nonapproximate p-values.

Evaluating the maximum MSE of mean estimators with missing data,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2017,5,0,"In this article, we present the wald_mse command, which computes the maximum mean squared error of a user-specified point estimator of the mean for a population of interest in the presence of missing data. As pointed out by Manski (1989, Journal of Human Resources 24: 343-360; 2007, Journal of Econometrics 139: 105-115), the presence of missing data results in the loss of point identification of the mean unless one is willing to make strong assumptions about the nature of the missing data. Despite this, decision makers may be interested in reporting a single number as their estimate of the mean as opposed to an estimate of the identified set. It is not obvious which estimator of the mean is best suited to this task, and there may not exist a universally best choice in all settings. To evaluate the performance of a given point estimator of the mean, wald_mse allows the decision maker to compute the maximum mean squared error of an arbitrary estimator under a flexible specification of the missing-data process.","st0494,wald_mse,maximum mean squared error",,"Manski, Charles F.@Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA::Tabord-Meehan, Max@Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA","Manski, Charles F.@Northwestern University::Tabord-Meehan, Max@Northwestern University",not exist,"More data or better data: A statistical decision problem+[Anonymous].+Review of Economic Studies+no time::MEASURING AND INTERPRETING EXPECTATIONS OF EQUITY RETURNS+Dominitz, Jeff; Manski, Charles F.+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+APR-MAY 2011::SOME PROBLEMS IN MINIMAX POINT ESTIMATION+HODGES, JL; LEHMANN, EL+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1950::ANATOMY OF THE SELECTION PROBLEM+MANSKI, CF+JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCES+SUM 1989::Minimax-regret treatment choice with missing outcome data+Manski, Charles F.+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUL 2007"

Estimating inverse-probability weights for longitudinal data with dropout or truncation: The xtrccipw command,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2017,23,1,"Individuals may drop out of a longitudinal study, rendering their outcomes unobserved but still well defined. However, they may also undergo truncation (for example, death), beyond which their outcomes are no longer meaningful. Kurland and Heagerty (2005, Biostatistics 6: 241-258) developed a method to conduct regression conditioning on nontruncation, that is, regression conditioning on continuation (RCC), for longitudinal outcomes that are monotonically missing at random (for example, because of dropout). This method first estimates the probability of dropout among continuing individuals to construct inverse-probability weights (IPWs), then fits generalized estimating equations (GEE) with these IPWs. In this article, we present the xtrccipw command, which can both estimate the IPWs required by RCC and then use these IPWs in a GEE estimator by calling the glm command from within xtrccipw. In the absence of truncation, the xtrccipw command can also be used to run a weighted GEE analysis. We demonstrate the xtrccipw command by analyzing an example dataset and the original Kurland and Heagerty (2005) data. We also use xtrccipw to illustrate some empirical properties of RCC through a simulation study.","st0474,xtrccipw,dropout,generalized estimating equations,inverse probability weights,longitudinal data,missing at random,truncation,weighted GEE","QUALITY-OF-LIFE,MISSING DATA,MODELS,DEATH,INFERENCE,OUTCOMES","Daza, Eric J.@Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Stanford Prevent Res Ctr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA::Hudgens, Michael G.@Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Biostat, Chapel Hill, NC USA::Herring, Amy H.@Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Biostat, Chapel Hill, NC USA@Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Carolina Populat Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC USA","Daza, Eric J.@Stanford University::Hudgens, Michael G.@University of North Carolina@University of North Carolina Chapel Hill::Herring, Amy H.@University of North Carolina@University of North Carolina Chapel Hill","Daza, Eric J.@L-1896-2018@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8376-1600","ESTIMATING LIFETIME OR EPISODE-OF-ILLNESS COSTS UNDER CENSORING+Basu, Anirban; Manning, Willard G.+HEALTH ECONOMICS+SEP 2010::Simultaneous analysis of quality of life and survival data+Billingham, LJ; Abrams, KR+STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH+FEB 2002::no title+Diggle, P.; Heagerty, P.; Liang, K.

A combined test for a generalized treatment effect in clinical trials with a time-to-event outcome,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2017,10,1,"Most randomized controlled trials with a time-to-event outcome are designed and analyzed assuming proportional hazards of the treatment effect. The sample-size calculation is based on a log-rank test or the equivalent Cox test. Nonproportional hazards are seen increasingly in trials and are recognized as a potential threat to the power of the log-rank test. To address the issue, Royston and Parmar (2016, BMC Medical Research Methodology 16: 16) devised a new ""combined test"" of the global null hypothesis of identical survival curves in each trial arm. The test, which combines the conventional Cox test with a new formulation, is based on the maximal standardized difference in restricted mean survival time (RMST) between the arms. The test statistic is based on evaluations of RMST over several preselected time points. The combined test involves the minimum p-value across the Cox and RMST-based tests, appropriately standardized to have the correct null distribution. In this article, I outline the combined test and introduce a command, stctest, that implements the combined test. I point the way to additional tools currently under development for power and sample-size calculation for the combined test.","st0479,stctest,randomized controlled trial,time-to-event outcome,restricted mean survival time,treatment effect,hypothesis testing,flexible parametric model,jackknife","MEAN SURVIVAL-TIME,REGRESSION-ANALYSIS,PSEUDO-OBSERVATIONS,MODELS","Royston, Patrick@UCL, MRC Clin Trials Unit, London, England","Royston, Patrick@University College London@University of London@Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit",not exist,"Regression analysis of restricted mean survival time based on pseudo-observations+Andersen, PK; Hansen, MG; Klein, JP+LIFETIME DATA ANALYSIS+DEC 2004::strmst2 and strmst2pw: New commands to compare survival curves using the restricted mean survival time+Cronin, Angel; Tian, Lu; Uno, Hajime+STATA JOURNAL+2016::Further development of flexible parametric models for survival analysis+Lambert, Paul C.; Royston, Patrick+STATA JOURNAL+2009::Comparison of techniques for handling missing covariate data within prognostic modelling studies: a simulation study+Marshall, Andrea; Altman, Douglas G.; Royston, Patrick; et al.+BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY+JAN 19 2010::Regression analysis of censored data using pseudo-observations: An update+Overgaard, Morten; Andersen, Per K.; Parner, Erik T.+Stata Journal+2015::Regression analysis of censored data using pseudo-observations+Parner, Erik T.; Andersen, Per K.+STATA JOURNAL+2010::Flexible parametric proportional-hazards and proportional-odds models for censored survival data, with application to prognostic modelling and estimation of treatment effects+Royston, P; Parmar, MKB+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+AUG 15 2002::Estimating the treatment effect in a clinical trial using difference in restricted mean survival time+Royston, Patrick+STATA JOURNAL+2015::Penicillin to Prevent Recurrent Leg Cellulitis+Thomas, Kim S.; Crook, Angela M.; Nunn, Andrew J.; et al.+NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE+MAY 2 2013::Comparison of Treatment Effects Measured by the Hazard Ratio and by the Ratio of Restricted Mean Survival Times in Oncology Randomized Controlled Trials+Trinquart, Ludovic; Jacot, Justine; Conner, Sarah C.; et al.+JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY+MAY 20 2016"

Automatic portmanteau tests with applications to market risk management,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2017,25,0,"In this article, we review some recent advances in testing for serial correlation, provide code for implementation, and illustrate this code's application to market risk forecast evaluation. We focus on the classic and widely used portmanteau tests and their data-driven versions. These tests are simple to implement for two reasons: First, the researcher does not need to specify the order of the tested autocorrelations, because the test automatically chooses this number. Second, its asymptotic null distribution is chi-squared with one degree of freedom, so there is no need to use a bootstrap procedure to estimate the critical values. We illustrate the wide applicability of this methodology with applications to forecast evaluation for market risk measures such as value-at-risk and expected shortfall.","st0504,dbptest,rtau,autocorrelation,consistency,power,Akaike's information criterion,Schwarz's Bayesian information criterion,market risk",TIME-SERIES MODELS,"Zhu, Guangwei@Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Chinese Financial Studies, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China::Du, Zaichao@Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China::Escanciano, Juan Carlos@Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Zhu, Guangwei@South Western University of Finance & Economics - China::Du, Zaichao@South Western University of Finance & Economics - China::Escanciano, Juan Carlos@Indiana University Bloomington@Indiana University System",not exist,"NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::Evaluating Value-at-Risk Models with Desk-Level Data+Berkowitz, Jeremy; Christoffersen, Peter; Pelletier, Denis+MANAGEMENT SCIENCE+DEC 2011::Distribution of residual autocorrelations in autoregressive-integrated moving average time series models+Box,, G.

Two-stage residual inclusion estimation: A practitioners guide to Stata implementation,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2017,14,0,"Empirical econometric research often requires implementation of nonlinear models whose regressors include one or more endogenous variables regressors that are correlated with the unobserved random component of the model. In such cases, conventional regression methods that ignore endogeneity will likely produce biased results that are not causally interpretable. Terza, Basu, and Rathouz (2008, Journal of Health Economics 27: 531-543) discuss a relatively simple estimation method (two-stage residual inclusion) that avoids endogeneity bias, is applicable in many nonlinear regression contexts, and can easily be implemented in Stata. In this article, I offer a step-by-step protocol to implement the two-stage residual inclusion method in Stata. I illustrate this protocol in the context of a real-data example.

Causal effect estimation and inference using Stata,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2017,9,0,"Terza (2016b, Health Services Research 51: 1109-1113) gives the correct generic expression for the asymptotic standard errors of statistics formed as sample means of nonlinear data transformations. In this article, I assess the performance of the Stata margins command as a relatively simple alternative for calculating such standard errors. I note that margins is not available for all packaged nonlinear regression commands in Stata and cannot be implemented in conjunction with user-defined-and-coded nonlinear estimation protocols that do not make a predict command available. When margins is available, however, I establish (using a real-data example) that it produces standard errors that are asymptotically equivalent to those obtained from the formulations in Terza (2016b) and the appendix available with this article. This result favors using margins (with its relative coding simplicity) when available. In all other cases, use Mata to code the standard-error formulations in Terza (2016b).

Regression clustering for panel-data models with fixed effects,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2017,6,0,"In this article, we describe the xtregcluster command, which implements the panel regression clustering approach developed by Sarafidis and Weber (2015, Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics 77: 274-296). The method classifies individuals into clusters, so that within each cluster, the slope parameters are homogeneous and all intracluster heterogeneity is due to the standard two-way error-components structure. Because the clusters are heterogeneous, they do not share common parameters. The number of clusters and the optimal partition are determined by the clustering solution, which minimizes the total residual sum of squares of the model subject to a penalty function that strictly increases in the number of clusters. The method is available for linear short panel-data models and useful for exploring heterogeneity in the slope parameters when there is no a priori knowledge about parameter structures. It is also useful for empirically evaluating whether any normative classifications are justifiable from a statistical point of view.","st0475,xtregcluster,panel data,parameter heterogeneity",,"Christodoulou, Demetris@Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia::Sarafidis, Vasilis@Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","Christodoulou, Demetris@University of Sydney::Sarafidis, Vasilis@Monash University",not exist,"Pooled estimators vs their heterogeneous counterparts in the context of dynamic demand for gasoline+Baltagi, BH; Griffin, JM+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+APR 1997::Production function regressions, returns to scale, and externalities+Burnside, C+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+APR 1996::no title+Everitt, B.

StataStan fits a more general range of models than can be fit by bayesmh and uses a superior sampling algorithm, that is, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo using the no-U-turn sampler. Furthermore, StataStan can run in parallel on multiple CPU cores, regardless of the flavor of Stata.

I illustrate the estimation of both classes of models using sample datasets shipped with the statistical software aML. I pay special attention to identifying structural coefficients in nonrecursive simultaneous systems.","st0481,survival analysis,multilevel multiprocess models,multilevel analysis,simultaneous equations,endogeneity,gsem","CHILDBEARING,MARRIAGE,COHABITATION,FERTILITY,VARIABLES,EDUCATION,RATES,CMP","Bartus, Tamas@Corvinus Univ Budapest, Sociol, Budapest, Hungary","Bartus, Tamas@Corvinus University Budapest",not exist,"Estimation of multiprocess survival models with cmp+Bartus, Tamas; Roodman, David+STATA JOURNAL+2014::DUMMY ENDOGENOUS VARIABLES IN A SIMULTANEOUS EQUATION SYSTEM+HECKMAN, JJ+ECONOMETRICA+1978::THE ANALYSIS OF RATES AND OF SURVIVORSHIP USING LOG-LINEAR MODELS+HOLFORD, TR+BIOMETRICS+1980::Secularization, Union Formation Practices, and Marital Stability: Evidence from Italy+Impicciatore, Roberto; Billari, Francesco C.+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POPULATION-REVUE EUROPEENNE DE DEMOGRAPHIE+MAY 2012::The high fertility of college educated women in Norway+Kravdal, O.+Demogr Res+2001::Effects of current education on second- and third-birth rates among Norwegian women and men born in 1964: Substantive interpretations and methodological issues+Kravdal, Oystein+DEMOGRAPHIC RESEARCH+NOV 13 2007::IDENTIFICATION AND ESTIMATION IN BINARY CHOICE MODELS WITH LIMITED (CENSORED) DEPENDENT VARIABLES+LEE, LF+ECONOMETRICA+1979::no title+Lillard, L; Panis, C.

A flexible parametric competing-risks model using a direct likelihood approach for the cause-specific cumulative incidence function,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2017,24,1,"In competing-risks analysis, the cause-specific cumulative incidence function (CIF) is usually obtained in a modeling framework by either 1) transforming on all cause-specific hazards or 2) transforming by using a direct relationship with the subdistribution hazard function. We expand on current competing-risks methodology from within the flexible parametric survival modeling framework and focus on the second approach. This approach models all cause-specific CIFs simultaneously and is more useful for answering prognostic-related questions. We propose the direct flexible parametric survival modeling approach for the cause specific CIF. This approach models the (log cumulative) baseline hazard without requiring numerical integration, which leads to benefits in computational time. It is also easy to make out-of-sample predictions to estimate more useful measures and incorporate alternative link functions, for example, logit links. To implement these methods, we introduce a new estimation command, stpm2cr, and demonstrate useful predictions from the model through an illustrative melanoma dataset.","st0482,stpm2cr,survival analysis,competing risks,flexible parametric models,subdistribution hazard,cumulative incidence function","POPULATION-BASED-CANCER,SURVIVAL ANALYSIS,PROPORTIONAL-HAZARDS,REGRESSION-MODELS,SUBDISTRIBUTION,CURE","Mozumder, Sarwar Islam@Univ Leicester, Dept Hlth Sci, Leicester, Leics, England::Rutherford, Mark J.@Univ Leicester, Dept Hlth Sci, Leicester, Leics, England::Lambert, Paul C.@Univ Leicester, Dept Hlth Sci, Leicester, Leics, England@Karolinska Inst, Med Epidemiol & Biostat, Stockholm, Sweden","Mozumder, Sarwar Islam@University of Leicester::Rutherford, Mark J.@University of Leicester::Lambert, Paul C.@University of Leicester@Karolinska Institutet",not exist,"Competing risks in epidemiology: possibilities and pitfalls+Andersen, Per Kragh; Geskus, Ronald B.; de Witte, Theo; et al.+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+JUN 2012::Estimating and modelling cure in population-based cancer studies within the framework of flexible parametric survival models+Andersson, Therese M.

Within- and between-cluster effects in generalized linear mixed models: A discussion of approaches and the xthybrid command,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2017,40,2,"One typically analyzes clustered data using random- or fixed-effects models. Fixed-effects models allow consistent estimation of the effects of level-one variables, even if there is unobserved heterogeneity at level two. However, these models cannot estimate the effects of level-two variables. Hybrid and correlated random-effects models are flexible modeling specifications that separate within and between-cluster effects and allow for both consistent estimation of level-one effects and inclusion of level-two variables. In this article, we elaborate on the separation of within- and between-cluster effects in generalized linear mixed models.

The estimation and modeling of cause-specific cumulative incidence functions using time-dependent weights,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2017,20,0,"Competing risks occur in survival analysis when an individual is at risk of more than one type of event and one event's occurrence precludes another's. The cause-specific cumulative incidence function (CIF) is a measure of interest with competing-risks data. It gives the absolute (or crude) risk of having the event by time t, accounting for the fact that it is impossible to have the event if a competing event occurs first. The user-written command stcompet calculates nonparametric estimates of the cause-specific CIF, and the official Stata command stcrreg fits the Fine and Gray (1999, Journal of the American Statistical Association 94: 496-509) model for competing-risks data. Geskus (2011, Biometrics 67: 39-49) has recently shown that standard software can estimate some of the key measures in competing risks by restructuring the data and incorporating weights. This has a number of advantages because any tools developed for standard survival analysis can then be used to analyze competing-risks data. In this article, I describe the stcrprep command, which restructures the data and calculates the appropriate weights. After one uses stcrprep, a number of standard Stata survival analysis commands can then be used to analyze competing risks. For example, sts graph, failure will give a plot of the cause-specific CIF, and stcox will fit the Fine and Gray (1999) proportional subhazards model. Using stcrprep together with stcox is computationally much more efficient than using stcrreg. In addition, stcrprep opens up new opportunities for competing-risk models. I illustrate this by fitting flexible parametric survival models to the expanded data to directly model the cause-specific CIF.","st0471,stcrprep,survival analysis,competing risks,time-dependent effects","COMPETING RISKS DATA,PROPORTIONAL-HAZARDS,MULTISTATE MODELS,REGRESSION","Lambert, Paul C.@Univ Leicester, Dept Hlth Sci, Leicester, Leics, England@Karolinska Inst, Med Epidemiol & Biostat, Stockholm, Sweden","Lambert, Paul C.@University of Leicester@Karolinska Institutet",not exist,"Cumulative incidence estimation in the presence of competing risks+Coviello, V.; Boggess, M.+Stata Journal+2004::mstate: An R Package for the Analysis of Competing Risks and Multi-State Models+de Wreede, Liesbeth C.; Fiocco, Marta; Putter, Hein+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL SOFTWARE+JAN 2011::A proportional hazards model for the subdistribution of a competing risk+Fine, JP; Gray, RJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1999::Analysing competing risks data with transformation models+Fine, JP+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1999::Absolute risk regression for competing risks: interpretation, link functions, and prediction+Gerds, Thomas A.; Scheike, Thomas H.; Andersen, Per K.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+DEC 20 2012::Cause-Specific Cumulative Incidence Estimation and the Fine and Gray Model Under Both Left Truncation and Right Censoring+Geskus, Ronald B.+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2011::Number needed to treat for time-to-event data with competing risks+Gouskov, Natalia A.; Kundu, Suprateek; Imrey, Peter B.; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JAN 30 2014::A CLASS OF K-SAMPLE TESTS FOR COMPARING THE CUMULATIVE INCIDENCE OF A COMPETING RISK+GRAY, RJ+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+SEP 1988::Direct parametric inference for the cumulative incidence function+Jeong, JH; Fine, J+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2006::Parametric regression on cumulative incidence function+Jeong, Jong-Hyeon; Fine, Jason P.+BIOSTATISTICS+APR 2007::no title+KALBFLEISCH, J.

These help the investigator visually evaluate the performance of the new measurement method.

Estimating survival functions after stcox with time-varying coefficients,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2016,8,1,"In many applications of the Cox model, the proportional-hazards assumption is implausible. In these cases, the solution to nonproportional hazards usually consists of modeling the effect of the variable of interest and its interaction effect with some function of time. Although Stata provides a command to implement this interaction in stcox, it does not allow the typical visualizations using stcurve if stcox was estimated with the tvc() option.

Rethinking literate programming in statistics,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2016,28,0,"Literate programming is becoming increasingly trendy for data analysis because it allows the generation of dynamic-analysis reports for communicating data analysis and eliminates untraceable human errors in analysis reports. Traditionally, literate programming includes separate processes for compiling the code and preparing the documentation. While this workflow might be satisfactory for software documentation, it is not ideal for writing statistical analysis reports. Instead, these processes should run in parallel. In this article, I introduce the weaver package, which examines this idea by creating a new log system in HTML or LATEX that can be used simultaneously with the Stata log system. The new log system provides many features that the Stata log system lacks; for example, it can render mathematical notations, insert figures, create publication-ready dynamic tables, and style text, and it includes a built-in syntax highlighter. The weaver package also produces dynamic PDF documents by converting the HTML log to PDF or by typesetting the LATEX log and thus provides a real-time preview of the document without recompiling the code. I also discuss potential applications of the weaver package.","pr0063,weave,div,img,txt,tbl,weaver,weaving,literate programming,dynamic documents,reproducible research,log,HTML,LATEX",,"Haghish, E.

strcs: A command for fitting flexible parametric survival models on the log-hazard scale,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2016,19,1,"In this article, we describe strcs, a user-written command for fitting flexible parametric survival models on the log-hazard scale. strcs is an extension of the user-written stgenreg command (Crowther and Lambert, 2013b, Journal of Statistical Software 53(12): 1-17), which fits general parametric models with user-defined hazard functions using numerical integration. strcs implements a two-step method that incorporates both analytical and numerical integration to estimate the cumulative hazard function required for the log-likelihood function. This method improves the accuracy of the fully numeric estimation implemented in stgenreg. Time-dependent effects can be incorporated, and excess mortality models can be fit by using the available options. We also describe some of the extensive postestimation commands that are easily implemented after fitting an strcs model.","st0462,strcs,strcs postestimation,flexible parametric survival model,log-hazard scale","REGRESSION-MODELS,RELATIVE SURVIVAL,CUBIC-SPLINES,FRAMEWORK","Bower, Hannah@Karolinska Inst, Dept Med Epidemiol & Biostat, Stockholm, Sweden::Crowther, Michael J.@Karolinska Inst, Dept Med Epidemiol & Biostat, Stockholm, Sweden@Univ Leicester, Dept Hlth Sci, Leicester, Leics, England::Lambert, Paul C.@Karolinska Inst, Dept Med Epidemiol & Biostat, Stockholm, Sweden@Univ Leicester, Dept Hlth Sci, Leicester, Leics, England","Bower, Hannah@Karolinska Institutet::Crowther, Michael J.@University of Leicester@Karolinska Institutet::Lambert, Paul C.@University of Leicester@Karolinska Institutet","Crowther, Michael@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8378-8259","Estimating and modelling cure in population-based cancer studies within the framework of flexible parametric survival models+Andersson, Therese M.

Speaking Stata: Letter values as selected quantiles,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2016,35,0,"Letter values were introduced and named by J. W. Tukey in the 1970s as selected quantiles. The idea is to choose a small set of quantiles to characterize an ordered sample of values, quantiles that are each defined as either individual order statistics or the mean of two such statistics. The procedure is to start with the median, to continue with quartiles, and then with first and last octiles, and so on. At each step, approximate medians are identified of successively smaller tail fractions until the extremes, the minimum and maximum, are reached. As a historical aside, the same idea can be identified in work by Francis Galton from 1880.

Letter values are supported by Stata through the official command 1v, but that command is geared to letter-value displays and (arbitrarily) will compute no more than 21 letter values. A new command, lvalues, is introduced that supports calculation of letter values without such limits and is designed to save results in new variables for as many variables and distinct groups as are specified. Results may then be easily listed and (especially) plotted in pursuit of identification and comparison of distribution level, spread, and shape. Examples are given with emphasis on quantile plots.","st0465,lvalues,letter values,order statistics,quantiles,distributions,level,spread,shape,skewness,exploratory data analysis,graphics","GALTON,FRANCIS","Cox, Nicholas J.@Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham, England","Cox, Nicholas J.@Durham University",not exist,"Francis Galton and the invention of terms for quantiles+Aronson, JK+JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY+DEC 2001::no title+Bowley, A.

The Keane and Runkle estimator for panel-data models with serial correlation and instruments that are not strictly exogenous,STATA JOURNAL,NO DOI,2016,18,1,"In this article, we introduce the new command xtkr, which implements the Keane and Runkle (1992a, Journal of Business and Economic Statistics 10: 19) approach for fitting linear panel-data models when the available instruments are predetermined but not strictly exogenous. This is a common case that includes dynamic panel-data models as a leading example. Monte Carlo simulations show that, in certain situations, this approach offers an improvement over the popular difference generalized method of moments and system generalized method of moments estimators in terms of bias and root mean squared error. An empirical application to cigarette demand also demonstrates its usefulness for applied researchers.","st0443,xtkr,forward filtering,GMM,panel data,lagged dependent variable,endogeneity,strict exogeneity,predetermination","MOMENT RESTRICTIONS,GMM","Keane, Michael@Univ Oxford, Econ, Oxford, England::Neal, Timothy@Univ New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Keane, Michael@University of Oxford::Neal, Timothy@University of New South Wales Sydney","Keane, Michael@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3918-1377","EFFICIENT ESTIMATION OF MODELS FOR DYNAMIC PANEL-DATA+AHN, SC; SCHMIDT, P+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUL 1995::ANOTHER LOOK AT THE INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE ESTIMATION OF ERROR-COMPONENTS MODELS+ARELLANO, M; BOVER, O+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUL 1995::SOME TESTS OF SPECIFICATION FOR PANEL DATA - MONTE-CARLO EVIDENCE AND AN APPLICATION TO EMPLOYMENT EQUATIONS+ARELLANO, M; BOND, S+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+APR 1991::no title+Baltagi, Badi H.+Econometric Analysis of Panel Data+2005::Initial conditions and moment restrictions in dynamic panel data models+Blundell, R; Bond, S+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+NOV 1998::SEQUENTIAL MOMENT RESTRICTIONS IN PANEL DATA - COMMENT+CHAMBERLAIN, G+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JAN 1992::ON THE ESTIMATION OF PANEL-DATA MODELS WITH SERIAL-CORRELATION WHEN INSTRUMENTS ARE NOT STRICTLY EXOGENOUS - COMMENT+HAYASHI, F+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JAN 1992::ESTIMATING VECTOR AUTOREGRESSIONS WITH PANEL DATA+HOLTZEAKIN, D; NEWEY, W; ROSEN, HS+ECONOMETRICA+NOV 1988::Modeling heterogeneity and state dependence in consumer choice behavior+Keane, MP+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JUL 1997::ON THE ESTIMATION OF PANEL-DATA MODELS WITH SERIAL-CORRELATION WHEN INSTRUMENTS ARE NOT STRICTLY EXOGENOUS+KEANE, MP; RUNKLE, DE+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JAN 1992::ON THE ESTIMATION OF PANEL-DATA MODELS WITH SERIAL-CORRELATION WHEN INSTRUMENTS ARE NOT STRICTLY EXOGENOUS - REPLY+KEANE, MP; RUNKLE, DE+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JAN 1992::GMM inference when the number of moment conditions is large+Koenker, R; Machado, JAF+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+DEC 1999::BIASES IN DYNAMIC-MODELS WITH FIXED EFFECTS+NICKELL, S+ECONOMETRICA+1981::A Note on the Theme of Too Many Instruments+Roodman, David+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+FEB 2009::How to do xtabond2: An introduction to difference and system GMM in Stata+Roodman, David+STATA JOURNAL+2009::ON THE ESTIMATION OF PANEL-DATA MODELS WITH SERIAL-CORRELATION WHEN INSTRUMENTS ARE NOT STRICTLY EXOGENOUS - COMMENT+SCHMIDT, P; AHN, SC; WYHOWSKI, D+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JAN 1992::A finite sample correction for the variance of linear efficient two-step GMM estimators+Windmeijer, F+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+MAY 2005::Efficient estimation with panel data when instruments are predetermined: An empirical comparison of moment-condition estimators+Ziliak, JP+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+OCT 1997"
